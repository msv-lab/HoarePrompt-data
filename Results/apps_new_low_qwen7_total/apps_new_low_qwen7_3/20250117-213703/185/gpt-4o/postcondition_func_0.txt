The function processes three non-negative integer values `l`, `r`, and `a` (where \(0 \leq l, r, a \leq 100\)) obtained from user input. It first adjusts the values of `l` and `r` based on their relative sizes and the value of `a`. Specifically, if `l < r`, then `l` is increased by the minimum of `a` and `r - l`. If `r < l`, then `r` is adjusted to `r + min(a, l - r)`, and `a` is updated accordingly. In both cases, `a` is reduced by the minimum amount used for adjustment.

After adjusting `l` and `r`, the function calculates the maximum possible team size (`max_team_size`) as `l + r + a // 2 * 2`. If this calculated value is odd, `max_team_size` is decremented by 1 to ensure it is even. Finally, the function prints the computed `max_team_size`.

Potential edge cases include when `a` is zero or when `l` equals `r`. If `a` is zero, the adjustments to `l` and `r` will not occur, and the final `max_team_size` will simply be the sum of `l`, `r`, and any remaining `a` (which will be zero). When `l` equals `r`, the adjustments will be made based on the value of `a`, and the final `max_team_size` will be adjusted accordingly.
