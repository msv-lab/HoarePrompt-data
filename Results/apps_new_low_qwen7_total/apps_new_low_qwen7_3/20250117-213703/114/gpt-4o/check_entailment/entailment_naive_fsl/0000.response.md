Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `k` is 0. According to the problem description, if `k` is 0, the k-rounding of `n` should be `n` itself since it already ends with 0 or more zeros. However, the current implementation always multiplies `n` by a power of 10, which is incorrect when `k` is 0.

For example, consider the input:
```
38101 0
```
The expected output is `38101`, but the program outputs a different value because it unnecessarily multiplies `n` by 10^0 (which is 1), and this does not change the value of `n`.

To fix this, you can add a special case when `k` is 0:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if k == 0:
        return n
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
```

This ensures that when `k` is 0, the function returns `n` directly, satisfying the problem description.
