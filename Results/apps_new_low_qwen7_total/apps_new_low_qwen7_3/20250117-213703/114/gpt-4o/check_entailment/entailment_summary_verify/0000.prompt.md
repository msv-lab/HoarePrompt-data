You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
For a given positive integer n denote its k-rounding as the minimum positive integer x, such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

For example, 4-rounding of 375 is 375·80 = 30000. 30000 is the minimum integer such that it ends with 4 or more zeros and is divisible by 375.

Write a program that will perform the k-rounding of n.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ k ≤ 8).


-----Output-----

Print the k-rounding of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
375 4

Output
30000

Input
10000 1

Output
10000

Input
38101 0

Output
38101

Input
123456789 8

Output
12345678900000000

- Program:
import math

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `k`, an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. It calculates `multiplier` as 10 raised to the power of `k`. Then, it computes `x` as `n` multiplied by the integer division of `multiplier` by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `multiplier`. Finally, it returns `x`, which simplifies to `n * 10`. This is because `10

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `k` is 0. According to the problem description, if `k` is 0, the k-rounding of `n` should be `n` itself since it already ends with 0 or more zeros. However, the current implementation always multiplies `n` by a power of 10, which is incorrect when `k` is 0.

For example, consider the input:
```
38101 0
```
The expected output is `38101`, but the program outputs a different value because it unnecessarily multiplies `n` by 10^0 (which is 1), and this does not change the value of `n`.

To fix this, you can add a special case when `k` is 0:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if k == 0:
        return n
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
```

This ensures that when `k` is 0, the function returns `n` directly, satisfying the problem description.
