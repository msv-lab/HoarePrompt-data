You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
For a given positive integer n denote its k-rounding as the minimum positive integer x, such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

For example, 4-rounding of 375 is 375·80 = 30000. 30000 is the minimum integer such that it ends with 4 or more zeros and is divisible by 375.

Write a program that will perform the k-rounding of n.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ k ≤ 8).


-----Output-----

Print the k-rounding of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
375 4

Output
30000

Input
10000 1

Output
10000

Input
38101 0

Output
38101

Input
123456789 8

Output
12345678900000000

- Program: 
import math

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x



- Annotated Code: 
import math

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 8.
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k

x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is n * 10



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program aims to find the k-rounding of a given number `n`. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum positive integer `x` that ends with `k` or more zeros and is divisible by `n`.

Here's how the solution works:
1. **Multiplier Calculation**: 
   - `multiplier = 10 ** k`: This calculates the smallest power of 10 that has `k` or more zeros.
2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - `math.gcd(n, multiplier)`: This finds the greatest common divisor between `n` and the `multiplier`.
3. **Adjustment for K-Rounding**:
   - `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`: This step adjusts `n` by multiplying it with the quotient of `multiplier` divided by their GCD. This ensures that the result is the smallest multiple of `n` that ends with `k` or more zeros.

Let's test this with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `375 4`
   - `multiplier = 10000`
   - `math.gcd(375, 10000) = 125`
   - `x = 375 * (10000 // 125) = 375 * 80 = 30000`
   - Correct Output: `30000`

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `10000 1`
   - `multiplier = 10`
   - `math.gcd(10000, 10) = 10`
   - `x = 10000 * (10 // 10) = 10000 * 1 = 10000`
   - Correct Output: `10000`

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `38101 0`
   - `multiplier = 1`
   - `math.gcd(38101, 1) = 1`
   - `x = 38101 * (1 // 1) = 38101 * 1 = 38101`
   - Correct Output: `38101`

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `123456789 8`
   - `multiplier = 100000000`
   - `math.gcd(123456789, 100000000) = 1`
   - `x = 123456789 * (100000000 // 1) = 123456789 * 100000000 = 12345678900000000`
   - Correct Output: `12345678900000000`

Given that the program correctly handles all provided examples and follows the logic required for k-rounding, the implementation is correct.
