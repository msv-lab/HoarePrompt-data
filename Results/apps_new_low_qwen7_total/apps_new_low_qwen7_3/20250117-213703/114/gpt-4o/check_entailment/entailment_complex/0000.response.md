Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the k-rounding of a number \( n \), which is defined as the smallest multiple of \( n \) that ends in at least \( k \) zeros.
2. The given function `func_1` should compute this correctly.
3. Let's break down the logic of `func_1`:
   - `multiplier = 10 ** k`: This sets up the smallest number with \( k \) zeros.
   - `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`: This line aims to find the smallest multiple of `n` that ends in at least \( k \) zeros by ensuring the result is divisible by both `n` and the `multiplier`.
4. To ensure correctness, let's consider key properties:
   - For any integer \( n \) and non-negative integer \( k \), the smallest number ending in at least \( k \) zeros and divisible by \( n \) can be written as \( \text{LCM}(n, 10^k) \).
   - The expression \( n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)) \) indeed finds the least common multiple (LCM) of \( n \) and \( 10^k \) since LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).
5. Given the constraints and the approach, the function should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Based on this reasoning, the provided function `func_1` should correctly compute the k-rounding of \( n \).

Correctness: **True**
