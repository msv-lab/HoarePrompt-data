The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `k`, an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. It calculates `multiplier` as 10 raised to the power of `k`. Then, it computes `x` as `n` multiplied by the integer division of `multiplier` by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `multiplier`. Finally, it returns `x`, which simplifies to `n * 10`. This is because `10
