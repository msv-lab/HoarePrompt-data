#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 8.
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k

x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is n * 10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `k`, an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. It calculates `multiplier` as 10 raised to the power of `k`. Then, it computes `x` as `n` multiplied by the integer division of `multiplier` by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `multiplier`. Finally, it returns `x`, which simplifies to `n * 10`. This is because `10
