Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 8, x is n * (10 ** k)**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates `multiplier` as `10 ** k`. This value is an integer power of 10 based on the value of `k`.
- The second line computes `x` as `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. Here, `math.gcd(n, multiplier)` finds the greatest common divisor of `n` and `10 ** k`. Since `10 ** k` is a power of 10, its prime factors are 2 and 5. If `n` has no common factors with `10 ** k`, then `math.gcd(n, multiplier) = 1` and `x = n * (10 ** k)`. If `n` shares common factors with `10 ** k`, these factors will be canceled out, but since `10 ** k` is a power of 10, the result will still be a multiple of `10 ** (k - number of shared factors)`. In both cases, `x` will be a multiple of `10 ** k`.

Thus, the final state includes the original `n` and `k`, and introduces a new variable `x` which is a multiple of `10 ** k`.
