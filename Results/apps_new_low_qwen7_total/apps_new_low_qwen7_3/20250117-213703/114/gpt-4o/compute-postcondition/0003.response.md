Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `k`, an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. It calculates `multiplier` as 10 raised to the power of `k`. Then, it computes `x` as `n` multiplied by the integer division of `multiplier` by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `multiplier`. Finally, it returns `x`, which simplifies to `n * 10`. This is because `10**k` and `n` share no common factors other than 1 when `k` is within the given range, making their GCD equal to 1, thus `x = n * (10**k // 1) = n * 10`. Potential edge cases include when `k` is 0, in which case `multiplier` is 1 and `x` remains `n`. The function does not have any missing logic; however, it assumes that `math.gcd` is available.**

Note: The annotations in the original code suggest that the function returns `n * 10`, but the actual computation is based on the GCD, ensuring the result is always `n * 10` for valid `k` values.
