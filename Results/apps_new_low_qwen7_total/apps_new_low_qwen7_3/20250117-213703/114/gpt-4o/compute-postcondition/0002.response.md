The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, and `k`, which is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 8. After executing the function body, the function returns `x`, which is equal to `n * 10`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and return the value of `n * 10`.
