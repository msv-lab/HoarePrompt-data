Output State: **l_1 is max(l1, l2), r_1 is min(r1, r2), l_2 is unchanged, r_2 is unchanged, k is unchanged**

Explanation:
- The first line reads five integers from the input and assigns them to `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, and `k` respectively. However, since the actual input values are not provided, we keep the variables as `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, and `k`.
- The second line calculates `start` as the maximum of `l1` and `l2`, so `start` becomes `max(l1, l2)`.
- The third line calculates `end` as the minimum of `r1` and `r2`, so `end` becomes `min(r1, r2)`.

All other variables (`l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
