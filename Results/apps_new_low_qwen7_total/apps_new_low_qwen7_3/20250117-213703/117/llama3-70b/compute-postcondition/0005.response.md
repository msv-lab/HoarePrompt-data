The function `func` accepts five parameters: `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2`, and `k`. These parameters are integers with the following constraints: 1 ≤ `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2`, `k` ≤ 10^18, `l_1` ≤ `r_1`, `l_2` ≤ `r_2`, and `k` is within the range [`l_2`, `r_2`]. The function does not have any specific return value or conditions described other than the parameter constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept five integer parameters `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2`, and `k` under specified constraints, without returning any specific value based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2`, and `k`, which are integers with given constraints, but does not return any specific value.**
