Functionality: **The function accepts five integer parameters \( l_1 \), \( r_1 \), \( l_2 \), \( r_2 \), and \( k \). It calculates the maximum number of minutes during which two intervals overlap, where the first interval is \([l_1, r_1]\) and the second interval is \([l_2, r_2]\). The function ensures that both intervals are valid (i.e., \( l_1 \leq r_1 \) and \( l_2 \leq r_2 \)). If \( k \) falls within the overlapping interval, the end point of the interval is adjusted by decrementing it by one. Finally, the function returns the length of the overlapping interval, which can be zero if no overlap exists. Potential edge cases include when \( k \) is exactly at the boundary of the overlapping interval or when no overlap occurs.**
