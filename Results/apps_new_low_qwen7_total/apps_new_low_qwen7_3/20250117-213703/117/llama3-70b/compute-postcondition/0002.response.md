`end` is decremented by 1, which means its new value is `end - 1`. The other variables (`l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2`, `k`, `start`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l_1` is max(l1, l2), `r_1` is min(r1, r2), `l_2` is unchanged, `r_2` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `start` is less than or equal to `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `end - 1`**
