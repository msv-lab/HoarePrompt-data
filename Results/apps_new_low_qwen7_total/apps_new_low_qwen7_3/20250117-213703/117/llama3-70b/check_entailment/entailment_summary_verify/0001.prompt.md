You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Today an outstanding event is going to happen in the forest — hedgehog Filya will come to his old fried Sonya!

Sonya is an owl and she sleeps during the day and stay awake from minute l_1 to minute r_1 inclusive. Also, during the minute k she prinks and is unavailable for Filya.

Filya works a lot and he plans to visit Sonya from minute l_2 to minute r_2 inclusive.

Calculate the number of minutes they will be able to spend together.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integers l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 and k (1 ≤ l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, k ≤ 10^18, l_1 ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ r_2), providing the segments of time for Sonya and Filya and the moment of time when Sonya prinks.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of minutes Sonya and Filya will be able to spend together.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 10 9 20 1

Output
2

Input
1 100 50 200 75

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first sample, they will be together during minutes 9 and 10.

In the second sample, they will be together from minute 50 to minute 74 and from minute 76 to minute 100.

- Program:
def func():
    (l1, r1, l2, r2, k) = map(int, input().split())
    start = max(l1, l2)
    end = min(r1, r2)
    if start <= k <= end:
        end -= 1
    minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)
    print(minutes_together)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts five integer parameters \( l_1 \), \( r_1 \), \( l_2 \), \( r_2 \), and \( k \). It calculates the maximum number of minutes during which two intervals overlap, where the first interval is \([l_1, r_1]\) and the second interval is \([l_2, r_2]\). The function ensures that both intervals are valid (i.e., \( l_1 \leq r_1 \) and \( l_2 \leq r_2 \)). If \( k \) falls within the overlapping interval, the end point of the interval is adjusted by decrementing it by one. Finally, the function returns the length of the overlapping interval, which can be zero if no overlap exists. Potential edge cases include when \( k \) is exactly at the boundary of the overlapping interval or when no overlap occurs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step to ensure it correctly calculates the number of minutes Sonya and Filya can spend together.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads five integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, and `k` from the input.
2. **Finding Overlapping Interval**: 
   - `start = max(l1, l2)`: This ensures that we start considering the overlapping interval from the later of the two start times.
   - `end = min(r1, r2)`: This ensures that we consider the earlier of the two end times.
3. **Checking Prinking Moment**:
   - If `k` falls within the overlapping interval `[start, end]`, we need to subtract one minute because Sonya is prinking at that moment and cannot spend time with Filya.
4. **Calculating Together Time**:
   - `minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)`: This calculates the length of the overlapping interval. If there is no overlap (`end < start`), it returns `0`. Otherwise, it calculates the length of the overlap, adjusting for the prinking moment if necessary.

The logic of the code seems sound and handles all edge cases appropriately:
- If there is no overlap, the result will be `0`.
- If there is an overlap but `k` falls within the overlap, it correctly adjusts the overlap length by subtracting one minute.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly calculate the number of minutes Sonya and Filya can spend together based on the provided problem description.
