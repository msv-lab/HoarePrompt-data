### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the annotated code and the provided examples to ensure the program behaves as intended and handles all edge cases correctly.

1. **Input Handling and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the five integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, and `k` from the input.
   - `start` is initialized as the maximum of `l1` and `l2`, ensuring the start of the overlapping interval is the latest possible start time.
   - `end` is initialized as the minimum of `r1` and `r2`, ensuring the end of the overlapping interval is the earliest possible end time.

2. **Overlap Check and Adjustment**:
   - The program checks if `k` falls within the interval `[start, end]`.
   - If `k` is within this interval, `end` is decremented by 1. This adjustment is necessary because `k` is a prinking minute that should not be included in the overlapping time.

3. **Calculation of Overlapping Minutes**:
   - The program calculates the number of overlapping minutes using `max(0, end - start + 1)`, ensuring the result is non-negative even if there is no overlap.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there is no overlap (i.e., `start > end`), the program correctly returns 0.
   - If `k` is exactly at the boundary of the overlapping interval, the program correctly adjusts the end time and calculates the overlap.

Given the detailed analysis and the provided examples, the program appears to handle all cases correctly.

- In the first example, Sonya is available from minute 1 to minute 10, and Filya is available from minute 9 to minute 20. The prinking time is at minute 1, so no overlap is affected, and they are together for 2 minutes (9 and 10).
- In the second example, Sonya is available from minute 1 to minute 100, and Filya is available from minute 50 to minute 200. The prinking time is at minute 75, so the overlapping interval is from minute 75 to minute 100, resulting in 50 minutes of overlap.

The annotated code accurately reflects the state transitions and the logic applied by the program.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: True**

The program correctly calculates the number of minutes Sonya and Filya can spend together, handling all edge cases and input scenarios as expected.
