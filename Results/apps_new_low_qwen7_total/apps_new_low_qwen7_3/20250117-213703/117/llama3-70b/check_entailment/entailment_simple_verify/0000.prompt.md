You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Today an outstanding event is going to happen in the forest — hedgehog Filya will come to his old fried Sonya!

Sonya is an owl and she sleeps during the day and stay awake from minute l_1 to minute r_1 inclusive. Also, during the minute k she prinks and is unavailable for Filya.

Filya works a lot and he plans to visit Sonya from minute l_2 to minute r_2 inclusive.

Calculate the number of minutes they will be able to spend together.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integers l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 and k (1 ≤ l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, k ≤ 10^18, l_1 ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ r_2), providing the segments of time for Sonya and Filya and the moment of time when Sonya prinks.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of minutes Sonya and Filya will be able to spend together.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 10 9 20 1

Output
2

Input
1 100 50 200 75

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first sample, they will be together during minutes 9 and 10.

In the second sample, they will be together from minute 50 to minute 74 and from minute 76 to minute 100.

- Program: 
def func():
    (l1, r1, l2, r2, k) = map(int, input().split())
    start = max(l1, l2)
    end = min(r1, r2)
    if start <= k <= end:
        end -= 1
    minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)
    print(minutes_together)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, k ≤ 10^18, l_1 ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ r_2, and k is within the range [l_2, r_2].
def func():
    l1, r1, l2, r2, k = map(int, input().split())

start = max(l1, l2)

end = min(r1, r2)
    if (start <= k <= end) :
        end -= 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l_1` is max(l1, l2), `r_1` is min(r1, r2), `l_2` is unchanged, `r_2` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, and `start` is less than or equal to `k` which is less than or equal to `end - 1`
    minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)

print(minutes_together)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of minutes Sonya and Filya can spend together based on their availability times and the prinking time. 

- The program first determines the overlapping time period between Sonya's and Filya's availability using `max(l1, l2)` for the start time and `min(r1, r2)` for the end time.
- It then checks if the prinking time (`k`) falls within this overlap. If it does, the end time is adjusted by subtracting one to exclude the prinking minute.
- Finally, the program calculates the number of overlapping minutes, ensuring it does not go below zero.

Given the constraints and the logic used, the program handles all potential cases correctly, as demonstrated by the provided examples and the general logic applied.
