### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, and `k` by reading them from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This part is correct.
2. **Setting Start and End Times**: 
   - `start` is set to `max(l1, l2)`: This ensures that `start` is the earliest possible time both are awake.
   - `end` is set to `min(r1, r2)`: This ensures that `end` is the latest possible time both are awake.
3. **Checking Prinking Time**:
   - If `k` (the prinking time) is within the interval `[start, end]`, it means Sonya is busy at this time, so we need to subtract one minute from the total time together. Hence, `end -= 1`.
4. **Calculating Minutes Together**:
   - `minutes_together` is calculated as `max(0, end - start + 1)`: This accounts for the fact that the number of minutes together must be non-negative and handles the case where there might be no overlap.

The logic here correctly calculates the overlapping time between Filya and Sonyaâ€™s availability while accounting for the prinking time. Given the constraints and the logic, the annotated program accurately computes the required output.

### Correctness:
**True**

Therefore, the given program is correct.
