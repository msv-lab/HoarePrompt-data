### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step to ensure it correctly calculates the number of minutes Sonya and Filya can spend together.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads five integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, and `k` from the input.
2. **Finding Overlapping Interval**: 
   - `start = max(l1, l2)`: This ensures that we start considering the overlapping interval from the later of the two start times.
   - `end = min(r1, r2)`: This ensures that we consider the earlier of the two end times.
3. **Checking Prinking Moment**:
   - If `k` falls within the overlapping interval `[start, end]`, we need to subtract one minute because Sonya is prinking at that moment and cannot spend time with Filya.
4. **Calculating Together Time**:
   - `minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)`: This calculates the length of the overlapping interval. If there is no overlap (`end < start`), it returns `0`. Otherwise, it calculates the length of the overlap, adjusting for the prinking moment if necessary.

The logic of the code seems sound and handles all edge cases appropriately:
- If there is no overlap, the result will be `0`.
- If there is an overlap but `k` falls within the overlap, it correctly adjusts the overlap length by subtracting one minute.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly calculate the number of minutes Sonya and Filya can spend together based on the provided problem description.

**Correctness: True**
