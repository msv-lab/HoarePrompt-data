The function `func_2()` accepts two integer parameters `hh` and `mm`, representing hours and minutes respectively. It repeatedly decreases the minute value by `x` (an integer between 1 and 60) until the time `hh:mm` contains the digit '7'. For each iteration where the minute value decreases, the `snooze_count` is incremented. If the minute value becomes negative during the process, it wraps around to the next hour. Once the condition `func_1(hh, mm)` is met (i.e., the time contains the digit '7'), the function prints the total number of times the time was adjusted (`snooze_count`). The final state of the program includes updated values for `hh`, `mm`, and `snooze_count`. Potential edge cases include when `hh` or `mm` wrap around to the previous or next 24-hour cycle, respectively. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the `snooze_count` through the print statement.
