`hh` is incremented by 24. Since `hh` was initially 22, adding 24 to it results in `hh` being 46. The states of the other variables (`x`, `mm`, `snooze_count`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 5, `hh` is 46, `mm` is 18, `snooze_count` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is 5, `hh` is 46, `mm` is 18, `snooze_count` is 1**
