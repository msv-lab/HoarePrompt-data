The initial state is:
- `x` is an integer between 1 and 60
- `hh` is an integer between 0 and 23
- `mm` is an integer between 0 and 59 with the current value of `mm` being less than 0, which is not possible according to the given range. This implies there's an inconsistency, but we'll proceed assuming `mm` is a valid integer within [0, 59].
- `snooze_count` is 1
- `func_1(hh, mm)` must return False

The code block executes the following operations:
1. `mm += 60`: This increases `mm` by 60. Since `mm` is currently a valid integer between 0 and 59 (assuming it wrapped around or was adjusted to a valid time), adding 60 will make it roll over to the next hour's minutes.
2. `hh -= 1`: This decreases `hh` by 1. Since `hh` is initially between 0 and 23, decrementing it will decrease the hour count by one.

Given these operations, let's assume the exact values for demonstration:
Let's assume the initial values are:
- `x` = 5 (as a generic example within the range 1-60)
- `hh` = 23 (as a generic example within the range 0-23)
- `mm` = 58 (as a generic example, just below 59)
- `snooze_count` = 1

After executing the code:
1. `mm += 60` changes `mm` from 58 to 118. Since `mm` must be between 0 and 59, it wraps around to 58 - (60 - 58) = 58 - 2 = 58 - 2 + 60 = 18.
2. `hh -= 1` changes `hh` from 23 to 22.

The values of `x` and `snooze_count` remain unchanged since they are not modified by the code. Therefore, the final state is:
Output State: **x is 5, hh is 22, mm is 18, snooze_count is 1**
