Output State: **snooze_count is 3, mm is either mm - x or unchanged (if mm < 0), and hh is adjusted such that func_1(hh, mm) returns False**

Explanation:
- The first line `snooze_count += 1` increments `snooze_count` by 1, making it 3.
- The second line `mm -= x` attempts to decrement `mm` by the value of `x`. However, if `mm < 0`, then `mm` will remain unchanged. The exact value of `mm` after this operation depends on the initial value of `mm` and the value of `x`.

Given that `mm` is either `mm + 60` or unchanged (if `mm < 0`), we can infer that `mm` might have been set to a non-negative value previously. After `mm -= x`, `mm` could either be decreased by `x` or remain unchanged. However, regardless of whether `mm` changes or not, the condition `func_1(hh, mm)` must still return `False` after the second line executes. 

Since the initial state did not provide a specific value for `mm` and only indicated a potential adjustment, the final state reflects that `mm` could be either decreased by `x` or remain unchanged based on the condition `mm < 0`. The value of `hh` remains adjusted to ensure `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`.
