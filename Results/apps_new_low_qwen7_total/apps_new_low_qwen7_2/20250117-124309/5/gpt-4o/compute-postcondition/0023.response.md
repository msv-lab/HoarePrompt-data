The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `hh` and `mm`. Both `hh` and `mm` are integers. `hh` is between 0 and 23 inclusive, and `mm` is between 0 and 59 inclusive. The function returns `True` if the time represented by `hh:mm` contains the digit '7', and `False` otherwise.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `hh` and `mm`, and return `True` if the time represented by `hh:mm` contains the digit '7', and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `hh` and `mm`, returns `True` if the time represented by `hh:mm` contains the digit '7', and `False` otherwise.**
