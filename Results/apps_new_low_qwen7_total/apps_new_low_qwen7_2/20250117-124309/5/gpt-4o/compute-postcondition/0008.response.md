Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 60, `hh` is an integer between 0 and 23, `mm` is an integer between 0 and 59, `snooze_count` is 1. Since the condition `mm < 0` is false, the program follows the else part which does not alter the variables. Therefore, the values of `x`, `hh`, `mm`, and `snooze_count` remain unchanged.***
