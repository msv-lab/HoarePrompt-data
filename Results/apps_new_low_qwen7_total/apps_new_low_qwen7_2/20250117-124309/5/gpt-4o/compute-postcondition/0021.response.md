Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 60, `hh` is an integer between 0 and 23, `mm` is an integer between 0 and 59, `snooze_count` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1439 (since the maximum time in a day is 24 hours * 60 minutes = 1440 minutes).**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop continues until `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`.
   - In each iteration, `snooze_count` is incremented by 1.
   - `mm` is decremented by `x`.
   - If `mm` becomes negative, it is adjusted by adding 60 and decrementing `hh` by 1. If `hh` also becomes negative, it is adjusted by adding 24.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `snooze_count` increments with each iteration.
   - `mm` decreases by `x` in each iteration, wrapping around to the next hour if it goes below zero.
   - `hh` only changes if `mm` wraps around to the next hour and `hh` becomes negative.
   - `x`, `hh`, and `mm` are initially within specified ranges and may change based on the loop conditions but are constrained by the time limits (24 hours and 60 minutes).

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to run as long as `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`. Each iteration reduces `mm` by `x` and adjusts `hh` if necessary.
   - The loop can execute up to 1439 times because the total number of minutes in a day is 1440. After 1439 iterations, `mm` would be reduced to 0 and `hh` adjusted appropriately, but `func_1(hh, mm)` would still need to be checked.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationship between `snooze_count`, `mm`, and `hh` is consistent with the described behavior.
   - The maximum value of `snooze_count` is 1439, which occurs when `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True` only after all possible minutes in a day have been accounted for.
   - The minimum value of `snooze_count` is 0, which occurs if `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True` immediately without any iterations.

Thus, the final state after the loop finishes is determined by the number of iterations and the initial values of `hh` and `mm`, ensuring that the loop runs up to 1439 times in the worst case scenario.
