Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `not func_1(hh, mm)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `snooze_count` is 2.
   - `mm` is either `mm + 60` or unchanged (if `mm < 0`).
   - `hh` is adjusted as follows:
     - If `hh < 0`, then `hh` is set to `hh + 23`.
     - Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(hh, mm)` must return `False`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop depends on the values of `hh` and `mm`, these are the only states that need to be adjusted.

5. **Possible Adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False` when the loop is about to execute again.
   - Therefore, the states of `hh` and `mm` need to be such that `func_1(hh, mm)` evaluates to `False`.

### Conclusion

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the states of `hh` and `mm` so that `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`.

State: **`snooze_count` is 2, `mm` is either `mm + 60` or unchanged (if `mm < 0`), and `hh` is adjusted such that `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`**.
