The code `hh += 24` increments the value of `hh` by 24. The initial state shows that `snooze_count` is 2, `mm` is `mm + 60`, and `hh` is `hh - 1`. Since `mm` and `hh` are not given specific values in the initial state, we only know their relationships.

After executing the code, the new value of `hh` will be `(hh - 1) + 24`, which simplifies to `hh + 23`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`snooze_count` is 2, `mm` is `mm + 60`, `hh` is `hh + 23`**
