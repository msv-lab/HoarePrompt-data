The initial state is `snooze_count` is 2. However, the initial state also mentions `mm is mm - x`, which implies that `mm` is initially a value that is reduced by `x`. Since the exact value of `x` is not given, we can't determine the exact initial value of `mm`. But we know that it is reduced by `x` before the code block is executed. 

Let's analyze the code block:

1. `mm += 60`: This line increases the value of `mm` by 60.
2. `hh -= 1`: This line decreases the value of `hh` by 1.

Since no specific value for `hh` is given in the initial state, we can only say that it is decremented by 1. 

Combining these changes, we get the following:

- `snooze_count` remains 2 (unchanged).
- `mm` is increased by 60.
- `hh` is decreased by 1.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **snooze_count is 2, mm is mm + 60, hh is hh - 1**
