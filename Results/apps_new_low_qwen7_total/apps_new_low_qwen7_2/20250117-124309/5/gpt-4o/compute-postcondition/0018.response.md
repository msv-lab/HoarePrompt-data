`hh` is incremented by 24. The initial value of `snooze_count` is 3, and `mm` is either `mm + 60` or unchanged (if `mm < 0`). The value of `hh` is initially `hh - 1`. After incrementing `hh` by 24, the new value of `hh` is `hh - 1 + 24`, which simplifies to `hh + 23`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `snooze_count` is 3; `mm` is either `mm + 60` or unchanged (if `mm < 0`); `hh` is `hh + 23`.

Output State: **`snooze_count` is 3; `mm` is either `mm + 60` or unchanged (if `mm < 0`); `hh` is `hh + 23`**
