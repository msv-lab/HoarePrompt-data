The first line increments `snooze_count` by 1, making `snooze_count` equal to 1. The second line subtracts the value of `x` (which is an integer between 1 and 60) from `mm` (which is an integer between 0 and 59). This subtraction could potentially make `mm` negative if `x` is greater than `mm`.

Given that `mm` starts at a value between 0 and 59, and `x` is between 1 and 60, there is a possibility that `mm` could become negative. However, since `mm` represents minutes and cannot be negative, it will wrap around starting from 0 again once it goes below 0. Therefore, the effective new value of `mm` will be `59 - (x % 60)`.

Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 60, hh is an integer between 0 and 23, mm is an integer between 0 and 59, snooze_count is 1, func_1(hh, mm) must return False**
