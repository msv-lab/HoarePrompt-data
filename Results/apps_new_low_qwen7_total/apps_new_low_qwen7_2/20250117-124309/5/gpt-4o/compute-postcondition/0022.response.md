The code `print(snooze_count)` simply prints the value of `snooze_count` without changing its value. The other variables (`x`, `hh`, `mm`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the value of `snooze_count` printed.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 60, `hh` is an integer between 0 and 23, `mm` is an integer between 0 and 59, `snooze_count` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1439, the value of `snooze_count` is printed.**
