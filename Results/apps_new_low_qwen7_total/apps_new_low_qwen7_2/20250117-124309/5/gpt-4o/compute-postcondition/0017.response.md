Output State: **snooze_count is 3, mm is either mm + 60 or unchanged (if mm < 0), and hh is hh - 1**

Explanation:
- The first line `mm += 60` adds 60 to the value of `mm`. Since `mm` was either `-x` or `unchanged` (where `x` is a positive integer, typically in the context of time calculations), adding 60 to it modifies `mm` unless `mm` was already less than 0, in which case `mm` remains unchanged.
- The second line `hh -= 1` decreases the value of `hh` by 1. Given the initial condition that `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`, this implies that after decrementing `hh` by 1, the function still returns `False`.

Since the exact value of `mm` is not provided and depends on the initial condition (it could be `-x` or unchanged if it was less than 0), the final state reflects the operations performed on `mm` and `hh`, keeping the condition for `func_1` in mind.
