The given code snippet reads two inputs and initializes a variable `snooze_count` to 0. However, it does not perform any operations that modify the initial state of `x`, `hh`, or `mm`. The function `func_1(hh, mm)` is defined but not called within the provided code block. Therefore, the values of `x`, `hh`, and `mm` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer between 1 and 60 inclusive,
- `hh` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive,
- `mm` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive,
- `snooze_count` is initialized to 0.

The final output state is:
Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 60 inclusive, hh is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, mm is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, snooze_count is 0**
