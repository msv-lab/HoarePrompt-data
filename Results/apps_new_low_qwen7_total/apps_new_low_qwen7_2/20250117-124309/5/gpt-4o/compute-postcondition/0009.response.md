The variables in the loop head are `hh` and `mm`, so we can only adjust these two variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `not func_1(hh, mm)`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `func_1(hh, mm)` must return `False`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `x`, `hh`, `mm`, and `snooze_count` remain unchanged, meaning `hh` and `mm` still have their original values. For the loop to continue executing, `func_1(hh, mm)` must return `False`, implying that the current values of `hh` and `mm` do not satisfy the condition inside `func_1`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes again, we need to adjust the states such that `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`. However, since we don't know the exact condition inside `func_1`, we can only ensure that the loop can potentially execute again by keeping the variables as they are.

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 60, `hh` is an integer between 0 and 23, `mm` is an integer between 0 and 59, and `snooze_count` is 1. The condition `func_1(hh, mm)` must return False for the loop to execute again.**
