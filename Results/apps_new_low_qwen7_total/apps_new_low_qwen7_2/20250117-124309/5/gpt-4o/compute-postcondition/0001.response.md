Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `not func_1(hh, mm)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`.

2. **Understand the variables involved**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `hh` (hour) and `mm` (minute).

3. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `x` is an integer between 1 and 60 inclusive.
   - `hh` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive.
   - `mm` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive.
   - `snooze_count` is 0.

4. **Condition for loop execution**: For the loop to execute the first time, `func_1(hh, mm)` must return `False`. Since the function `func_1` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact behavior, but we know that the loop will continue until `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`.

5. **Adjusting the state**: To make the loop execute the first time, we need to ensure that `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`. Without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1`, we can only ensure that the loop can proceed based on the given constraints.

Given the constraints on `hh` and `mm`, we can assume that the initial values of `hh` and `mm` should be such that `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`. However, since no specific details about `func_1` are provided, we can only state the general requirement that `func_1(hh, mm)` must return `False`.

Since `snooze_count` is 0 and does not affect the loop condition directly, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the modified state right before the loop for the first iteration to occur is:

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 60 inclusive, `hh` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, `mm` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `snooze_count` is 0 and `func_1(hh, mm)` must return False.**
