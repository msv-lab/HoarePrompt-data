### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the solution step-by-step, and verify each part using the provided annotations.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Jamie needs to find the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button to reach a time that contains the digit '7'.
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if a given time contains the digit '7'.
   - The function `func_2` correctly implements the logic to find the nearest lucky time by repeatedly subtracting `x` minutes until a lucky time is found.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the current time contains the digit '7'.
   - The logic `return '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m)` is correct. It converts hours and minutes to strings and checks if either string contains '7'.
   - State: Before calling `func_1(hh, mm)`, `hh` is an integer between 0 and 23, and `mm` is an integer between 0 and 59.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - It initializes `snooze_count` to 0.
   - It uses a loop to check if the current time is lucky.
   - If the current time is not lucky, it increments the snooze count and adjusts the time by subtracting `x` minutes. If the minutes go below 0, it wraps around to the next hour.
   - The loop continues until a lucky time is found.
   - Finally, it prints the number of snoozes required.

   Let's analyze the loop in detail:
   ```python
   while not func_1(hh, mm):
       snooze_count += 1
       mm -= x
       if mm < 0:
           mm += 60
           hh -= 1
           if hh < 0:
               hh += 24
   ```
   - **Initialization**: `snooze_count` is initialized to 0.
   - **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`.
   - **Decrementing Time**: Each iteration of the loop decreases `mm` by `x` minutes.
   - **Wrapping Around**: If `mm` becomes negative, it wraps around to the next hour by adding 60 minutes to `mm` and decreasing `hh` by 1. If `hh` becomes negative, it wraps around to the next day by adding 24 hours to `hh`.

   The loop ensures that the time `hh:mm` eventually contains the digit '7'. The logic is sound because it keeps decrementing the time in steps of `x` minutes and handles the wrapping correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the edge case where the initial time already contains the digit '7'.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the time crosses over to the next day.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the nearest lucky time by repeatedly subtracting `x` minutes until a lucky time is found. The code handles all edge cases correctly and the annotations support the correctness of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
