### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks whether a given time (in the format `h:m`) contains the digit '7'.
   - It does this by converting both the hour (`h`) and minute (`m`) into strings and checking if '7' is present in either string.
   - This function is correctly implemented and serves its intended purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the main logic of the program.
   - It reads the snooze interval `x`, the target wake-up time `hh:mm`, and initializes the snooze count to 0.
   - It then enters a loop where it continuously subtracts `x` minutes from the current time (`hh:mm`) until the time contains the digit '7'.
   - If the minutes (`mm`) become negative during the subtraction, it correctly wraps around to the next hour and adjusts the hours accordingly.
   - The loop continues until `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`, indicating that the current time contains the digit '7'.
   - After exiting the loop, it prints the number of times the snooze button was pressed.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles all edge cases correctly, such as wrapping around the 24-hour clock and ensuring that the time remains within valid bounds.
   - The loop will terminate since the problem guarantees that there exists a lucky time, and the maximum number of iterations is limited by the total number of minutes in a day (1440 minutes).

4. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - The output is the correct number of times the snooze button needs to be pressed.

Given the above analysis, the provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button to reach a lucky time.

### Correctness: **True**
