### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the solution step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the smallest number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button so that the final alarm time (which is `hh:mm`) is a lucky time (contains the digit '7').
   - Jamie starts with an initial time and repeatedly subtracts `x` minutes until he reaches a lucky time.
   - If the current time is not lucky, we increment the snooze count and adjust the time by subtracting `x` minutes. If the minutes become negative, we wrap around to the next hour and adjust accordingly.

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the current time (`h:m`) contains the digit '7'.
     - The function converts hours and minutes to strings and checks if either string contains '7'.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - Reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
     - Initializes `snooze_count` to 0.
     - Uses a loop to keep checking if the current time is lucky.
     - If the current time is not lucky, it increments the snooze count and adjusts the time by subtracting `x` minutes. If the minutes go below 0, it wraps around to the next hour.
     - The loop continues until a lucky time is found.
     - Finally, it prints the number of snoozes required.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies lucky times.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the process of finding the nearest lucky time by decrementing the time in steps of `x` and counting the number of steps taken.
   - The code handles edge cases like crossing over to the next day correctly.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the logic required to find the smallest number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button to reach a lucky time.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed reasoning and the correctness of the implementation, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
