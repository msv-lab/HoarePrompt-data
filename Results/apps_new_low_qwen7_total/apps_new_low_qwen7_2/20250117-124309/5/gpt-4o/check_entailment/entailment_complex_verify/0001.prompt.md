You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jamie loves sleeping. One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly hh: mm. However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.

A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.

Note that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at hh: mm.

Formally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer y such that the time representation of the time x·y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'.

Jamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23: 59 comes 00: 00.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 60).

The second line contains two two-digit integers, hh and mm (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times he needs to press the button.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
11 23

Output
2

Input
5
01 07

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Jamie needs to wake up at 11:23. So, he can set his alarm at 11:17. He would press the snooze button when the alarm rings at 11:17 and at 11:20.

In the second sample, Jamie can set his alarm at exactly at 01:07 which is lucky.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(h, m):
    """Check if the time h:m contains a '7'."""
    return '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    x = int(input())
    (hh, mm) = map(int, input().split())
    snooze_count = 0
    while not func_1(hh, mm):
        snooze_count += 1
        mm -= x
        if mm < 0:
            mm += 60
            hh -= 1
            if hh < 0:
                hh += 24
    print(snooze_count)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: h is an integer representing hours (00 to 23), m is an integer representing minutes (00 to 59), and x is an integer representing the snooze interval (1 to 60).
def func_1(h, m):
    """Check if the time h:m contains a '7'."""
    return '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m)
    #The program returns True if either 'h' contains the digit 7 or 'm' contains the digit 7, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `h` and `m`, which represent hours (00 to 23) and minutes (00 to 59) respectively. It checks whether either `h` or `m` contains the digit 7. If either `h` or `m` contains the digit 7, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code since it correctly implements the described behavior.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer between 1 and 60 inclusive, hh is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, and mm is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive. The function func_1(hh, mm) returns True if the time represented by hh:mm contains the digit '7', and False otherwise.
def func_2():
    x = int(input())

hh, mm = map(int, input().split())

snooze_count = 0
    while not func_1(hh, mm):
        snooze_count += 1
        
        mm -= x
        
        if mm < 0:
            mm += 60
            hh -= 1
            if hh < 0:
                hh += 24
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is an integer between 1 and 60, `hh` is an integer between 0 and 23, `mm` is an integer between 0 and 59, `snooze_count` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1439 (since the maximum time in a day is 24 hours * 60 minutes = 1440 minutes).
    print(snooze_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` accepts two integer parameters `hh` and `mm`, representing hours and minutes respectively. It repeatedly decreases the minute value by `x` (an integer between 1 and 60) until the time `hh:mm` contains the digit '7'. For each iteration where the minute value decreases, the `snooze_count` is incremented. If the minute value becomes negative during the process, it wraps around to the next hour. Once the condition `func_1(hh, mm)` is met (i.e., the time contains the digit '7'), the function prints the total number of times the time was adjusted (`snooze_count`). The final state of the program includes updated values for `hh`, `mm`, and `snooze_count`. Potential edge cases include when `hh` or `mm` wrap around to the previous or next 24-hour cycle, respectively. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the `snooze_count` through the print statement.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the solution step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the smallest number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button so that the final alarm time (which is `hh:mm`) is a lucky time (contains the digit '7').
   - Jamie starts with an initial time and repeatedly subtracts `x` minutes until he reaches a lucky time.
   - If the current time is not lucky, we increment the snooze count and adjust the time by subtracting `x` minutes. If the minutes become negative, we wrap around to the next hour and adjust accordingly.

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the current time (`h:m`) contains the digit '7'.
     - The function converts hours and minutes to strings and checks if either string contains '7'.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - Reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
     - Initializes `snooze_count` to 0.
     - Uses a loop to keep checking if the current time is lucky.
     - If the current time is not lucky, it increments the snooze count and adjusts the time by subtracting `x` minutes. If the minutes go below 0, it wraps around to the next hour.
     - The loop continues until a lucky time is found.
     - Finally, it prints the number of snoozes required.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies lucky times.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the process of finding the nearest lucky time by decrementing the time in steps of `x` and counting the number of steps taken.
   - The code handles edge cases like crossing over to the next day correctly.

Based on this analysis, the provided solution correctly solves the problem as per the given constraints and requirements.
