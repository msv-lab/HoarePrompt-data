### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the digits `h` or `m` contain the digit '7'.
   - This function works correctly and accurately fulfills its intended purpose.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` takes three inputs: `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - It initializes `snooze_count` to 0 and enters a loop that decrements `mm` by `x` until the time `hh:mm` contains the digit '7'.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `mm` is less than 0. If so, it wraps around by adding 60 to `mm` and decrementing `hh` by 1. If `hh` also wraps around, it adds 24 to `hh`.
   - The loop continues until `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`, at which point it prints `snooze_count`.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function correctly handles the 24-hour clock format.
   - The loop terminates as soon as a lucky time is found, ensuring the minimum number of snoozes is counted.
   - The function accounts for both positive and negative minute adjustments, ensuring the loop progresses correctly.

4. **Behavior Validation Using Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` correctly identifies lucky times.
   - The main function `func_2` iterates correctly, decrementing the minutes by `x` and wrapping around as needed.
   - The loop termination condition ensures that the smallest number of snoozes is calculated.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of snoozes needed to reach a lucky time.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
