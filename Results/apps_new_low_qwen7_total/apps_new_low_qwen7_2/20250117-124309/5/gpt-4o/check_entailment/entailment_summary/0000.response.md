Reasoning:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` checks if a given time (represented by hours `h` and minutes `m`) contains the digit '7'.
- `func_2` calculates the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button to reach a lucky time from the target wake-up time. It uses `func_1` to check if the current time is lucky and adjusts the time accordingly.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly simulates the process of decrementing the minutes by `x` and wrapping around to the next hour if the minutes go below zero. It also correctly counts the number of snoozes required until a lucky time is reached.
- The provided examples demonstrate that `func_2` produces the expected output.
- There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem statement that are not handled by the functions, such as the target time being a lucky time itself, or the need to cross midnight or noon.

Given the analysis, the program's logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements and the provided execution summaries.

Correctness: **True**
