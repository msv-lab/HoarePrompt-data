Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button until the time contains a '7'. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` handle the checks and calculations as required. The outer loop ensures that the program keeps decrementing the minutes by `x` until a lucky time is found, adjusting for the 24-hour clock format. Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to handle all cases correctly without missing any edge cases.
