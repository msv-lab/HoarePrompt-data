### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and its components to ensure it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the current time contains the digit '7'.
   - The function works correctly by converting hours and minutes to strings and checking if either string contains '7'.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - It initializes `snooze_count` to 0.
   - It uses a loop to keep checking if the current time is lucky.
   - If the current time is not lucky, it increments the snooze count and adjusts the time by subtracting `x` minutes. If the minutes go below 0, it wraps around to the next hour.
   - The loop continues until a lucky time is found.
   - Finally, it prints the number of snoozes required.

Given the function summaries, the logic appears sound. Let's verify the implementation:

- **Initial State**:
  - `x` is read from input, ensuring the snooze interval is valid (1 to 60).
  - `hh` and `mm` are read from input, ensuring they are within valid ranges (00 to 23 for hours, 00 to 59 for minutes).

- **Loop Logic**:
  - The loop decrements `mm` by `x` until a lucky time is found.
  - If `mm` goes below 0, it correctly wraps around to the next hour.
  - The function `func_1` is used to check if the current time is lucky.
  - The loop stops once a lucky time is found, and the `snooze_count` is printed.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code correctly handles crossing over to the next day by adjusting `hh` when `mm` wraps around.
  - The code ensures that the final time is always checked against the digit '7' before printing the result.

### Verification:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Correctly checks if a time is lucky.
  
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Correctly implements the logic to find the smallest number of snoozes needed to reach a lucky time.
  - Handles all edge cases, including crossing over to the next day.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution and meets all the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
