### Reasoning:

Let's break down the code and verify its correctness against the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Jamie needs to wake up at a specific time \( \text{hh:mm} \).
- He sets the alarm at a lucky time (a time containing the digit '7').
- He presses the snooze button every \( x \) minutes until he reaches \( \text{hh:mm} \).
- The goal is to find the minimum number of times he needs to press the snooze button.

#### Function Summaries Recap:
1. `func_1(h, m)` checks if the time \( h:m \) contains the digit '7'.
2. `func_2()` reads the input, initializes variables, and iterates to find the lucky time using the `func_1` function, updating the snooze count and handling time adjustments.

#### Analysis:
1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - `func_2` reads the input values correctly and initializes the variables \( x \), \( \text{hh} \), and \( \text{mm} \).
   
2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop decrements the minutes by \( x \) each iteration.
   - If the minutes become negative, it wraps around to the next hour.
   - If the hours become negative, they wrap around to the previous 24-hour cycle.
   - The loop continues until the time \( \text{hh:mm} \) contains the digit '7'.
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if the current time contains the digit '7'.
   - The snooze count is incremented with each iteration of the loop.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the wrapping around of hours and minutes correctly.
   - The function `func_1` is applied appropriately to check the condition for each iteration.
   - The loop termination condition is correct as it stops when a lucky time is found.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct snooze count, which is the number of times the alarm was set to a non-lucky time before reaching the target time.

Given the detailed analysis, the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The provided function summaries also align well with the expected behavior of the code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it accurately finds the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button until the time contains the digit '7', and it handles all edge cases appropriately.
