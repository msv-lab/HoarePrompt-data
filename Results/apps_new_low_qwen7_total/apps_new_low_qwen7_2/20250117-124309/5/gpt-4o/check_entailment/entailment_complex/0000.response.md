Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(h, m)`**: This function correctly checks if a given time contains the digit '7'. It converts the hour `h` and minute `m` into strings and checks if '7' is present in either string. This function works correctly without any issues.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function starts by reading the integer `x` from the input.
   - It then reads the initial hour `hh` and minute `mm` from the input.
   - It initializes `snooze_count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of times the snooze button is pressed.
   - A while loop runs until the current time `hh:mm` contains the digit '7'.
     - Inside the loop, the snooze count is incremented.
     - The minute `mm` is decreased by `x`.
     - If `mm` becomes negative, it wraps around to the next hour by adding 60 to `mm` and decrementing `hh` by 1. If `hh` also becomes negative, it wraps around to the next day by adding 24 to `hh`.
   - Once the time contains the digit '7', the function prints the `snooze_count`.

The logic in `func_2()` appears to be sound. It correctly calculates the number of snoozes required to reach a lucky time. The loop ensures that the time wraps around correctly over days and hours.

Since both functions collectively meet the problem requirements and handle all edge cases properly, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
