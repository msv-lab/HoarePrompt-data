The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\)). It checks if the number of set bits in the binary representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is greater than `n`, it immediately returns 'No'. If the number of set bits is greater than `k`, it also returns 'No'. Otherwise, it modifies the list of set bits by appending duplicates of the smallest set bit until the list contains exactly `k` elements. Finally, it sorts the list in reverse order and returns 'Yes' followed by a space-separated string of these integers.
