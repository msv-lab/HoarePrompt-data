Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads input from standard input and separates the values into `n` and `k`.
2. **Initial Checks**: The program first checks if `k` is greater than `n`, in which case it returns 'No', as it's impossible to represent `n` with fewer bits than `n` itself.
3. **Bit Extraction**: The program extracts the positions of the set bits in `n` using bitwise operations and stores them in the `bits` list. This step is crucial for identifying which powers of 2 contribute to the sum.
4. **Validation**: The program checks if the number of set bits (`len(bits)`) is greater than `k`. If so, it returns 'No', as it would violate the requirement of having at most `k` integers.
5. **Modification to Meet Length Requirement**: If the number of set bits is less than `k`, the program appends duplicate copies of the smallest set bit to ensure the total count of elements in `bits` matches `k`.
6. **Sorting and Returning Result**: The list `bits` is sorted in reverse order to make it lexicographically largest among all possible configurations with the same maximum value. The result is then returned in the required format.

Given the problem constraints and the steps outlined above, the provided implementation meets the requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately.
