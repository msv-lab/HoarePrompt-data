Reasoning:

1. The program reads input from standard input, which is correctly done using `sys.stdin.read`.
2. It then processes the input to extract `n` and `k`.
3. The function `func_1` is defined to check if it's possible to find `k` integers whose sum of powers of 2 equals `n`.
4. Inside `func_1`, it first checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it immediately returns 'No'.
5. It then constructs the list `bits` which contains the exponents of 2 that add up to `n`. This is done by iterating over possible exponents from 60 down to 0 and checking if `n` is divisible by \(2^i\).
6. If the number of bits found exceeds `k`, it returns 'No', as we cannot form a sequence of length `k`.
7. If fewer than `k` bits are found, it tries to extend the sequence by adding smaller exponents, specifically by converting a higher exponent into two smaller ones.
8. Finally, it sorts the resulting sequence in reverse order to ensure it is lexicographically largest and returns the result.

The logic implemented in the program seems to correctly handle the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
