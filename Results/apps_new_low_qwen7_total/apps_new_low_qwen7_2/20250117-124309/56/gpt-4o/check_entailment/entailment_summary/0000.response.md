Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding \(k\) integers such that their sum of powers of 2 equals \(n\) and the largest integer in the answer is minimized. Additionally, among all such sequences, the lexicographically largest one should be returned.
2. The provided program reads input from standard input and calls `func_1(n, k)` to process the input and produce the desired output.
3. In `func_1`:
   - It first checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it returns 'No', which is correct because it's impossible to express \(n\) using fewer than \(n\) powers of 2.
   - It then determines the set bits in the binary representation of `n` by iterating from 60 down to 0. This ensures that the most significant bits are considered first.
   - If the number of set bits exceeds `k`, it returns 'No', again correctly handling cases where \(k\) cannot accommodate all set bits.
   - If there are enough set bits, it appends the smallest set bit twice for every additional element needed to reach `k`. This is done to ensure the sequence is lexicographically largest.
   - Finally, it sorts the resulting list in reverse order to maximize the values, ensuring the lexicographical order is maintained.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
