### Reasoning

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it to extract `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct.
   - It then constructs the list `bits` which contains the exponents of 2 that add up to `n`. This is done by iterating over possible exponents from 60 down to 0 and checking if `n` is divisible by \(2^i\). This part ensures that the sum of the powers of 2 matches `n`.
   - If the number of bits found exceeds `k`, it returns 'No', which is correct because the sequence would exceed the required length.
   - If fewer than `k` bits are found, it tries to extend the sequence by converting a higher exponent into two smaller ones. Specifically, it pops the smallest exponent from the list and appends `smallest - 1` twice. This ensures that the total number of elements in `bits` is exactly `k`.
   - Finally, it sorts the resulting sequence in reverse order to ensure it is lexicographically largest and returns the result.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the number of set bits in the binary representation of `n` is exactly `k` and when `k` is greater than `n`.

4. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The sorting step ensures that the sequence is lexicographically largest. By sorting in reverse order, the highest exponents come first, ensuring that the sequence is the lexicographically largest among all valid sequences.

5. **Guarantees**:
   - The problem guarantees that the integers in the answer sequence will fit within the range \([-10^{18}, 10^{18}]\), which is ensured by the way the exponents are handled.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest sequence of length `k` whose sum of powers of 2 equals `n`.
