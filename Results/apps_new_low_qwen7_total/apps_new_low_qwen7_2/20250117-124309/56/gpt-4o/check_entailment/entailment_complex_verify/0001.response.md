### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it correctly.
   - It initializes `n` and `k` from the input data.

2. **Function Definition and Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if `k` is greater than `n` and returns 'No' if it is, which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - The function then iterates over possible exponents from 60 down to 0 to find the set bits in `n`'s binary representation.
   - The list `bits` is constructed to contain the indices of the set bits.
   - If the number of set bits (`len(bits)`) exceeds `k`, the function returns 'No', which is correct.
   - If fewer than `k` set bits are found, the function attempts to extend the sequence by appending smaller exponents. Specifically, it pops the smallest set bit, appends the next lower exponent twice, and continues this process until the list contains exactly `k` elements.
   - Finally, the list is sorted in reverse order and returned, ensuring it is lexicographically largest.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `k` is greater than `n` correctly.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the number of set bits in `n` is greater than `k`.
   - For the case where the number of set bits is less than `k`, it extends the sequence correctly by appending smaller exponents, ensuring the sequence is lexicographically largest.

4. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The sorting step ensures that the sequence is in reverse order, which is necessary to make it lexicographically largest.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` correctly checks the conditions and generates the required sequence.
