The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\). The function returns either 'No' or 'Yes\n' followed by a space-separated string of integers contained in the list 'bits'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, and based on certain conditions, return either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a specific list of integers.
