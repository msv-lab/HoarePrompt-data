Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\)). It checks if the number of set bits in the binary representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is greater than `n`, it immediately returns 'No'. If the number of set bits is greater than `k`, it also returns 'No'. Otherwise, it modifies the list of set bits by appending duplicates of the smallest set bit until the list contains exactly `k` elements. Finally, it sorts the list in reverse order and returns 'Yes' followed by a space-separated string of these integers.**

**Edge Cases:**
1. If `n` is 0, the function will return 'No' because there are no set bits.
2. If `k` is greater than the number of set bits in `n`, the function will return 'No'.
3. If `k` is equal to the number of set bits in `n`, the function will return 'Yes' followed by the list of set bits.

**Missing Functionality:**
The code does not handle the case where `n` is 1 and `k` is 1 explicitly. In this case, the function should return 'Yes' followed by the single set bit (which is 0), but the current implementation may not cover this scenario properly.
