`bits` is sorted in reverse order. The original `bits` list contains unique indices of set bits in `n` except for the last two elements which are repeated. Sorting `bits` in reverse order means that the largest elements come first.

Let's denote the initial state of `bits` as `[b1, b2, ..., bk-2, bk-1, bk-1]` where `b1, b2, ..., bk-2` are unique indices and `bk-1` is repeated.

After sorting in reverse order, the new state of `bits` will be `[max(b1, b2, ..., bk-2), ..., min(b1, b2, ..., bk-2), bk-1, bk-1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and `k` ≤ `n`, `bits` is a list containing exactly `k` elements where the first `len(bits) - 2` elements are unique indices of set bits in `n`, sorted in reverse order, and the last two elements are the same and equal to the previous second-to-last element in `bits`.**
