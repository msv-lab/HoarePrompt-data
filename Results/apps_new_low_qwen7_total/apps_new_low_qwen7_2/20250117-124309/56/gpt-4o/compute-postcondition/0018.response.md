To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the given initial states.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while len(bits) < k:
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the length of the `bits` list is less than `k`.

Given the initial states:
- `i` is -1 (this variable does not affect the loop condition)
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) (this variable does not directly affect the loop condition but may influence the content of `bits`)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\) (this variable determines the target length of the `bits` list)
- `bits` is a list containing all indices `i` from 60 down to the highest set bit of `n`, and the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k` (this is the key list that controls the loop condition)

For the loop to execute the first time, the length of `bits` must be less than `k`. Since the length of `bits` is initially less than or equal to `k`, we need to ensure that it is strictly less than `k` for the loop to start.

Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute the first time is:
- The length of `bits` must be less than `k`.

State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing all indices `i` from 60 down to the highest set bit of `n`, and the length of `bits` is less than `k`**
