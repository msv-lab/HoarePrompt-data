You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and k is less than or equal to n
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is -1, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing all indices `i` from 60 down to the highest set bit of `n`. The loop continues to decrement `i` from 60 to 0, appending each index where the corresponding bit of `n` is set (i.e., `n >> i & 1` evaluates to 1). Once `i` reaches -1, the loop terminates because the condition `i in range(60, -1, -1)` no longer holds true.
    #
    #Since the loop runs from 60 down to 0, it will continue to append indices to `bits` as long as the corresponding bits in `n` are set to 1. After the loop completes, `i` will be -1, indicating that all possible bits have been checked. The value of `n` remains unchanged unless the problem statement specifies otherwise, but since no operations are performed on `n` other than reading its bits, `n` remains the same. The variable `k` is not affected by the loop and remains within its initial bounds.
    if (len(bits) > k) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` is -1, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing all indices `i` from 60 down to the highest set bit of `n`, and the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: i is -1, n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and k ≤ n, bits is a list containing exactly k elements where the first len(bits) - 2 elements are unique indices of set bits in n, and the last two elements are the same and equal to the previous second-to-last element in bits.
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
    #'Yes\n' followed by a space-separated string of integers contained in the list 'bits'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\). The function returns either 'No' or 'Yes\n' followed by a space-separated string of integers contained in the list 'bits'. 
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, and based on certain conditions, return either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a specific list of integers.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'No'

Case_2: The program returns 'No'

Case_3: 'Yes\n' followed by a space-separated string of integers contained in the list 'bits'


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
