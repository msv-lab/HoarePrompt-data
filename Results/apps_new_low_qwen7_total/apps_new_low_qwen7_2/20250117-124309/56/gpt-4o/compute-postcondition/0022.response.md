Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `len(bits) < k`.
2. **Determine the current state of the loop head variables**:
   - `bits` is a list containing the indices of all the bits that are set in `n` followed by the next-to-last bit index twice.
   - We need `len(bits)` to be less than `k` for the loop to continue.

3. **Check the current length of `bits`**:
   - Since the loop just finished one iteration, the length of `bits` has increased by some amount. Letâ€™s denote the current length of `bits` as `len(bits_current)`.

4. **Determine the required state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `len(bits)` must be less than `k`.
   - Therefore, `len(bits_current) + 1` must be less than `k`.

Since the loop just ended, `len(bits_current)` is already known, but for the loop to continue, `len(bits)` needs to be incremented by 1. Hence, the requirement is:

\[ \text{len}(bits) = \text{len}(bits_current) + 1 < k \]

This means that `len(bits)` should be less than `k` after adding 1 to the current length.

**Adjusting the states**:
- The state of `bits` itself doesn't change; it just needs to be in a position where its length is less than `k` after the next iteration.
- However, we need to ensure that `len(bits)` is indeed less than `k` before the next iteration starts.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:
- Ensure that `len(bits)` is less than `k` after the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `i` is -1 (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\) (relevant as it controls the loop).
- `bits` is a list containing the indices of all the bits that are set in `n` followed by the next-to-last bit index twice (not directly relevant to the loop condition).

We need to ensure that the condition `len(bits) < k` holds true before the next iteration starts.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is unknown, `i` is -1, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` must be greater than `len(bits) + 1`, and `bits` is a list containing the indices of all the bits that are set in `n` followed by the next-to-last bit index twice**
