The code initializes an empty list named `bits`. The variables `n` and `k` retain their initial values from the precondition. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `bits` list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and k is less than or equal to n; `bits` is an empty list**
