`bits.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 58) to the list `bits`. No other changes occur to the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, or `bits`. Therefore, `bits` will now contain the value 58.

Output State: **`i` is 58, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing [58]**
