Output State: **total is unknown, i is -1, n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k must be greater than len(bits) + 1, bits is a list where the last two elements are the same, which is smallest - 1, and smallest is the previous second-to-last element in bits**

Explanation:
- The code modifies the `bits` list by popping the last element (`smallest`), then appending `smallest - 1` twice.
- This operation affects the `bits` list, changing its structure as described. The `total`, `i`, `n`, and `k` variables remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.
