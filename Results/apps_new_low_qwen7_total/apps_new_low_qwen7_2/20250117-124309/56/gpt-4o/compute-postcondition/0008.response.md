Let's analyze the given state and the loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 60
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\)
- `bits` is a list

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs from `i = 60` down to `i = 0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

### Current Value of `i`:
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 60.

### Loop Execution:
For the loop to continue executing, the condition `i >= 0` must hold true. Since the loop starts from 60 and decrements by 1 each time, it will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

### Adjusting the State:
Since `i` is currently 60, we need to decrement `i` by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will become 59.

### Checking Other Variables:
- `n`: No change needed as it does not depend on the loop variable `i`.
- `k`: No change needed as it does not depend on the loop variable `i`.
- `bits`: No change needed as it does not depend on the loop variable `i`.

### Updated State:
- `i` becomes 59.
- `n` remains the same: a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` remains the same: a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\).
- `bits` remains the same: either `[60]` if `n >> 60 & 1` is true, or an empty list otherwise.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 59, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list**.
