Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the range defined by `range(60, -1, -1)`.

2. **Understand the Range Function**: The `range(60, -1, -1)` function generates numbers starting from 60 and decrementing by 1 until it reaches -1. The first value generated by this range function is 60.

3. **Determine the Initial Condition for `i`**: For the loop to execute its first iteration, `i` must be equal to the first value generated by the range function, which is 60.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables mentioned in the problem statement (`n`, `k`, and `bits`) are not directly involved in the loop condition. They do not affect whether the loop can execute the first time. Therefore, they remain as stated in the initial conditions.

Given the above points, we can conclude that for the loop to execute the first time, the value of `i` must be 60.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 60, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and k is less than or equal to n, `bits` is an empty list**
