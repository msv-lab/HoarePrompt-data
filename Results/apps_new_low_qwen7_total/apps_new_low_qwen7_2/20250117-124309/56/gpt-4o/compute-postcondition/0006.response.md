The code appends the value of `i` to the list `bits`. Given that `i` is 60, `bits` will become `[60]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 60, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and k is less than or equal to n, `bits` is a list containing [60].**
