Output State: **i is -1, n is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), k is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), bits is a list containing the indices of all the bits that are set in `n` followed by `smallest - 1` twice, where `smallest` is the smallest index in the `bits` list before popping**.

Explanation:
1. The first line `smallest = bits.pop()` pops the last element of the `bits` list and assigns it to `smallest`. Let's denote the original `bits` list as `[b1, b2, ..., bk]` where `b1` is the smallest index.
2. The second line `bits.append(smallest - 1)` appends `smallest - 1` to the `bits` list.
3. The third line `bits.append(smallest - 1)` appends another `smallest - 1` to the `bits` list.

After executing these lines, the `bits` list will contain the original elements plus two additional elements which are `smallest - 1`. Therefore, the final state of the `bits` list will be `[b1, b2, ..., bk, smallest - 1, smallest - 1]`, where `smallest` is the smallest index in the original `bits` list before popping. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
