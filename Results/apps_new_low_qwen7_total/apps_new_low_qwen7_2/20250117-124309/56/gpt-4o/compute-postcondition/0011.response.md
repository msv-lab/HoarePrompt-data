Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` in the range from 60 to -1 with a step of -1. Therefore, the only variable involved in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 59.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to -1. Since `i` is currently 59, it is certainly greater than -1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: In the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 58.

Given this analysis, we can now state the modified program state for the start of the next iteration of the loop.

**State: **`i` is 58, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list. If \(n \gg i \& 1\) is true, then the 59th bit of `n` is 1. Otherwise, no change in the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `bits` occurs.**
