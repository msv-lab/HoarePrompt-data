Postcondition: ***`i` is 59, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list. If \(n \gg i \& 1\) is true, then the 59th bit of `n` is 1. Otherwise, no change in the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `bits` occurs.***
