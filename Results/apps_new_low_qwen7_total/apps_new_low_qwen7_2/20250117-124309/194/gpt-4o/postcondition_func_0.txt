The function `func_1` accepts a 2x2 degenerate matrix `A` and returns either 0.0 or `min_norm_value`. If the determinant of the matrix `A` is 0, it returns 0.0 immediately. Otherwise, it calculates `min_norm_value` based on the following conditions:
1. If the absolute value of `a` is the largest among `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, it computes `a_prime` as `b * c / d` if `d` is not zero, otherwise 0. It then sets `min_norm_value` to the absolute difference between `a` and `a_prime`.
2. If the absolute value of `b` is the largest, it computes `b_prime` as `a * d / c` if `c` is not zero, otherwise 0. It then sets `min_norm_value` to the absolute difference between `b` and `b_prime`.
3. If the absolute value of `c` is the largest, it computes `c_prime` as `a * d / b` if `b` is not zero, otherwise 0. It then sets `min_norm_value` to the absolute difference between `c` and `c_prime`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it computes `d_prime` as `b * c / a` if `a` is not zero, otherwise 0. It then sets `min_norm_value` to the absolute difference between `d` and `d_prime`.

In all cases, the function returns the calculated `min_norm_value`. This value represents the smallest possible norm (difference) between the original elements and their adjusted counterparts, subject to the conditions specified.
