The provided code snippet reads four integers from input, splits them into pairs to form a 2x2 matrix `A`, and then calls a function `func_1(A)`. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the snippet, so we cannot determine its exact behavior. Given this, we can only describe the state of the variables after the input and matrix formation, and acknowledge the call to an unknown function.

Let's break it down:

1. Four integers are read from input and split into pairs to form the matrix `A`.
2. The matrix `A` is formed with elements `[a, b]` and `[c, d]`.
3. The function `func_1` is called with `A` as its argument.
4. The result of `func_1(A)` is printed with 10 decimal places.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` post-execution, nor the exact result of the function call. However, we know the matrix `A` is correctly formed with the input values, and the function is called.

Given the initial conditions and the operations performed, the final state is:

Output State: **a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, A is a 2x2 matrix with elements [a, b] and [c, d], result is the return value of func_1(A) (an unknown value)**
