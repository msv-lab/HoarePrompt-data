The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The matrix A is given as a 2x2 matrix with elements a, b, c, and d, where a, b, c, and d are integers such that |a|, |b|, |c|, |d| ≤ 10^9. However, since no specific operation or return value is provided, we can only describe the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and deals with a 2x2 matrix A with elements a, b, c, and d, where a, b, c, and d are integers such that |a|, |b|, |c|, |d| ≤ 10^9.**
