Output State: **a is a number, b is a number, c is a number, d is a number, det is 0.0, d_prime is b * c / a if a != 0 else 0, min_norm_value is abs(d - d_prime)**

Explanation:
- The initial values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `det` remain unchanged.
- The line `d_prime = b * c / a if a != 0 else 0` calculates `d_prime` based on the value of `a`. If `a` is not zero, `d_prime` is calculated as `b * c / a`. Otherwise, `d_prime` is set to 0.
- The line `min_norm_value = abs(d - d_prime)` computes the absolute difference between `d` and `d_prime`.
- The precondition ensures that the absolute values of `b`, `c`, and `d` are less than or equal to the absolute value of `a`, and the absolute value of `c` is less than the maximum of the absolute values of `a`, `b`, and `d`. These conditions do not change during the execution of the code.
