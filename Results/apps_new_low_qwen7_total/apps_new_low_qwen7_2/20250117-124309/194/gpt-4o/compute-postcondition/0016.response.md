Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `det`, `a_prime`, `b_prime`, `c_prime`, and `d_prime` are numbers. If the absolute value of `a` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `b`, `c`, and `d`, then `a_prime` is `b * c / d` if `d` is not zero, otherwise `0`, and `min_norm_value` is `abs(a - a_prime)`. If the absolute value of `b` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `a`, `c`, and `d`, then `min_norm_value` is `abs(b) - (0.0 if det == 0.0 else a * b_prime)`, where `b_prime` is adjusted such that the absolute value of `b` remains greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `a`, `c`, and `d`. If the absolute value of `c` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `a`, `b`, and `d`, then `c_prime` is `a * d / b` if `b` is not zero, otherwise `0`, and `min_norm_value` is `abs(c) - c_prime`. If none of the above conditions are met, then `d_prime` is `b * c / a` if `a` is not zero, otherwise `0`, and `min_norm_value` is `abs(d) - d_prime`.***
