Output State: **a is a number, b is b, c is c, d is d, det is 0.0, min_norm_value is abs(b - b_prime), the absolute value of b, c, and d is greater than the absolute value of a, and the absolute value of b is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of a, c, and d**

Explanation:
- The first line of the code calculates `b_prime` using the formula `a * d / c` if `c` is not zero; otherwise, it sets `b_prime` to 0. Given the initial conditions, `b_prime` is calculated as `a * d / c`.
- The second line calculates `min_norm_value` as the absolute difference between `b` and `b_prime`, i.e., `abs(b - b_prime)`.

Since `b_prime` is determined based on the initial values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and no other variables are affected by this code, the output state includes the new value for `min_norm_value` along with the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `det`, and the conditions specified in the precondition.
