Output State: **a is a number, b is a number, c is a number, d is a number, det is 0.0, c_prime is a number calculated as a * d / b if b is not zero, otherwise 0, min_norm_value is a number calculated as the absolute value of c minus c_prime**

Explanation:
1. The first line calculates `c_prime` based on the formula `a * d / b` if `b` is not zero; otherwise, it sets `c_prime` to 0. This means `c_prime` is directly derived from the values of `a`, `d`, and `b`.
2. The second line calculates `min_norm_value` as the absolute difference between `c` and `c_prime`. 

Given the conditions from the initial state, no further simplification can be made without specific numerical values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Therefore, the output state reflects the derived values for `c_prime` and `min_norm_value` based on the input values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
