Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `det`, `c_prime`, and `d_prime` are numbers. If the absolute value of `c` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `a`, `b`, and `d`, then `c_prime` is calculated as `a * d / b` if `b` is not zero, otherwise `0`, and `min_norm_value` is the absolute value of `c` minus `c_prime`. Otherwise, `d_prime` is calculated as `b * c / a` if `a` is not zero, otherwise `0`, and `min_norm_value` is the absolute value of `d` minus `d_prime`.***
