The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `A`, which is a 2x2 matrix represented as a list of lists or a list of tuples. The elements of the matrix \(A = \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right)\) are floating-point numbers such that \(|a|, |b|, |c|, |d| \leq 10^9\) and the matrix is degenerate (i.e., \(\operatorname{det}(A) = ad - bc = 0\)).

The function returns either 0.0 or `min_norm_value`, which is calculated based on the given conditions involving the absolute values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and their respective prime values and adjustments.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a 2x2 degenerate matrix `A` and return either 0.0 or `min_norm_value` based on the specified conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `A`, a 2x2 degenerate matrix, and returns 0.0 or `min_norm_value` based on the specified conditions involving the absolute values of its elements and their respective prime values and adjustments.**
