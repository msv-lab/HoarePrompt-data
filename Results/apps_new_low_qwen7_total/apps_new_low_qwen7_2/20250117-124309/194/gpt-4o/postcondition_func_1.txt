The function reads four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) from the input, constructs a 2x2 matrix \(A\) using these integers, calls another function `func_1` with matrix \(A\) as input, and then prints the result of `func_1` rounded to 10 decimal places. The function does not accept any parameters and its primary action is to transform the input integers into a matrix and process it through `func_1`. Potential edge cases include the possibility of invalid input (e.g., non-integer values or more than four input values). If the input is invalid, the function may raise an exception. Additionally, the function assumes that the input is always in the correct format; otherwise, it will fail when attempting to split the input string.
