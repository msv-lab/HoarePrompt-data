You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The determinant of a matrix 2 × 2 is defined as follows:$\operatorname{det} \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right) = a d - b c$

A matrix is called degenerate if its determinant is equal to zero. 

The norm ||A|| of a matrix A is defined as a maximum of absolute values of its elements.

You are given a matrix $A = \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right)$. Consider any degenerate matrix B such that norm ||A - B|| is minimum possible. Determine ||A - B||.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers a and b (|a|, |b| ≤ 10^9), the elements of the first row of matrix A. 

The second line contains two integers c and d (|c|, |d| ≤ 10^9) the elements of the second row of matrix A.


-----Output-----

Output a single real number, the minimum possible value of ||A - B||. Your answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2
3 4

Output
0.2000000000

Input

0 1

-----Note-----

In the second sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{0.5} & {0.5} \\{0.5} & {0.5} \end{array} \right)$

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the given function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum possible norm ||A - B|| for a degenerate matrix B, and that `func_2` properly reads the input and prints the output with the required precision.

1. **Determining the Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function aims to find the minimum possible norm of the difference between matrix A and a degenerate matrix B.
   - A degenerate matrix B has a determinant of zero. For a 2x2 matrix, this means \(ad - bc = 0\).
   - If the determinant of A is already zero, it returns 0.0 immediately, which is correct.
   - Otherwise, it computes the value of each element in B such that the determinant becomes zero and compares the absolute differences.

2. **Key Steps in `func_1`:**
   - Compute the determinant of A.
   - If the determinant is not zero, adjust one of the elements to make the determinant zero while minimizing the change in the norm.
   - Adjustments are made by setting each element to its corresponding 'prime' value derived from making the determinant zero.
   - The function returns the minimum absolute difference found.

3. **Testing with Examples:**
   - For the first example, the original matrix A is \(\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4\end{array}\right)\). The determinant is \(1*4 - 2*3 = -2\). To make it zero, adjust \(a\) or \(d\) accordingly, resulting in a minimum norm of 0.2.
   - For the second example, the original matrix A is \(\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)\). The determinant is \(1*1 - 0*0 = 1\). To make it zero, adjust \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), or \(d\) to their prime values, resulting in a minimum norm of 0.5.

4. **Checking `func_2`:**
   - This function correctly parses the input and constructs the matrix A.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the result and prints it with the required precision.

Given the logical steps and examples, both functions appear to be correctly implemented and should produce the correct output based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
