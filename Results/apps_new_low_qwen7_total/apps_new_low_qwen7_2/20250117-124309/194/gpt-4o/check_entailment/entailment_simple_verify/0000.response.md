### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine the correctness of the solution.

#### Key Points in the Problem:
1. **Matrix Determinant**: The determinant of a 2x2 matrix \( A = \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right) \) is defined as \( \operatorname{det}(A) = ad - bc \).
2. **Degenerate Matrix**: A matrix is degenerate if its determinant is zero.
3. **Norm Calculation**: The norm \( ||A - B|| \) is the maximum of the absolute values of the elements of the matrix \( A - B \).

The goal is to find a degenerate matrix \( B \) such that the norm \( ||A - B|| \) is minimized. The provided code only handles the case where the determinant is exactly zero and directly returns 0.0. However, the problem statement requires handling cases where the determinant is close to zero but not exactly zero.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly checks if the determinant is zero and returns 0.0 if true.
   - If the determinant is non-zero, it tries to find the minimum norm by adjusting one of the elements to make the determinant zero. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the resulting matrix \( B \) will have the smallest possible norm.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads the input and constructs the matrix \( A \).
   - Calls `func_1` to compute the minimum norm.
   - Prints the result with appropriate formatting.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Handling of Non-Zero Determinants**: The function `func_1` attempts to adjust one element to make the determinant zero but does not ensure that the resulting matrix \( B \) has the smallest possible norm. For instance, consider the matrix \( A = \left(\begin{array}{ll}{1} & {2} \\{2} & {4} \end{array} \right) \). The determinant is zero, and the function returns 0.0. However, the actual minimum norm can be smaller by slightly adjusting the elements to make the determinant zero.

#### Correct Approach:
- To find the minimum norm, we need to adjust the elements of the matrix such that the determinant is zero and the norm is minimized. This involves finding the closest values to the original elements that make the determinant zero.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not handle the case where the determinant is close to zero but not exactly zero. The original assessment was accurate in identifying this issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum possible norm for a degenerate matrix \( B \) that minimizes \( ||A - B|| \).
