Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the given function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum possible norm ||A - B|| for a degenerate matrix B, and that `func_2` properly reads the input and prints the output with the required precision.

1. **Determining the Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function aims to find the minimum possible norm of the difference between matrix A and a degenerate matrix B.
   - A degenerate matrix B has a determinant of zero. For a 2x2 matrix, this means \(ad - bc = 0\).
   - If the determinant of A is already zero, it returns 0.0 immediately, which is correct.
   - Otherwise, it computes the value of each element in B such that the determinant becomes zero and compares the absolute differences.

2. **Key Steps in `func_1`:**
   - Compute the determinant of A.
   - If the determinant is not zero, adjust one of the elements to make the determinant zero while minimizing the change in the norm.
   - Adjustments are made by setting each element to its corresponding 'prime' value derived from making the determinant zero.
   - The function returns the minimum absolute difference found.

3. **Testing with Examples:**
   - For the first example, the original matrix A is \(\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4\end{array}\right)\). The determinant is \(1*4 - 2*3 = -2\). To make it zero, adjust \(a\) or \(d\) accordingly, resulting in a minimum norm of 0.2.
   - For the second example, the original matrix A is \(\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)\). The determinant is \(1*1 - 0*0 = 1\). To make it zero, adjust \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), or \(d\) to their prime values, resulting in a minimum norm of 0.5.

4. **Checking `func_2`:**
   - This function correctly parses the input and constructs the matrix A.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the result and prints it with the required precision.

Given the logical steps and examples, both functions appear to be correctly implemented and should produce the correct output based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
