You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The determinant of a matrix 2 × 2 is defined as follows:$\operatorname{det} \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right) = a d - b c$

A matrix is called degenerate if its determinant is equal to zero. 

The norm ||A|| of a matrix A is defined as a maximum of absolute values of its elements.

You are given a matrix $A = \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right)$. Consider any degenerate matrix B such that norm ||A - B|| is minimum possible. Determine ||A - B||.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers a and b (|a|, |b| ≤ 10^9), the elements of the first row of matrix A. 

The second line contains two integers c and d (|c|, |d| ≤ 10^9) the elements of the second row of matrix A.


-----Output-----

Output a single real number, the minimum possible value of ||A - B||. Your answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2
3 4

Output
0.2000000000

Input
1 0
0 1

Output
0.5000000000



-----Note-----

In the first sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{1.2} & {1.8} \\{2.8} & {4.2} \end{array} \right)$

In the second sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{0.5} & {0.5} \\{0.5} & {0.5} \end{array} \right)$

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(A):
    (a, b, c, d) = (A[0][0], A[0][1], A[1][0], A[1][1])
    det = a * d - b * c
    if det == 0:
        return 0.0
    if abs(a) >= max(abs(b), abs(c), abs(d)):
        a_prime = b * c / d if d != 0 else 0
        min_norm_value = abs(a - a_prime)
    elif abs(b) >= max(abs(a), abs(c), abs(d)):
        b_prime = a * d / c if c != 0 else 0
        min_norm_value = abs(b - b_prime)
    elif abs(c) >= max(abs(a), abs(b), abs(d)):
        c_prime = a * d / b if b != 0 else 0
        min_norm_value = abs(c - c_prime)
    else:
        d_prime = b * c / a if a != 0 else 0
        min_norm_value = abs(d - d_prime)
    return min_norm_value

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    (a, b) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]))
    (c, d) = (int(data[2]), int(data[3]))
    A = [[a, b], [c, d]]
    result = func_1(A)
    print(f'{result:.10f}')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) from the input, constructs a 2x2 matrix \(A\) using these integers, calls another function `func_1` with matrix \(A\) as input, and then prints the result of `func_1` rounded to 10 decimal places. The function does not accept any parameters and its primary action is to transform the input integers into a matrix and process it through `func_1`. Potential edge cases include the possibility of invalid input (e.g., non-integer values or more than four input values). If the input is invalid, the function may raise an exception. Additionally, the function assumes that the input is always in the correct format; otherwise, it will fail when attempting to split the input string.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the matrix determinant is zero but not due to the specific elements being adjusted in a way that minimizes the norm. Specifically, the program only checks if the determinant is exactly zero and returns 0.0 in that case. However, the problem statement asks for the minimum possible norm of a degenerate matrix \( B \) such that \( \lVert A - B \rVert \) is minimized, regardless of whether the determinant is exactly zero or not.

For example, consider the matrix \( A = \left(\begin{array}{ll}{1} & {2} \\{2} & {4} \end{array} \right) \). The determinant is \( 1 \cdot 4 - 2 \cdot 2 = 0 \), so this matrix is degenerate. The program will return 0.0 because the determinant is zero. However, the minimum possible norm of a degenerate matrix \( B \) (in this case, any matrix with a determinant of zero) would be achieved by setting the elements of \( B \) such that the determinant is zero, which might not necessarily result in the same elements as \( A \).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it calculates the minimum possible norm even when the determinant is not exactly zero but can be made zero by adjusting the elements appropriately. This involves finding the closest values to the original matrix elements that make the determinant zero.
