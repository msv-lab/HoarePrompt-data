You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The determinant of a matrix 2 × 2 is defined as follows:$\operatorname{det} \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right) = a d - b c$

A matrix is called degenerate if its determinant is equal to zero. 

The norm ||A|| of a matrix A is defined as a maximum of absolute values of its elements.

You are given a matrix $A = \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right)$. Consider any degenerate matrix B such that norm ||A - B|| is minimum possible. Determine ||A - B||.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers a and b (|a|, |b| ≤ 10^9), the elements of the first row of matrix A. 

The second line contains two integers c and d (|c|, |d| ≤ 10^9) the elements of the second row of matrix A.


-----Output-----

Output a single real number, the minimum possible value of ||A - B||. Your answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2
3 4

Output
0.2000000000

Input
1 0
0 1

Output
0.5000000000



-----Note-----

In the first sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{1.2} & {1.8} \\{2.8} & {4.2} \end{array} \right)$

In the second sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{0.5} & {0.5} \\{0.5} & {0.5} \end{array} \right)$

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(A):
    (a, b, c, d) = (A[0][0], A[0][1], A[1][0], A[1][1])
    det = a * d - b * c
    if det == 0:
        return 0.0
    if abs(a) >= max(abs(b), abs(c), abs(d)):
        a_prime = b * c / d if d != 0 else 0
        min_norm_value = abs(a - a_prime)
    elif abs(b) >= max(abs(a), abs(c), abs(d)):
        b_prime = a * d / c if c != 0 else 0
        min_norm_value = abs(b - b_prime)
    elif abs(c) >= max(abs(a), abs(b), abs(d)):
        c_prime = a * d / b if b != 0 else 0
        min_norm_value = abs(c - c_prime)
    else:
        d_prime = b * c / a if a != 0 else 0
        min_norm_value = abs(d - d_prime)
    return min_norm_value

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    (a, b) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]))
    (c, d) = (int(data[2]), int(data[3]))
    A = [[a, b], [c, d]]
    result = func_1(A)
    print(f'{result:.10f}')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) from the input, constructs a 2x2 matrix \(A\) using these integers, calls another function `func_1` with matrix \(A\) as input, and then prints the result of `func_1` rounded to 10 decimal places. The function does not accept any parameters and its primary action is to transform the input integers into a matrix and process it through `func_1`. Potential edge cases include the possibility of invalid input (e.g., non-integer values or more than four input values). If the input is invalid, the function may raise an exception. Additionally, the function assumes that the input is always in the correct format; otherwise, it will fail when attempting to split the input string.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the given function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum possible norm ||A - B|| for a degenerate matrix B, and that `func_2` properly reads the input and prints the output with the required precision.

1. **Determining the Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function aims to find the minimum possible norm of the difference between matrix A and a degenerate matrix B.
   - A degenerate matrix B has a determinant of zero. For a 2x2 matrix, this means \(ad - bc = 0\).
   - If the determinant of A is already zero, it returns 0.0 immediately, which is correct.
   - Otherwise, it computes the value of each element in B such that the determinant becomes zero and compares the absolute differences.

2. **Key Steps in `func_1`:**
   - Compute the determinant of A.
   - If the determinant is not zero, adjust one of the elements to make the determinant zero while minimizing the change in the norm.
   - Adjustments are made by setting each element to its corresponding 'prime' value derived from making the determinant zero.
   - The function returns the minimum absolute difference found.

3. **Testing with Examples:**
   - For the first example, the original matrix A is \(\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4\end{array}\right)\). The determinant is \(1*4 - 2*3 = -2\). To make it zero, adjust \(a\) or \(d\) accordingly, resulting in a minimum norm of 0.2.
   - For the second example, the original matrix A is \(\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)\). The determinant is \(1*1 - 0*0 = 1\). To make it zero, adjust \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), or \(d\) to their prime values, resulting in a minimum norm of 0.5.

4. **Checking `func_2`:**
   - This function correctly parses the input and constructs the matrix A.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the result and prints it with the required precision.

Given the logical steps and examples, both functions appear to be correctly implemented and should produce the correct output based on the problem statement.
