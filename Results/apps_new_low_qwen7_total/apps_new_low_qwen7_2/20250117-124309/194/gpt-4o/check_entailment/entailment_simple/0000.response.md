### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and splits it into the elements of the matrix \( A \). This part is correct.

2. **Matrix Degeneracy Check**: The function `func_1` checks if the matrix \( A \) is degenerate by calculating the determinant. However, the logic for determining the degenerate case is incorrect. It should simply check if the determinant \( \text{det}(A) = ad - bc = 0 \). The current implementation seems to have an unnecessary complexity for checking the degeneracy condition, but since the problem specifies the matrix is always degenerate, this issue is already handled.

3. **Minimizing the Norm**: The goal is to find a degenerate matrix \( B \) such that the norm \( ||A - B|| \) is minimized. For a degenerate matrix \( A \), the closest degenerate matrix \( B \) can be found by setting one element to a value that makes the determinant zero while keeping the other elements unchanged. The logic in `func_1` attempts to achieve this by adjusting elements based on the absolute values, but there are some logical issues.

   - The current implementation tries to set each element to a value that makes the determinant zero, but it doesn't handle the case properly. Specifically, it does not correctly identify the minimum adjustment needed for the matrix to become degenerate.
   
   - For example, in the first test case \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \), the correct adjustment would be to set \( a' = 1.2 \) and \( b' = 1.8 \), \( c' = 2.8 \) and \( d' = 4.2 \) to make the matrix degenerate, resulting in \( ||A - B|| = 0.2 \).

4. **Norm Calculation**: The norm \( ||A - B|| \) is the maximum absolute difference between corresponding elements of \( A \) and \( B \). The function `func_1` calculates the correct norm by finding the minimum adjustment needed to make the matrix degenerate.

Given the above points, the current implementation in `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly identify the minimum possible norm \( ||A - B|| \). It needs to adjust the elements of the matrix in a way that ensures the determinant is zero while minimizing the norm.

### Conclusion:

The annotated program provided is **incorrect** because it does not correctly calculate the minimum possible norm \( ||A - B|| \) for a degenerate matrix \( B \).

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
