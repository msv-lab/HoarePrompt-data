### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine the minimum possible norm of the difference between matrix \(A\) and a degenerate matrix \(B\).
   - A degenerate matrix \(B\) has a determinant of zero, i.e., \(ad - bc = 0\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function aims to find the minimum possible norm of the difference between matrix \(A\) and a degenerate matrix \(B\).
   - If the determinant of \(A\) is zero, it returns 0.0, which is correct.
   - Otherwise, it computes the value of each element in \(B\) such that the determinant becomes zero and compares the absolute differences.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it attempts to set one element to a specific value based on the others, without considering all possible combinations that could minimize the norm.

3. **Key Steps in `func_1`:**
   - The function computes the determinant of \(A\).
   - If the determinant is not zero, it tries to adjust one element at a time to make the determinant zero.
   - However, this approach is incomplete and does not consider all possible ways to make the determinant zero while minimizing the norm.

4. **Examples Analysis:**
   - For the first example, the original matrix \(A\) is \(\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4\end{array}\right)\). The determinant is \(-2\). The function should find the minimum norm of the difference between \(A\) and a degenerate matrix \(B\). However, the provided function does not handle this case correctly.
   - For the second example, the original matrix \(A\) is \(\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)\). The determinant is 1. The function should find the minimum norm of the difference between \(A\) and a degenerate matrix \(B\). Again, the provided function does not handle this case correctly.

5. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function correctly parses the input and constructs the matrix \(A\).
   - It calls `func_1` to get the result and prints it with the required precision.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall solution is incorrect.

6. **Detailed Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` only considers one element at a time and does not explore all possible degenerate matrices \(B\).
   - The function does not consider the correct mathematical approach to minimize the norm while keeping the determinant zero.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum possible norm of the difference between matrix \(A\) and a degenerate matrix \(B\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
