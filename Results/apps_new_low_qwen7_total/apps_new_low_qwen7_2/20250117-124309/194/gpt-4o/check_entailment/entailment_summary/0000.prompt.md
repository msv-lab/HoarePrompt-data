 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The determinant of a matrix 2 × 2 is defined as follows:$\operatorname{det} \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right) = a d - b c$

A matrix is called degenerate if its determinant is equal to zero. 

The norm ||A|| of a matrix A is defined as a maximum of absolute values of its elements.

You are given a matrix $A = \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right)$. Consider any degenerate matrix B such that norm ||A - B|| is minimum possible. Determine ||A - B||.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers a and b (|a|, |b| ≤ 10^9), the elements of the first row of matrix A. 

The second line contains two integers c and d (|c|, |d| ≤ 10^9) the elements of the second row of matrix A.


-----Output-----

Output a single real number, the minimum possible value of ||A - B||. Your answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2
3 4

Output
0.2000000000

Input
1 0
0 1

Output
0.5000000000



-----Note-----

In the first sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{1.2} & {1.8} \\{2.8} & {4.2} \end{array} \right)$

In the second sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{0.5} & {0.5} \\{0.5} & {0.5} \end{array} \right)$

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a 2x2 degenerate matrix `A` and returns either 0.0 or `min_norm_value`. If the determinant of the matrix `A` is 0, it returns 0.0 immediately. Otherwise, it calculates `min_norm_value` based on the following conditions:
1. If the absolute value of `a` is the largest among `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, it computes `a_prime` as `b * c / d` if `d` is not zero, otherwise 0. It then sets `min_norm_value` to the absolute difference between `a` and `a_prime`.
2. If the absolute value of `b` is the largest, it computes `b_prime` as `a * d / c` if `c` is not zero, otherwise 0. It then sets `min_norm_value` to the absolute difference between `b` and `b_prime`.
3. If the absolute value of `c` is the largest, it computes `c_prime` as `a * d / b` if `b` is not zero, otherwise 0. It then sets `min_norm_value` to the absolute difference between `c` and `c_prime`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it computes `d_prime` as `b * c / a` if `a` is not zero, otherwise 0. It then sets `min_norm_value` to the absolute difference between `d` and `d_prime`.

In all cases, the function returns the calculated `min_norm_value`. This value represents the smallest possible norm (difference) between the original elements and their adjusted counterparts, subject to the conditions specified.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    (a, b) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]))
    (c, d) = (int(data[2]), int(data[3]))
    A = [[a, b], [c, d]]
    result = func_1(A)
    print(f'{result:.10f}')
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) from the input, constructs a 2x2 matrix \(A\) using these integers, calls another function `func_1` with matrix \(A\) as input, and then prints the result of `func_1` rounded to 10 decimal places. The function does not accept any parameters and its primary action is to transform the input integers into a matrix and process it through `func_1`. Potential edge cases include the possibility of invalid input (e.g., non-integer values or more than four input values). If the input is invalid, the function may raise an exception. Additionally, the function assumes that the input is always in the correct format; otherwise, it will fail when attempting to split the input string.
