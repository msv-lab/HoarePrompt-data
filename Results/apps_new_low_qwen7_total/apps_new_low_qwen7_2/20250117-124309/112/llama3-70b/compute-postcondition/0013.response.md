Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `divisors` is a list containing at least `[1, n]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `3`.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

6. **Updating States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `3`.
   - We do not have information about changes to `n` or `divisors` from the previous iteration, so we assume they remain unchanged.

7. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` must be updated to `3`.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `divisors` remains a list containing at least `[1, n]`.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 3
- `n` is a positive integer
- `divisors` is a list containing at least `[1, n]`

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, and `divisors` is a list containing at least `[1, n]`**
