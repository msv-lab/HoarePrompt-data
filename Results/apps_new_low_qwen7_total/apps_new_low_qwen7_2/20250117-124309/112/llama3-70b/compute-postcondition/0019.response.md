The code `divisors.sort()` sorts the list `divisors`. The list `divisors` was initially populated with all integers `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ √n` and `n % i == 0`. If `i * i != n`, `n // i` is also included in `divisors`. If `i * i == n`, only `i` is included.

Sorting the list does not change the elements within the list, but it changes their order. Since the exact values of `n` and `i` are not specified, we can represent the sorted `divisors` list in a general form.

Output State: **`i` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `divisors` is a sorted list containing all divisors of `n` found during the loop execution. Specifically, `divisors` contains all integers `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ √n` and `n % i == 0`. If `i * i != n`, `n // i` is also included in `divisors`. If `i * i == n`, only `i` is included.**
