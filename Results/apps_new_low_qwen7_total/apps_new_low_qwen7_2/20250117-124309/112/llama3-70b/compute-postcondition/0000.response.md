The given code snippet reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from input and initializes an empty list called `divisors`. However, no operations are performed on `n`, `k`, or `divisors` within the provided code block. Therefore, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the list `divisors` remains empty.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\) and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), the final state remains the same as the initial state because the code does not alter these values.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, divisors is an empty list**
