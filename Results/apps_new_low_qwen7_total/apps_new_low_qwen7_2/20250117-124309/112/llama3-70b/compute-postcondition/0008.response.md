Let's analyze the given state and the loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer
- `divisors` is a list containing at least `[i, n // i]`. Specifically, if \(i * i \neq n\), `divisors` will include `n // i`.
- The precondition that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\) and `divisors` is initially an empty list is retained.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - The next value of `i` would be 2, since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration.

2. **Check the Loop Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute the next iteration, `i` must be less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the condition `i < int(n ** 0.5) + 1` is true if `int(n ** 0.5) + 1 > 1`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The variable `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The state of `divisors` might change depending on the loop body, but we cannot determine the exact changes without the loop body. However, the problem asks us to focus on adjusting the states of objects in the loop head.

### Updated State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a positive integer (unchanged)
- `divisors` is a list containing at least `[1, n // 1]`. Specifically, if \(1 * 1 \neq n\), `divisors` will include `n // 1`, which is `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `divisors` is a list containing at least `[1, n]`.**
