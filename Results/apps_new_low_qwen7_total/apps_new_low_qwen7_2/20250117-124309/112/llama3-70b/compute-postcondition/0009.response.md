The code `divisors.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2 and `divisors` is a list containing at least `[1, n]`, the list `divisors` will now include the additional element `i`, which is 2. 

Therefore, the updated list `divisors` will be `[1, n, 2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is a positive integer; `divisors` is [1, n, 2]**
