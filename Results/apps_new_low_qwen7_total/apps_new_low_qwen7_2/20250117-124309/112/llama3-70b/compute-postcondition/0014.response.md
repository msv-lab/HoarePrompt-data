`i` is appended to the list `divisors`. The initial value of `i` is 3, so `divisors` will now contain at least `[1, n, 3]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `divisors` is a list containing at least `[1, n, 3]`**
