Let's break down the given information and the conditions required for the loop to execute the first time:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{9}\).
   - `divisors` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the value of `i` should be within the range `[1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`.

4. **First Iteration Condition:**
   - The first iteration occurs when `i` is set to 1.
   - To ensure that the loop can execute the first time, `i` must be 1, and the upper limit of the range, `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given that `i` is incremented by the loop itself and starts from 1, we need to focus on the condition involving `n`.

Since the lower bound of the range is 1, the only requirement for the loop to execute the first time is that `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 1. However, since `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\), \(n\) itself is always positive and thus `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` will always be at least 1.

Therefore, the key requirement is simply that `n` must be a positive integer, which it already is based on the given constraints.

State: **`total` is irrelevant here, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer (since \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\)), `divisors` is an empty list**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer (since \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\)), `divisors` is an empty list**.
