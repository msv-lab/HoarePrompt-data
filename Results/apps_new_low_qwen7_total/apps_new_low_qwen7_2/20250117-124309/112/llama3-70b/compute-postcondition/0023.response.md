The code snippet prints the `(k-1)`-th element of the `divisors` list. Since the list `divisors` is constructed to contain all integers `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ √n` and `n % i == 0`, and if `i * i != n`, then `n // i` is also included, the value of `k` determines which divisor is printed. However, no new assignments or changes are made to any variables within this code snippet. The only operation is printing an element from the `divisors` list.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `divisors` is a sorted list containing all relevant divisors of `n`.
- `k` is less than or equal to the length of `divisors`.

After executing the code snippet, the output will be the `(k-1)`-th element of the `divisors` list.

Output State: **`i` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `divisors` is a sorted list containing all relevant divisors of `n`, `k` is less than or equal to the length of `divisors`, and the output is the `(k-1)`-th element of `divisors`.**
