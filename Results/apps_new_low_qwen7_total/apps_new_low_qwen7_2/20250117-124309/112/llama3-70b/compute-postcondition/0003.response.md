The code appends the value of `i` to the `divisors` list. Since the precondition specifies that the current value of `i` satisfies `n % i == 0`, `i` is a divisor of `n`. The `divisors` list was initially empty, so after appending `i`, it now contains `i`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer (since \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\)), `divisors` is a list containing `[i]`, and the current value of `i` satisfies \(n \% i == 0\).**
