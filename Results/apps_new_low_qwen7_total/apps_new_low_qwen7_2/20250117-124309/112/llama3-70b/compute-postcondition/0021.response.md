The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` to the console. It does not affect any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `divisors`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `divisors` is a sorted list containing all divisors of `n` found during the loop execution, specifically, `divisors` contains all integers `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ √n` and `n % i == 0`. If `i * i != n`, `n // i` is also included in `divisors`. If `i * i == n`, only `i` is included. The value of `k` is greater than the length of `divisors`.**
