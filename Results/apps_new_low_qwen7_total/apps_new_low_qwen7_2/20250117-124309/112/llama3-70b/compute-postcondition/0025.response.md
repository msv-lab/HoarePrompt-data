The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly from the provided code snippet. However, based on the given constraints, it seems the function should handle two integer parameters: `n` and `k`.

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{9}\).

Since the function definition itself is empty and no operations are shown, the possible outputs are not directly provided. We need to infer the return value based on typical use cases for such parameters, but without additional context, we can only describe the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{15}\) inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{9}\) inclusive.**
