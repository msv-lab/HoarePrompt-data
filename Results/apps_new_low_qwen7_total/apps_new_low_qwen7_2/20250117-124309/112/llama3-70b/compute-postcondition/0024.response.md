Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `divisors` is a sorted list containing all relevant divisors of `n`. If `k` is greater than the length of `divisors`, the function does not return anything (or the postcondition remains unchanged). Otherwise, the function returns the `(k-1)`-th element of `divisors`.***
