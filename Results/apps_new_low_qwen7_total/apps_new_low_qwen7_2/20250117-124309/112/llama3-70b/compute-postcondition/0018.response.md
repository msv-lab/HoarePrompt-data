Output State: **`i` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` found during the loop execution. Specifically, `divisors` contains all integers `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ √n` and `n % i == 0`. If `i * i != n`, `n // i` is also included in `divisors`. If `i * i == n`, only `i` is included.**

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `n`. For each integer `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`). If so, `i` is added to `divisors`. Additionally, if `i * i != n`, `n // i` is also added to `divisors`.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: The variable `i` changes from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `n`. The variable `n` remains constant. The variable `divisors` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop will continue to add divisors to `divisors` as long as `i` is within the range and satisfies the divisibility condition. The loop will stop once `i` exceeds the integer part of the square root of `n`. The final value of `divisors` will be a complete set of divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n` and their corresponding pairs.
4. **Verify Relationships**: The relationships and invariants identified are consistent with the described iterations and final output state. The loop ensures that all divisors of `n` up to the square root are found and added to `divisors`, ensuring completeness and accuracy.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is as described above.
