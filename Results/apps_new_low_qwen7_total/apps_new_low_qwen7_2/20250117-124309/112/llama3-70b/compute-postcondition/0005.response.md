`divisors` appends the value of `n // i`. Given that `i` is a divisor of `n` and \(i * i \neq n\), `n // i` will be another divisor of `n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the other variables also remain unaffected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `divisors` is a list containing `[i, n // i]`, and the current value of `i` satisfies \(n \% i == 0\) and \(i * i \neq n\)**
