### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` to find all divisors of `n`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `n % i == 0` to ensure `i` is indeed a divisor.
   - It appends `i` to the list `divisors`.
   - If `i * i != n`, it also appends `n // i` to ensure both divisors of pairs `(i, n//i)` are included. This is necessary because the loop only goes up to `sqrt(n)`, but both divisors of each pair must be considered.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - After collecting all divisors, the list `divisors` is sorted, which ensures they are in ascending order.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The program checks if the number of divisors is less than `k`. If true, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `k-th` smallest divisor from the sorted list (`divisors[k - 1]`).

### Analysis:

- The program logic is sound and correctly identifies all divisors of `n` and sorts them.
- The program handles the case where `n` has fewer than `k` divisors by printing `-1`.
- The program correctly finds and prints the `k-th` smallest divisor when `n` has at least `k` divisors.

### Edge Cases Considered:

- The program considers the case where `n` is a perfect square and includes both divisors of the square root.
- The program sorts the divisors, ensuring the correct order before selecting the `k-th` smallest divisor.

### Original Assessment:

- The original assessment concluded that the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and logic. The program correctly finds and outputs the `k-th` smallest divisor of `n` or `-1` if there are fewer than `k` divisors.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
