You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k. Find k-th smallest divisor of n, or report that it doesn't exist.

Divisor of n is any such natural number, that n can be divided by it without remainder.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

If n has less than k divisors, output -1.

Otherwise, output the k-th smallest divisor of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
5 3

Output
-1

Input
12 5

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first example, number 4 has three divisors: 1, 2 and 4. The second one is 2.

In the second example, number 5 has only two divisors: 1 and 5. The third divisor doesn't exist, so the answer is -1.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    divisors.sort()
    if k > len(divisors):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(divisors[k - 1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` found during the loop execution. Specifically, `divisors` contains all integers `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ √n` and `n % i == 0`. If `i * i != n`, `n // i` is also included in `divisors`. If `i * i == n`, only `i` is included.
    divisors.sort()
    if (k > len(divisors)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(divisors[k - 1])
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `divisors` is a sorted list containing all relevant divisors of `n`. If `k` is greater than the length of `divisors`, the function does not return anything (or the postcondition remains unchanged). Otherwise, the function returns the `(k-1)`-th element of `divisors`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` to find all divisors of `n`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `n % i == 0` to ensure `i` is indeed a divisor.
   - It appends `i` to the list `divisors`.
   - If `i * i != n`, it also appends `n // i` to ensure both divisors of pairs `(i, n//i)` are included. This is necessary because the loop only goes up to `sqrt(n)`, but both divisors of each pair must be considered.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - After collecting all divisors, the list `divisors` is sorted, which ensures they are in ascending order.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The program checks if the number of divisors is less than `k`. If true, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `k-th` smallest divisor from the sorted list (`divisors[k - 1]`).

### Analysis:
The logic of finding divisors, sorting them, and determining the `k-th` smallest divisor appears to be correct. The program handles the case where there are fewer than `k` divisors appropriately by printing `-1`.

Given this analysis, the provided Python program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
