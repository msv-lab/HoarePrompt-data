### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and flow of the program. Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` to find all divisors of `n`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `n % i == 0` to ensure `i` is indeed a divisor.
   - It appends `i` to the list `divisors`.
   - If `i * i != n`, it also appends `n // i` to ensure both divisors of pairs `(i, n//i)` are included. This is necessary because the loop only goes up to `sqrt(n)`, but both divisors of each pair must be considered.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - After collecting all divisors, the list `divisors` is sorted, which ensures they are in ascending order.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The program checks if the number of divisors is less than `k`. If true, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `k-th` smallest divisor from the sorted list (`divisors[k - 1]`).

The original assessment provides a clear and accurate description of these steps and their correctness. The program correctly finds all divisors of `n`, sorts them, and determines the `k-th` smallest divisor if it exists. 

Given the thorough analysis and the clear logic provided in the original assessment, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.
