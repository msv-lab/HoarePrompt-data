Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the divisors list might not be sorted in ascending order, which is necessary for finding the k-th smallest divisor. Specifically, the program calculates all divisors up to the square root of `n` and appends them to the `divisors` list. However, it does not ensure that the divisors are sorted before checking the length against `k`. This can lead to incorrect results if the divisors are not sorted properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
8 3
```
The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The program calculates these divisors but does not sort them. It then checks if the length of the divisors list is greater than or equal to `k`, which is true. However, since the divisors are not sorted, the third element (index 2) might not be the third smallest divisor. In this case, the third smallest divisor is 4, but the program would incorrectly print the fourth element (index 3), which is 8.

To fix this, the divisors list should be sorted before accessing the k-th element. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    divisors.sort()
    if k > len(divisors):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(divisors[k - 1])
```

With this correction, the program will correctly find the k-th smallest divisor for all valid inputs.
