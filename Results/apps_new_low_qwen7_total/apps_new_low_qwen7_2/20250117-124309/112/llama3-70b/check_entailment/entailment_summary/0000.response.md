Reasoning:
The given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to find the k-th smallest divisor of n. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the standard input. This part is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Finding Divisors**: The program iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find all divisors. For each `i` where `n % i == 0`, both `i` and `n // i` are added to the list of divisors. This ensures that all divisors are captured, including pairs like `(1, n)` and `(sqrt(n), sqrt(n))` if `n` is a perfect square. This is a standard approach to finding all divisors efficiently.

3. **Sorting Divisors**: After collecting all divisors, they are sorted. Sorting is necessary to determine the k-th smallest divisor.

4. **Output Handling**: The program checks if `k` is greater than the number of divisors. If it is, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the k-th smallest divisor, which is obtained by indexing into the sorted list of divisors with `divisors[k - 1]`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where `n` might have fewer than `k` divisors by printing `-1` if `k` exceeds the number of divisors.

Given these points, the program should work correctly within the specified constraints and produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
