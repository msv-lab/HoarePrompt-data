### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` to find all divisors of `n`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `n % i == 0` to ensure `i` is indeed a divisor.
   - It appends `i` to the list `divisors`.
   - If `i * i != n`, it also appends `n // i` to ensure both divisors of pairs `(i, n//i)` are included. This is necessary because the loop only goes up to `sqrt(n)`, but both divisors of each pair must be considered.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - After collecting all divisors, the list `divisors` is sorted, which ensures they are in ascending order.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The program checks if the number of divisors is less than `k`. If true, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `k-th` smallest divisor from the sorted list (`divisors[k - 1]`).

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **State before the for loop**: 
  - `i` starts at `1`.
  - `n` is a positive integer within the range `[1, 10^15]`.
  - `k` is an integer within the range `[1, 10^9]`.
  - `divisors` is initially empty.

- **During the for loop**:
  - For each `i` in the range `[1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1]`, if `n % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `n` and is added to `divisors`.
  - If `i * i != n`, then `n // i` is also added to `divisors`. This ensures all divisors of `n` are captured, including those from the second half of the factor pairs.

- **After the for loop**:
  - `divisors` contains all divisors of `n` in ascending order.
  - `i` is set to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

- **Sorting the divisors**:
  - The `divisors` list is sorted, which is unnecessary since the loop naturally collects divisors in ascending order.

- **Output Determination**:
  - If `k > len(divisors)`, the program prints `-1`.
  - Otherwise, the program prints the `k-th` smallest divisor, which is `divisors[k - 1]`.

### Validation:

- The program correctly identifies and sorts all divisors of `n`.
- The check `if k > len(divisors)` ensures that the program prints `-1` if there are fewer than `k` divisors.
- The access `divisors[k - 1]` correctly retrieves the `k-th` smallest divisor if available.
