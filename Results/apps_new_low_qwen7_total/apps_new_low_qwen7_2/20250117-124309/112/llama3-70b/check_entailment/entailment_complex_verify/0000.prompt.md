You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k. Find k-th smallest divisor of n, or report that it doesn't exist.

Divisor of n is any such natural number, that n can be divided by it without remainder.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

If n has less than k divisors, output -1.

Otherwise, output the k-th smallest divisor of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
5 3

Output
-1

Input
12 5

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first example, number 4 has three divisors: 1, 2 and 4. The second one is 2.

In the second example, number 5 has only two divisors: 1 and 5. The third divisor doesn't exist, so the answer is -1.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    divisors.sort()
    if k > len(divisors):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(divisors[k - 1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` found during the loop execution. Specifically, `divisors` contains all integers `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ √n` and `n % i == 0`. If `i * i != n`, `n // i` is also included in `divisors`. If `i * i == n`, only `i` is included.
    divisors.sort()
    if (k > len(divisors)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(divisors[k - 1])
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `divisors` is a sorted list containing all relevant divisors of `n`. If `k` is greater than the length of `divisors`, the function does not return anything (or the postcondition remains unchanged). Otherwise, the function returns the `(k-1)`-th element of `divisors`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{15}\) inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{9}\) inclusive. It calculates all divisors of `n` and sorts them. If `k` is greater than the number of divisors of `n`, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor of `n`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is a perfect square, where both the square root and its corresponding pair divisor would be included in the list of divisors. The function does not handle cases where the input values do not meet the specified ranges, which could lead to undefined behavior.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the divisors list might not be sorted in ascending order, which is necessary for finding the k-th smallest divisor. Specifically, the program calculates all divisors up to the square root of `n` and appends them to the `divisors` list. However, it does not ensure that the divisors are sorted before checking the length against `k`. This can lead to incorrect results if the divisors are not sorted properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
8 3
```
The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The program calculates these divisors but does not sort them. It then checks if the length of the divisors list is greater than or equal to `k`, which is true. However, since the divisors are not sorted, the third element (index 2) might not be the third smallest divisor. In this case, the third smallest divisor is 4, but the program would incorrectly print the fourth element (index 3), which is 8.

To fix this, the divisors list should be sorted before accessing the k-th element. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    divisors.sort()
    if k > len(divisors):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(divisors[k - 1])
```

With this correction, the program will correctly find the k-th smallest divisor for all valid inputs.
