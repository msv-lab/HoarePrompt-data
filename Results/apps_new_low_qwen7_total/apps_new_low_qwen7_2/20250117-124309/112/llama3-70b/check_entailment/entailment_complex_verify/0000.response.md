### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code and the original assessment step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates over the range from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` to find all divisors of `n`. For each `i` such that `n % i == 0`, `i` is added to the `divisors` list. If `i * i != n`, `n // i` is also added to the `divisors` list. This ensures that both the smaller and larger divisors are captured.

3. **Sorting the Divisors**:
   - After collecting the divisors, the `divisors` list is sorted. Sorting is crucial because the `k`-th smallest divisor is only meaningful if the list is in ascending order.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than the length of the `divisors` list. If so, it prints `-1`, indicating that there are fewer than `k` divisors.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `(k-1)`-th element of the sorted `divisors` list, which corresponds to the `k`-th smallest divisor.

Given the above steps, let's validate the original assessment:

- **Original Assessment**: The assessment claims that the program does not correctly handle cases where the divisors list might not be sorted in ascending order. It suggests that the divisors list is not sorted before checking the length against `k`.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code, we see that the `divisors` list is explicitly sorted using `divisors.sort()` before the final check and output. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the sorting step ensures that the list is in ascending order, making the subsequent logic correct.

### Final Evaluation:
- **Final**: **True**

The given program is correct as it includes the necessary step to sort the divisors before determining the `k`-th smallest divisor.
