The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{15}\) inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{9}\) inclusive. It calculates all divisors of `n` and sorts them. If `k` is greater than the number of divisors of `n`, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor of `n`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is a perfect square, where both the square root and its corresponding pair divisor would be included in the list of divisors. The function does not handle cases where the input values do not meet the specified ranges, which could lead to undefined behavior.
