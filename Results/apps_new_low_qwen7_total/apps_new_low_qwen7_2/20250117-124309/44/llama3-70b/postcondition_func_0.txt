The function reads an integer \( n \) and then \( n \) pairs of integers \((x_i, y_i)\) from the standard input, representing vectors. It sorts these vectors based on their polar angles and then finds the pair of vectors with the smallest angle between them. The function outputs the indices (1-based) of these two vectors. If the number of vectors \( n \) exceeds 100, the function only considers the first 100 vectors for finding the smallest angle.
