To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given for loop and analyze the variables involved.

Given for loop:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization**:
   - The loop variable `j` will take values from `i + 1` up to but not including `min(n, i + 100)`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is initially set to 1.
   - `n` is the same as its initial value, which is greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Condition for the First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range defined by `range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))` must contain at least one value.
   - This means that `i + 1` must be less than `min(n, i + 100)`.

4. **Evaluating the Range Condition**:
   - Since `i = 1`, we evaluate `i + 1 = 2`.
   - We need to check if `2 < min(n, i + 100)`.
   - Given that `n >= 1`, `min(n, i + 100)` will be `min(n, 1 + 100) = min(n, 101)`.
   - Therefore, `2 < min(n, 101)`.

5. **Ensuring the Condition**:
   - For `2 < min(n, 101)` to be true, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `n` is at least 1 and can be 1, 2, or greater).
   - If `n` is exactly 1 or 2, the condition `2 < min(n, 101)` would not be satisfied, and the loop would not execute.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**
