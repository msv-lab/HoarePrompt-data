Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 0.

### Code of the Loop
```python
for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
    angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))
    if angle < ans_angle:
        ans_angle = angle
        ans = i, j
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - For each `j`, it calculates the cosine of the angle between vectors `v[i]` and `v[j]`.
   - If this angle (`angle`) is less than the current `ans_angle`, it updates `ans_angle` and sets `ans` to `(i, j)`.

2. **Variables Involved**:
   - `i` starts at 0 and remains unchanged within the loop since the loop only increments `j`.
   - `n` remains constant as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `v` is a matrix containing vector components, which also remains unchanged.
   - `ans_angle` is updated if a smaller angle is found.
   - `ans` is updated if a smaller angle is found.

3. **Loop Invariants**:
   - `i` remains 0 because the loop does not modify it.
   - `n` remains the same as the initial value provided.
   - `v` remains the same as the initial value provided.

4. **Output State After All Executions**:
   - Since `i` does not change, `i` will always be 0.
   - `n` will be the same as the initial value.
   - `ans_angle` will be the smallest angle found during the loop execution among all pairs `(0, j)` where `j` ranges from 1 to `min(n, 100)`.
   - `ans` will be the pair `(0, j)` corresponding to the smallest `angle`.

### Final Output State
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the same as the initial value (greater than or equal to 1).
- `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found between `v[0]` and any `v[j]` where `1 <= j < min(n, 100)`.
- `ans` is the pair `(0, j)` corresponding to the smallest `angle`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the same as the initial value (greater than or equal to 1), `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found between `v[0]` and any `v[j]` where `1 <= j < min(n, 100)`, and `ans` is the pair `(0, j)` corresponding to the smallest `angle`.**
