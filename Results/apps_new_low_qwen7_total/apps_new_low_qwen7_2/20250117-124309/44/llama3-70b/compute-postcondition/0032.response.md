Output State: **i is 1, j is 3, ans is (1, 3), ans_angle is the same as the value of angle**

Explanation:
- The initial state is given as: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, and `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[1][0] * v[3][0] + v[1][1] * v[3][1]) / math.sqrt(v[1][0]**2 + v[1][1]**2)) * math.sqrt(v[3][0]**2 + v[3][1]**2))`.
- The first line `ans_angle = angle` simply assigns the value of `angle` to `ans_angle`, so `ans_angle` now holds the same value as `angle`.
- The second line `ans = i, j` creates a tuple `ans` containing the values of `i` and `j`. Therefore, `ans` is now `(1, 3)`.
- No other variables are modified by the code block. Thus, the final output state includes `i`, `j`, `ans`, and `ans_angle` with their respective values, while preserving the initial condition that `n` is greater than 2.
