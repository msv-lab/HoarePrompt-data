Initial State: `n` is an integer and greater than 0, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the last element is `(input_x, input_y)`, `x` is `input_x`, `y` is `input_y`, and `n` is `n - 1`

Code Block:
```
x, y = map(int, input().split())
v.append((x, y))
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input and converts them to integers, then assigns these values to `x` and `y`.
2. The second line `v.append((x, y))` appends a tuple containing the new values of `x` and `y` to the list `v`.

Since the initial values of `x` and `y` are replaced by the input values, we need to consider the new values of `x` and `y` after the input. However, the initial state does not specify the exact values of `input_x` and `input_y`. For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume the input is `10 20`.

After running the code block with the assumed input, the new values are:
- `x` is now 10
- `y` is now 20
- The list `v` is now one element longer, with the last element being `(10, 20)`

Therefore, the final state is:
Output State: **n is an integer and greater than 0, v is a list of length n + 2 with the last element (10, 20), x is 10, y is 20**
