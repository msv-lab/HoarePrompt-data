Output State: **n is an integer and greater than 0, v is a list of length 2n sorted by the angle (math.atan2) formed by each element's components, ans is (0, 1), ans_angle is pi**

Explanation:
- The line `ans = 0, 1` initializes a tuple `ans` with the values 0 and 1.
- The line `ans_angle = math.pi` assigns the value of `math.pi` to the variable `ans_angle`.
- The line `v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))` sorts the list `v` based on the angle formed by the components of each element in the list, using the `math.atan2` function. This sorting operation modifies the order of elements in `v`, but does not change the inherent properties of `n`, `ans`, or `ans_angle`.

Note that the exact values within `v` are not specified, but it is guaranteed that `v` will be sorted according to the angles defined by its elements' coordinates.
