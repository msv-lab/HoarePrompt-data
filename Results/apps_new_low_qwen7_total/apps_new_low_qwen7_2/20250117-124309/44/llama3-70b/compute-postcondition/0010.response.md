To determine the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- The initial state before the loop: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0.
- The for loop: `for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts from `i + 1`, which means the loop starts from `1` since `i` is initially `0`.
   - The loop continues as long as `j < min(n, i + 100)`.
   - Since `i` is `0`, the upper bound of the range is `min(n, 100)`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

3. **First Iteration Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must start from `1` (since `i + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`).
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < min(n, 100)`.
   - Since `n` must be at least `1`, the minimum value of `min(n, 100)` is `1`.
   - Therefore, `j` can take the value `1` if `min(n, 100) >= 1`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `i` must be `0`.
- `n` must be at least `1` (to ensure `min(n, 100) >= 1`).

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
