Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable `i` is used in the `range(n)` function, which means it starts from 0 up to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

3. **Consider the initial condition**: At the start of the loop, `n` is specified to be greater than or equal to 100. Since the loop has already run at least once (`i = 1`), `n` must still satisfy this condition. However, for the next iteration to occur, `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Update the state**: Since `i` will increment by 1 in the next iteration, `i` will become 2. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to continue.

5. **Maintain other variables**: The variables `ans` and `ans_angle` are not directly controlled by the loop itself but might be updated inside the loop body. However, based on the problem statement, these variables do not change their values as part of the loop head conditions.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `n` to ensure it is greater than 2.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is (1, j), and `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found during the loop iterations.**
