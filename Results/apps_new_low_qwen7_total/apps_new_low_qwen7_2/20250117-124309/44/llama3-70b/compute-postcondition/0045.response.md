Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop, which are `j` and `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = i + 1` to `j = min(n, i + 100)`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 3
   - `ans` is either (2, 3) or (1, 3) depending on whether `angle` is less than `ans_angle`

4. **Determine the Next State of `j`**:
   - Since `j` starts at `i + 1` and increases by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` would be 4 if the loop continues.

5. **Determine the Next State of `i`**:
   - The value of `i` does not change within the loop. It remains 2.

6. **Determine the Next State of `ans`**:
   - The value of `ans` depends on the comparison between `angle` and `ans_angle` during the current iteration. Since we don't know the outcome of the loop body, `ans` could still be either (2, 3) or (1, 3).

Given these points, we can summarize the state adjustments needed for the next iteration of the loop:

- `i` remains 2.
- `j` changes to 4.
- `ans` remains either (2, 3) or (1, 3), but we cannot specify which one without knowing the result of the loop body.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ans` is either (2, 3) or (1, 3) depending on whether `angle` is less than `ans_angle`**
