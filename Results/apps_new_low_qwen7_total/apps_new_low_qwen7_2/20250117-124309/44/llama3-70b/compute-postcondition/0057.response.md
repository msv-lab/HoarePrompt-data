Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) and then \( n \) pairs of integers \((x_i, y_i)\) from the standard input, representing vectors. It sorts these vectors based on their polar angles and then finds the pair of vectors with the smallest angle between them. The function outputs the indices (1-based) of these two vectors. If the number of vectors \( n \) exceeds 100, the function only considers the first 100 vectors for finding the smallest angle.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If \( n \leq 1 \), the function should handle this case appropriately, possibly by printing an error message or returning a specific value indicating no valid pair was found.
- The code assumes \( n \geq 2 \) since it needs to find an angle between two vectors. For \( n = 1 \), the function would not enter the nested loops and thus would need to handle this case separately.
- The code only considers up to the first 100 vectors for finding the smallest angle, which means if \( n > 100 \), the remaining vectors are ignored. This could be an issue if the smallest angle occurs among the vectors beyond the first 100.
- The function does not validate if the input values meet the specified constraints (e.g., \( 2 \leq n \leq 100,000 \) and \( |x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10,000 \)). It would be necessary to add validation checks for these conditions.
