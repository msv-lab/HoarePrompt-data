Output State: **n is an integer and greater than 0, v is a list of length 2n, x is the last input_x received, y is the last input_y received.**

### Analysis

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs `n` times.
   - In each iteration, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from input.
   - It appends the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `v`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n`: The initial integer provided, remains constant.
   - `v`: The list gets extended by one element in each iteration, so after `n` iterations, its length will be `n + n = 2n`.
   - `x` and `y`: These are updated in each iteration but remain as the values read in the last iteration once the loop completes.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After `n` iterations, the list `v` will contain `n` tuples, each representing a pair of integers `(x, y)` read from input.
   - The final values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers read from input.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationship between the loop's behavior and the output state is consistent with the provided examples:
     - After 1 iteration: `v` has length `1`, `x` and `y` are the first inputs.
     - After 2 iterations: `v` has length `2`, `x` and `y` are the second inputs.
     - After 3 iterations: `v` has length `3`, `x` and `y` are the third inputs.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing all `n` iterations, the final state is as described above.
