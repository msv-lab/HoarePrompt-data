Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will iterate from `0` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Initial State of `i`**: When the loop starts, `i` is initialized to `0`.

4. **Initial State of `n`**: According to the given state before the loop starts, `n` is an integer and greater than 0.

5. **Other Variables**: The variables `v`, `ans`, and `ans_angle` are not directly controlled by the loop itself but rather by the loop body. Therefore, their states do not need to be modified specifically for the loop to execute for the first time.

Given this analysis, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time are:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` must be `0`.

Therefore, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
