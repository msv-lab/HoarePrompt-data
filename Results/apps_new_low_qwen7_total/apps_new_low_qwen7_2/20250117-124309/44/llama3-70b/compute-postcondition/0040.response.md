Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

Given:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2
- `ans` is (1, j)
- `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found during the loop iterations

The for loop is defined as:
```
for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Range Definition**:
   - The loop starts with `j = i + 1`, which means `j = 3` because `i` is 2.
   - The loop ends when `j` reaches the minimum value between `n` and `i + 100`.

2. **Initial Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at all, there must be at least one value of `j` that satisfies the condition `i + 1 <= j < min(n, i + 100)`.
   - Given `i` is 2, the loop will start at `j = 3` and continue until `j` is less than `min(n, 102)`.

3. **Determining the Minimum Value for `j`**:
   - Since `i` is 2, the smallest possible value for `j` is `3`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 3 (since `i + 100` is 102, and `n` must be greater than 2).

4. **Variables and Their States**:
   - `i` is fixed at 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 (as given).
   - `j` must be able to start from 3 for the loop to execute the first time.
   - `ans` and `ans_angle` are not directly relevant to the loop starting condition but will be updated within the loop.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must start from 3. Given that `i` is 2, this condition will be met if `n` is at least 3.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `j` must be 3, ans is (1, j), and ans_angle is the minimum angle found during the loop iterations**.
