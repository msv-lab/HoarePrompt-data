Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `angle` is calculated using `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**. If `angle` is less than `ans_angle`, then `ans_angle` is set to `angle` and `ans` is set to `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, the original values of `ans_angle` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
