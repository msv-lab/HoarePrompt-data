Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 2
   - `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[1][0] * v[j][0] + v[1][1] * v[j][1]) / (math.sqrt(v[1][0] * v[1][0] + v[1][1] * v[1][1])))`
   - `ans` remains unchanged if `angle` is not less than `ans_angle`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each value of `j` within the specified range, the loop body will be executed, but since the actual loop body is omitted, we focus on how the states are modified.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop modifies the state of `j` by incrementing it until it reaches the upper bound.
   - The loop does not modify `i` or `n` directly.
   - The loop calculates `angle` for each `j` and checks if it is less than `ans_angle`.

5. **State After Loop:**
   - Since the loop continues as long as `j` is within the range and `j < min(n, i + 100)`, the loop can continue executing as long as `j` is within the specified bounds.
   - Therefore, `i` remains unchanged and `n` remains unchanged.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 2` (since it starts from `i + 1`).

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is still 1.
   - `n` is still greater than 2.
   - `j` will be `i + 2` (which is 3).
   - `angle` will be recalculated for `j = 3`.
   - `ans` will remain unchanged unless the new `angle` is less than `ans_angle`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[1][0] * v[3][0] + v[1][1] * v[3][1]) / (math.sqrt(v[1][0] * v[1][0] + v[1][1] * v[1][1])))`, if `angle` is less than `ans_angle`, then `ans` is set to `(1, 3).` Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
