Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 100, `ans` is (1, j), and `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found during the loop iterations.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs for each `j` from `i+1` to `min(n, i+100)`.
   - The variable `i` starts at 1 and does not change within the loop, making it invariant.
   - The variable `n` remains constant as specified in the initial state.
   - The `angle` is calculated based on the dot product and magnitudes of vectors `v[i]` and `v[j]`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` remains constant at 1.
   - `j` increments from `i+1` (which is 2) to `min(n, i+100)` (which is 101 if `n >= 101`).
   - `ans` and `ans_angle` are updated only if the current `angle` is smaller than the previously stored `ans_angle`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will run as long as `j` is in the range `[2, min(n, 101)]`.
   - For each iteration, `angle` is computed and compared with `ans_angle`.
   - If `angle` is smaller, `ans` and `ans_angle` are updated. Otherwise, they remain unchanged.
   - After all iterations, `ans` will hold the indices `(1, j)` corresponding to the smallest angle found, and `ans_angle` will hold that minimum angle value.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - Since `i` is fixed at 1, the loop effectively searches through vectors starting from index 2 up to `min(n, 101)`.
   - The output state confirms that `i` remains 1, `n` is unchanged, and `ans` and `ans_angle` reflect the smallest angle found between `v[1]` and any vector `v[j]` where `j` ranges from 2 to `min(n, 101)`.
