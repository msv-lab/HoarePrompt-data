The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input stream, which includes an integer `n` representing the number of vectors (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `x_i` and `y_i` representing the coordinates of the i-th vector (|`x_i`|, |`y_i`| ≤ 10 000, `x_i`^2 + `y_i`^2 > 0). No two vectors share the same direction but can have opposite directions.

The function does not return any value explicitly but processes the input to determine the result based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read an integer `n` and then `n` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` from the standard input, process these vectors, and perform some operation based on the given constraints. However, since there is no specific output mentioned in the problem statement, we can only describe what it accepts.
