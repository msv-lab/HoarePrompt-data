Output State: **i is 0, j is unspecified, ans is (0, unspecified), ans_angle is angle**

Explanation:
- The first line assigns the value of the `angle` variable to `ans_angle`. This does not change the value of `angle`, it just copies it.
- The second line sets `ans` to a tuple `(i, j)`. Since `i` is initially 0 and `j` is unspecified (not given a value in the code snippet), `j` remains unspecified. Therefore, `ans` is set to `(0, unspecified)`.

No other variables are affected by the provided code snippet.
