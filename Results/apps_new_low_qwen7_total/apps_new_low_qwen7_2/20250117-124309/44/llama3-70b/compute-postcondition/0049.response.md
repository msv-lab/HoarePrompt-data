Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the range for `j` as `range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 4
   - `ans` is (1, 3) unless `angle` is less than `ans_angle`, in which case `ans` becomes (2, 4)
   - `ans_angle` is not mentioned, but it doesn't affect the adjustment of loop variables

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - Since `i` is 2, the range for `j` is from `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)`, which translates to `j` ranging from 3 to `min(n, 102)`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` remains 2 because it does not change within the loop.
   - `j` will increment by 1 from its current value of 4 to the next value in the range.

Therefore, if the loop is to execute again, `j` will be 5 (the next value in the range).

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 5**
