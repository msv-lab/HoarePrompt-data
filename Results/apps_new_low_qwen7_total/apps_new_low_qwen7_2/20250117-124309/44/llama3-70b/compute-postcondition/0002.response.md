The provided code snippet takes two integers `x` and `y` as input, splits them using `map(int, input().split())`, and then appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `v`. The variables `x` and `y` are local to this code block and do not affect the global variables `n` and `v`.

Since the initial state is that `n` is an integer and greater than 0, and `v` is a list of length `n`, and there are no further operations on `n` or `v` within the provided code block, the values of `n` and `v` remain unchanged.

The code also introduces `x` and `y` as local variables within the scope of the block, which are not specified in the initial state, and they are updated based on user input.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **n is an integer and greater than 0, v is a list of length n, x is an integer, y is an integer**
