Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the condition for the loop. The loop runs for `j` starting from `i + 1` up to but not including `min(n, i + 100)`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the initial condition must still hold. Specifically, `j` must be less than `min(n, i + 100)`. 

3. **Current States**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 3
   - `ans` is (1, 3)
   - `ans_angle` is the value of `angle` if `angle < ans_angle`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, and `ans_angle` remain unchanged.

4. **Update the State**:
   - The variable `i` does not change within the loop, so it remains 1.
   - The variable `j` starts at 3 and will increment by 1 in each iteration. To continue the loop, `j` must be less than `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - Since `i` is 1, `i + 100` is 101. Therefore, `j` must be less than `min(n, 101)` to continue the loop.
   - The values of `ans` and `ans_angle` will only change if the condition `angle < ans_angle` is met. Since we do not have the current value of `angle`, we cannot determine if `ans` or `ans_angle` will change. However, the initial values remain the same unless the loop body updates them.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` must be 4 (the next possible value after 3) and must be less than `min(n, 101)` to continue the loop.
   - `ans` remains (1, 3) unless the loop body updates it.
   - `ans_angle` remains the value of `angle` if `angle < ans_angle` unless the loop body updates it.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, `ans` is (1, 3), and `ans_angle` is the value of `angle` if `angle < ans_angle`**.
