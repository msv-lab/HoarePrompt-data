The initial state is defined as follows: `n` is an integer and greater than 0, `v` is a list of length `n`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer.

The code snippet is:
```python
x, y = map(int, input().split())
v.append((x, y))
```

This code takes two integers as input, assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively, and then appends a tuple containing these two integers to the list `v`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we can represent them generically as `input_x` and `input_y`. After running the code, the list `v` will have one additional element, which is the tuple `(input_x, input_y)`. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the input values, and `n` remains unchanged since no operation is performed on it.

Therefore, the final output state will be:

Output State: **n is an integer and greater than 0, v is a list of length n+1 where the last element is (input_x, input_y), x is input_x, y is input_y**
