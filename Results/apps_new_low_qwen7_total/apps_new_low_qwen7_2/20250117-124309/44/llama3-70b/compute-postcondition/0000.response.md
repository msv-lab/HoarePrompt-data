The given code snippet reads the number of vectors `n` and initializes an empty list `v` to store the vectors. However, the code does not continue to read the vectors' coordinates or process them. Therefore, after running this snippet, the list `v` will contain `n` entries, but these entries will remain undefined because no further instructions are provided to fill the list.

Output State: **n is an integer, v is a list of length n (all entries are undefined)**
