Let's analyze the provided code snippet step by step:

Initial State:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 4
- `ans` is (1, 3)
- `ans_angle` is the value of `angle` if `angle < ans_angle`
- `angle` is `math.acos((v[1][0] * v[4][0] + v[1][1] * v[4][1]) / math.sqrt(v[1][0]**2 + v[1][1]**2))`
- `v` is an array or list that contains at least elements indexed as [1] and [4]

Code Snippet:
```python
ans_angle = angle
ans = i, j
```

Explanation of Code Execution:
1. `ans_angle = angle`: This line assigns the current value of `angle` to `ans_angle`. Since `angle` is calculated based on the dot product and magnitudes of vectors `v[1]` and `v[4]`, this assignment retains the value of `angle`.
2. `ans = i, j`: This line updates the tuple `ans` to hold the values of `i` and `j`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 4, `ans` becomes (1, 4).

No other variables are affected by the given code snippet.

Final State:
- `i` is still 1
- `j` is still 4
- `ans` is now (1, 4)
- `ans_angle` is still the value of `angle` (which is `math.acos((v[1][0] * v[4][0] + v[1][1] * v[4][1]) / math.sqrt(v[1][0]**2 + v[1][1]**2)))`
- `angle` is still `math.acos((v[1][0] * v[4][0] + v[1][1] * v[4][1]) / math.sqrt(v[1][0]**2 + v[1][1]**2))`

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **i is 1, j is 4, ans is (1, 4), ans_angle is the value of angle (calculated as math.acos((v[1][0] * v[4][0] + v[1][1] * v[4][1]) / math.sqrt(v[1][0]**2 + v[1][1]**2))), angle is math.acos((v[1][0] * v[4][0] + v[1][1] * v[4][1]) / math.sqrt(v[1][0]**2 + v[1][1]**2))**
