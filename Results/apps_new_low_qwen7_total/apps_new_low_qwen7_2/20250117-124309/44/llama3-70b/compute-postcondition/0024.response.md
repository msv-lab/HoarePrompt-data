Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is the same as the initial value (greater than or equal to 1)
- `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found between `v[0]` and any `v[j]` where `1 <= j < min(n, 100)`
- `ans` is the pair `(0, j)` corresponding to the smallest `angle`

### Loop Head Analysis:
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

From the loop head, we can identify the following variables:
- `i`
- `n`

### Loop Execution:
- The loop starts with `i = 0`.
- For each iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

### End of Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is the same as the initial value (greater than or equal to 1)
- `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found between `v[0]` and any `v[j]` where `1 <= j < min(n, 100)`
- `ans` is the pair `(0, j)` corresponding to the smallest `angle`

### Next Iteration:
- Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `1`.
- The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.
- The values of `ans_angle` and `ans` will be updated within the loop body, but we don't have the details of the loop body.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will be incremented to `1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `ans_angle` and `ans` will be updated within the loop body, but their values are not specified here.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial value (greater than or equal to 1)**
