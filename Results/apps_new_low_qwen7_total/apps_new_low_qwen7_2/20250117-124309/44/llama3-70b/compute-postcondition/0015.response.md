Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `angle` is calculated using `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2))`

### For Loop Statement
```python
for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in this case is `j`. Other variables such as `i` and `n` are also part of the loop head but their values will be adjusted based on the condition of the loop.

2. **Condition for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - The loop runs from `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will run from `0 + 1` (i.e., 1) to `min(n, 0 + 100)`, which simplifies to `min(n, 100)`.

3. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `angle` is already calculated and its value doesn't change within the loop.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be in the range `[1, min(n, 100)]`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variables that need adjustment are `i`, `n`, and `angle`.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `angle` remains unchanged and is already calculated based on the initial values.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration

- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `angle` is already calculated and remains unchanged.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `angle` is calculated using `math.acos((v[0][0] * v[j][0] + v[0][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[0][0]**2 + v[0][1]**2))`**
