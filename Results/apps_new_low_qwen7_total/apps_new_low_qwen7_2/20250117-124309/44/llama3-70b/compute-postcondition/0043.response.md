Output State: **i is 2, j is 3, ans is (2, 3), ans_angle is angle**

Explanation:
- The first line `ans_angle = angle` assigns the value of `angle` to `ans_angle`.
- The second line `ans = i, j` updates `ans` to be a tuple `(i, j)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, so `ans` becomes `(2, 3)`.

No other variables are affected by the provided code snippet. The values of `n` and `v` remain unchanged from the initial state.
