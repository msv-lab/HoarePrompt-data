Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the non-oriented angle between vectors. Specifically, the program uses the dot product and the `math.acos` function to calculate the oriented angle between vectors, which does not directly give the non-oriented angle. Additionally, the program sorts the vectors using `math.atan2`, but it does not correctly handle the case where the sorted vectors might not be in the optimal order for finding the minimal non-oriented angle.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
-1 0
0 -1
1 0
1 1
```

The expected output is a pair of indices with the minimal non-oriented angle, which in this case would be (3, 4) since the angle between (1, 0) and (1, 1) is π/4, and the angle between (1, 1) and (-1, 0) is also π/4. However, the provided program might not correctly identify this minimal angle due to its approach to calculating and comparing angles.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to ensure that the angles are calculated considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions and then find the minimum non-oriented angle.
