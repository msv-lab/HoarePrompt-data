Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of vectors `n` and the coordinates of each vector `x_i, y_i`.

2. **Sorting Vectors**: The vectors are sorted using their polar angles (obtained using `math.atan2(v[1], v[0])`). This is a crucial step as it allows us to easily find the closest angles between consecutive vectors in the sorted list.

3. **Finding Minimal Angle**: The nested loops iterate through pairs of vectors to calculate the angle between them. The cosine formula is used to compute the angle between two vectors `v[i]` and `v[j]`. However, the implementation of this formula seems incorrect. Specifically, the expression:
   ```python
   angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))
   ```
   should be corrected to:
   ```python
   angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / (math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) * math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2)))
   ```

4. **Updating Answer**: If a smaller angle is found, `ans` is updated to the indices of the current pair of vectors, and `ans_angle` is updated to the new minimum angle.

5. **Output**: The indices of the vectors with the minimal angle are printed, adjusted by adding 1 to the indices.

Given these points, the provided solution has a logical flaw in the angle calculation due to the incorrect formula used. Therefore, the program will not work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
