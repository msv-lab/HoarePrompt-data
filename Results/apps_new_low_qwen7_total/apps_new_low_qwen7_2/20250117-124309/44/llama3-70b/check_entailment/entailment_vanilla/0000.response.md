### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Vector Representation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of vectors `n` and then processes each vector `(x, y)` by storing them in a list `v`. This part is correct.

2. **Sorting Vectors:**
   - The vectors are sorted using `math.atan2(v[1], v[0])`, which calculates the angle of each vector relative to the positive x-axis. This is a valid approach to ensure the vectors are ordered by their polar angles, making it easier to find the smallest angle.

3. **Finding Minimal Angle:**
   - The program iterates over pairs of vectors, but only up to `min(n, i + 100)`. This is an optimization to avoid unnecessary comparisons, which is valid since the number of vectors `n` is at most 100,000.
   - The angle between two vectors is calculated using the dot product formula: 
     \[
     \text{angle} = \math.acos\left(\frac{\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j}{|\mathbf{v}_i| |\mathbf{v}_j|}\right)
     \]
     where \(\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j\) is the dot product of the vectors, and \(|\mathbf{v}_i|\) and \(|\mathbf{v}_j|\) are their magnitudes. This calculation is correct.

4. **Updating Minimum Angle:**
   - The program updates the minimum angle and corresponding indices whenever it finds a smaller angle. This logic is also correct.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the indices of the vectors found with the minimal angle, adjusted by adding 1 to match 1-based indexing as required by the problem statement. This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct and follows the specified problem requirements accurately. Therefore:
