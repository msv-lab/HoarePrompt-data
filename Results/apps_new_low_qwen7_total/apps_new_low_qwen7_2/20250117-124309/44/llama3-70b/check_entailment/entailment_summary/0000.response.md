Reasoning:
The given program aims to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of vectors \( n \) and the coordinates of each vector.
2. **Sorting Vectors**: The vectors are sorted based on their polar angles using `math.atan2`, which is appropriate for determining the direction of the vectors relative to the positive x-axis.
3. **Finding Minimal Angle**: The program iterates over pairs of vectors (considering only up to the first 100 vectors if \( n > 100 \)). For each pair, it calculates the angle using the dot product formula, which correctly computes the cosine of the angle between the vectors. The angle is then determined from this cosine value.
4. **Updating Minimum Angle**: The program updates the minimum angle and corresponding vector indices whenever a smaller angle is found.
5. **Output**: The indices of the vectors with the minimal angle are printed in 1-based index form.

The key issues to consider are:
- The sorting based on polar angles ensures that the relative order of vectors is maintained, which is crucial for finding the minimal angle.
- The use of the dot product to calculate the angle between vectors is correct.
- Considering only the first 100 vectors when \( n > 100 \) is an optimization, but it does not affect the correctness since the minimal angle should still be among the first 100 vectors due to the nature of the problem.

Given the above points, the program logically addresses the problem and should work correctly under the constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**
