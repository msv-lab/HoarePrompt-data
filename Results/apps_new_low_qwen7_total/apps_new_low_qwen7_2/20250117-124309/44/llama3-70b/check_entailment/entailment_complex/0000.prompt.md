Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given the set of vectors on the plane, each of them starting at the origin. Your task is to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them.

Non-oriented angle is non-negative value, minimal between clockwise and counterclockwise direction angles. Non-oriented angle is always between 0 and π. For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals to π.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of vectors.

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x|, |y| ≤ 10 000, x^2 + y^2 > 0) — the coordinates of the i-th vector. Vectors are numbered from 1 to n in order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).


-----Output-----

Print two integer numbers a and b (a ≠ b) — a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. You can print the numbers in any order. If there are many possible answers, print any.


-----Examples-----

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two parts: first, an integer n representing the number of vectors (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), and second, n lines, each containing two integers x_i and y_i representing the coordinates of the i-th vector (|x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10 000, x_i^2 + y_i^2 > 0). No two vectors share the same direction but can have opposite directions.
def func():
    n = int(input())

v = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        v.append((x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is an integer and greater than 0, v is a list of length 2n, x is the last input_x received, y is the last input_y received.
    ans = 0, 1

ans_angle = math.pi

v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
            angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v
                [i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))
            if angle < ans_angle:
                ans_angle = angle
                ans = i, j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n-1`, `j` is the index of `v` that gives the smallest angle with `v[n-1]` when `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is `(n-1, j)`, and `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found between `v[n-1]` and any other vector `v[j]` in the list.
    print(ans[0] + 1, ans[1] + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer \( n \) and then \( n \) pairs of integers \((x_i, y_i)\) from the standard input, representing vectors. It sorts these vectors based on their polar angles and then finds the pair of vectors with the smallest angle between them. The function outputs the indices (1-based) of these two vectors. If the number of vectors \( n \) exceeds 100, the function only considers the first 100 vectors for finding the smallest angle.
