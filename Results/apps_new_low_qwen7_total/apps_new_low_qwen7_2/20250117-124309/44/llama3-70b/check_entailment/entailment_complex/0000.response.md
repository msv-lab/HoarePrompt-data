Reasoning:

The provided annotated program attempts to solve the problem of finding the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of vectors \( n \) and then reads \( n \) pairs of coordinates \((x_i, y_i)\).

2. **Sorting Vectors**: The vectors are sorted based on their polar angles using `math.atan2(y, x)`. This ensures that the angles are sorted correctly and efficiently.

3. **Finding Minimal Angle**: The program iterates through the sorted list and calculates the angle between each pair of consecutive vectors (and the next 99 vectors to handle large \( n \)). It uses the dot product formula to calculate the angle between vectors. The dot product method ensures that the calculated angle is between 0 and \(\pi\), which aligns with the problem requirements.

4. **Updating Minimum Angle**: During the iteration, it keeps track of the pair of vectors with the smallest angle found so far. This is done correctly, ensuring that the smallest angle is recorded accurately.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the indices of the vectors with the smallest angle in a 1-based index format.

Given the provided code and the annotations, the program follows the correct approach to solve the problem. The key steps of sorting by polar angle and then calculating the angles between consecutive vectors are sound and address the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
