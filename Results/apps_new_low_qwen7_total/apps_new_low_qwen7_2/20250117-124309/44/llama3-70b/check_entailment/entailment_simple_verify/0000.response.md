### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine the correctness of the solution.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of vectors `n` and their coordinates.
   - The coordinates are stored in a list `v` as tuples of `(x, y)`.

2. **Sorting the Vectors**:
   - The vectors are sorted using `math.atan2(v[1], v[0])`. This effectively sorts the vectors in a counterclockwise manner around the origin.
   - Sorting is crucial because it helps in finding the minimal non-oriented angle by ensuring the vectors are in a sequence that makes it easier to compare adjacent pairs.

3. **Finding the Minimal Angle**:
   - The program iterates over all pairs of vectors `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
   - It calculates the angle between each pair using the dot product formula:
     \[
     \text{angle} = \math.acos\left(\frac{\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j}{\|\mathbf{v}_i\| \|\mathbf{v}_j\|}\right)
     \]
   - The dot product and normalization steps are correctly used to calculate the angle.
   - The program updates the minimal angle and corresponding indices whenever a smaller angle is found.

4. **Handling Non-Oriented Angles**:
   - The non-oriented angle is inherently handled by the calculation process. Since the angle is always taken between 0 and π, the minimal non-oriented angle is correctly identified without additional checks for clockwise or counterclockwise directions.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the example input:
     ```
     4
     -1 0
     0 -1
     1 0
     1 1
     ```
   - After sorting, the vectors are in the order: `(-1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, `(1, 0)`, `(1, 1)`.
   - The minimal non-oriented angle is indeed π/4 between `(1, 0)` and `(1, 1)`, and between `(1, 1)` and `(-1, 0)`.
   - The program correctly identifies these vectors and prints their indices.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimal non-oriented angle between any two vectors. The sorting ensures that the vectors are in a sequence that simplifies the angle comparison, and the use of the dot product and normalization correctly calculates the non-oriented angle.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the program correctly handles the non-oriented angle calculation through proper sorting and angle comparison.
