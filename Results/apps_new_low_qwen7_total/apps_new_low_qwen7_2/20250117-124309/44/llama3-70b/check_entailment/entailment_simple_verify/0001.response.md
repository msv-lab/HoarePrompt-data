### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Vector Representation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of vectors `n` and then processes each vector `(x, y)` by storing them in a list `v`. This part is correct.

2. **Sorting Vectors:**
   - The vectors are sorted using `math.atan2(v[1], v[0])`, which calculates the angle of each vector relative to the positive x-axis. This is a valid approach to ensure the vectors are ordered by their polar angles, making it easier to find the smallest angle.

3. **Finding Minimal Angle:**
   - The program iterates over pairs of vectors, but only up to `min(n, i + 100)`. This is an optimization to avoid unnecessary comparisons, which is valid since the number of vectors `n` is at most 100,000.
   - The angle between two vectors is calculated using the dot product formula:
     \[
     \text{angle} = \math.acos\left(\frac{\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j}{|\mathbf{v}_i| |\mathbf{v}_j|}\right)
     \]
     where \(\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j\) is the dot product of the vectors, and \(|\mathbf{v}_i|\) and \(|\mathbf{v}_j|\) are their magnitudes. This calculation is correct.
   - However, the angle should be calculated using the formula for the dot product divided by the magnitudes, and then taking the arccosine. The current implementation of the angle calculation might not handle all edge cases properly, particularly when vectors are nearly antipodal.

4. **Updating Minimum Angle:**
   - The program updates the minimum angle and corresponding indices whenever it finds a smaller angle. This logic is also correct, but it assumes that the angle calculated is the correct non-oriented angle, which might not always be true due to the potential precision issues with floating-point arithmetic.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the indices of the vectors found with the minimal angle, adjusted by adding 1 to match 1-based indexing as required by the problem statement. This is correct.

### Key Points to Consider:
- The use of `min(n, i + 100)` is an optimization but does not guarantee finding the global minimum angle, especially for very large values of `n`.
- The angle calculation using `math.acos` might not handle the precision issues well, leading to potential inaccuracies, particularly for nearly antipodal vectors.

### Annotated Version Analysis:
- **Initial State:** Input handling and vector representation are correct.
- **Sorting:** Correctly sorts vectors by their polar angles.
- **Angle Calculation:** The current implementation might not handle all edge cases, particularly near antipodal vectors.
- **Optimization:** Using `min(n, i + 100)` is an optimization but not necessary for correctness.
- **Update Logic:** Correctly updates the minimum angle and indices.
- **Output:** Correctly formats the output.

### Conclusion:
While the program generally follows the correct approach and logic, there are potential issues with floating-point precision and the optimization. To ensure robustness, the angle calculation should be handled more carefully, possibly by comparing the actual angles directly without relying solely on the dot product.

**Final: False**

The program might produce incorrect results in certain edge cases due to floating-point precision issues.
