### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Vector Representation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of vectors `n` and then processes each vector `(x, y)` by storing them in a list `v`. This part is correct.

2. **Sorting Vectors:**
   - The vectors are sorted using `math.atan2(v[1], v[0])`, which calculates the angle of each vector relative to the positive x-axis. This is a valid approach to ensure the vectors are ordered by their polar angles, making it easier to find the smallest angle.

3. **Finding Minimal Angle:**
   - The program iterates over pairs of vectors, but only up to `min(n, i + 100)`. While this is an optimization, it is not strictly necessary because the problem guarantees that no two vectors share the same direction. Therefore, the number of vectors will never exceed 100, and the optimization does not affect the correctness. However, this limit could be removed without changing the correctness of the algorithm.

4. **Calculating the Angle Between Vectors:**
   - The angle between two vectors is calculated using the dot product formula:
     \[
     \text{angle} = \math.acos\left(\frac{\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j}{|\mathbf{v}_i| |\mathbf{v}_j|}\right)
     \]
     where \(\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j\) is the dot product of the vectors, and \(|\mathbf{v}_i|\) and \(|\mathbf{v}_j|\) are their magnitudes. This calculation is correct.

5. **Updating Minimum Angle:**
   - The program updates the minimum angle and corresponding indices whenever it finds a smaller angle. This logic is also correct.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the indices of the vectors found with the minimal angle, adjusted by adding 1 to match 1-based indexing as required by the problem statement. This is correct.

### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary provided is consistent with the program's behavior. It states that the function sorts the vectors by their polar angles and finds the pair of vectors with the smallest angle. The summary also mentions that if the number of vectors `n` exceeds 100, only the first 100 vectors are considered. However, since the problem guarantees that no two vectors share the same direction, the number of vectors will never exceed 100 in practice, so this optimization does not affect the correctness.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct and follows the specified problem requirements accurately. The original assessment was accurate.

**Final: True**
