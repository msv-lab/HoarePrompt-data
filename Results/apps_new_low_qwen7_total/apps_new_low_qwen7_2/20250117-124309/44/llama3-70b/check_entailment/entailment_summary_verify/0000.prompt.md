You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given the set of vectors on the plane, each of them starting at the origin. Your task is to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them.

Non-oriented angle is non-negative value, minimal between clockwise and counterclockwise direction angles. Non-oriented angle is always between 0 and π. For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals to π.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of vectors.

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x|, |y| ≤ 10 000, x^2 + y^2 > 0) — the coordinates of the i-th vector. Vectors are numbered from 1 to n in order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).


-----Output-----

Print two integer numbers a and b (a ≠ b) — a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. You can print the numbers in any order. If there are many possible answers, print any.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
-1 0
0 -1
1 0
1 1

Output
3 4

6
-1 0
0 -1
1 0

- Program:
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    v = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        v.append((x, y))
    ans = (0, 1)
    ans_angle = math.pi
    v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
            angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))
            if angle < ans_angle:
                ans_angle = angle
                ans = (i, j)
    print(ans[0] + 1, ans[1] + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer \( n \) and then \( n \) pairs of integers \((x_i, y_i)\) from the standard input, representing vectors. It sorts these vectors based on their polar angles and then finds the pair of vectors with the smallest angle between them. The function outputs the indices (1-based) of these two vectors. If the number of vectors \( n \) exceeds 100, the function only considers the first 100 vectors for finding the smallest angle.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the non-oriented angle between vectors. Specifically, the program uses the dot product and the `math.acos` function to calculate the oriented angle between vectors, which does not directly give the non-oriented angle. Additionally, the program sorts the vectors using `math.atan2`, but it does not correctly handle the case where the sorted vectors might not be in the optimal order for finding the minimal non-oriented angle.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
-1 0
0 -1
1 0
1 1
```

The expected output is a pair of indices with the minimal non-oriented angle, which in this case would be (3, 4) since the angle between (1, 0) and (1, 1) is π/4, and the angle between (1, 1) and (-1, 0) is also π/4. However, the provided program might not correctly identify this minimal angle due to its approach to calculating and comparing angles.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to ensure that the angles are calculated considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions and then find the minimum non-oriented angle.
