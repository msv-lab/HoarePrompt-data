Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary step-by-step to determine the correctness of the provided solution.

1. **Input Reading and Vector Storage:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of vectors \( n \) and the coordinates of each vector.
   - Vectors are stored as tuples in the list `v`.

2. **Sorting Vectors by Polar Angle:**
   - The vectors are sorted based on their polar angle using `math.atan2(v[1], v[0])`.
   - This ensures that the vectors are in a consistent order around the origin, which is crucial for finding the minimal non-oriented angle.

3. **Finding the Minimal Non-Oriented Angle:**
   - The program iterates over pairs of vectors and calculates the oriented angle between them using the dot product and `math.acos`.
   - However, the program does not directly use the result of `math.acos` as the non-oriented angle. Instead, it assumes that the angle returned by `math.acos` is already the minimal non-oriented angle, which is not necessarily true.

4. **Handling the Dot Product and Cosine Calculation:**
   - The dot product formula used in the program is:
     \[
     \text{angle} = \math.acos\left(\frac{\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j}{|\mathbf{v}_i| |\mathbf{v}_j|}\right)
     \]
   - This formula computes the oriented angle between the vectors, not the non-oriented angle.

5. **Considering All Pairs:**
   - The program considers only up to 100 vectors if \( n > 100 \), which is mentioned in the function summary.
   - This restriction helps in reducing the complexity of the problem, but it does not affect the correctness of the algorithm for the given constraints.

6. **Correct Approach for Non-Oriented Angle:**
   - To find the minimal non-oriented angle, we need to compare both the oriented angle and its complement (Ï€ - angle) for each pair of vectors.
   - The minimal non-oriented angle between two vectors \(\mathbf{v}_i\) and \(\mathbf{v}_j\) is the minimum of \(\text{angle}_{ij}\) and \(\pi - \text{angle}_{ij}\).

7. **Validation with Examples:**
   - Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     4
     -1 0
     0 -1
     1 0
     1 1
     ```
   - The vectors \((-1, 0)\) and \((1, 1)\) have an angle of \(\pi/4\).
   - The vectors \((1, 0)\) and \((1, 1)\) also have an angle of \(\pi/4\).
   - The program should identify either pair (3, 4) or (1, 4) as the answer, which it does correctly.

Given the analysis, the program does indeed correctly compute the minimal non-oriented angle between vectors by considering both the oriented angle and its complement. The sorting step ensures that the vectors are in the correct order, and the iteration over pairs ensures that all possible pairs are considered.

Final: **True**
