### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Vector Representation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of vectors `n` and then processes each vector `(x, y)` by storing them in a list `v`. This part is correct.

2. **Sorting Vectors:**
   - The vectors are sorted using `math.atan2(v[1], v[0])`, which calculates the angle of each vector relative to the positive x-axis. This is a valid approach to ensure the vectors are ordered by their polar angles, making it easier to find the smallest angle. However, the sorting step itself is unnecessary because we can directly calculate the angles without sorting the vectors. Sorting can complicate the implementation and introduce potential off-by-one errors in the subsequent loops.

3. **Finding Minimal Angle:**
   - The program iterates over pairs of vectors, but only up to `min(n, i + 100)`. This is an optimization to avoid unnecessary comparisons, which is valid since the number of vectors `n` is at most 100,000.
   - The angle between two vectors is calculated using the dot product formula:
     \[
     \text{angle} = \math.acos\left(\frac{\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j}{|\mathbf{v}_i| |\mathbf{v}_j|}\right)
     \]
     where \(\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j\) is the dot product of the vectors, and \(|\mathbf{v}_i|\) and \(|\mathbf{v}_j|\) are their magnitudes. This calculation is correct.
   - However, the program uses `math.acos`, which returns the angle in radians. Since we need the non-oriented angle, we should directly compare the dot products to find the smallest angle without converting to radians and then back to the range [0, Ï€]. This can simplify the logic and reduce potential numerical errors.

4. **Updating Minimum Angle:**
   - The program updates the minimum angle and corresponding indices whenever it finds a smaller angle. This logic is correct, but the use of `math.acos` introduces unnecessary complexity. We can directly compare the dot products to find the minimal angle.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the indices of the vectors found with the minimal angle, adjusted by adding 1 to match 1-based indexing as required by the problem statement. This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the correctness of the program. However, there are minor optimizations and simplifications that could improve the clarity and efficiency of the code. The core logic is sound, and the program meets the problem requirements.

**Final: True**

This conclusion maintains the accuracy of the original assessment while noting areas for improvement.
