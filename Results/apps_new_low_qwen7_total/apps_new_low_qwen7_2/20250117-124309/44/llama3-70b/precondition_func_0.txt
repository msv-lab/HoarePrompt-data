The input consists of two parts: first, an integer n representing the number of vectors (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), and second, n lines, each containing two integers x_i and y_i representing the coordinates of the i-th vector (|x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10 000, x_i^2 + y_i^2 > 0). No two vectors share the same direction but can have opposite directions.
