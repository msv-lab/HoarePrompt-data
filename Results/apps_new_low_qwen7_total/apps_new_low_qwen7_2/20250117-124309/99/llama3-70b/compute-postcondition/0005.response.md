The code `print('NO')` does not affect any variables; it only prints a string. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers. The maximum of a1 and b1 is less than the maximum of a3 and b3, and the minimum of a1 and b1 is less than the minimum of a3 and b3; 'NO' is printed.**
