The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. The conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers. The maximum of a1 and b1 is greater than or equal to the maximum of a3 and b3, and the minimum of a1 and b1 is greater than or equal to the minimum of a3 and b3.**
