Functionality: **The function reads three pairs of integers (a1, b1), (a2, b2), and (a3, b3) from the standard input, where each integer is between 1 and 1000. It then checks if the pair (a1, b1) can "dominate" the pair (a3, b3) under certain conditions. Specifically, it checks if both the maximum and minimum values of (a1, b1) are greater than or equal to the corresponding values of (a3, b3). If (a1, b1) cannot dominate (a3, b3), it further checks if (a1, b1) can dominate (a3, b3) by replacing (a3, b3) with (a2, b2). If neither condition holds, it prints 'NO'. If (a1, b1) can dominate (a3, b3) in either scenario, it prints 'YES'. The function does not accept any parameters and has no return value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If (a1, b1) can dominate (a3, b3) directly, no further checks are needed.
- If (a1, b1) cannot dominate (a3, b3) directly, it checks if (a1, b1) can dominate (a3, b3) when (a3, b3) is replaced by (a2, b2).
- If neither (a3, b3) nor (a2, b2) can satisfy the dominance condition with (a1, b1), the function prints 'NO'.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer inputs or values outside the range [1, 1000]).
