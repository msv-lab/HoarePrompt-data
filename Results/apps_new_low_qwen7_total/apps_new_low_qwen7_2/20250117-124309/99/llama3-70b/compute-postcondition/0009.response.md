The code snippet `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console. However, this does not affect the values of the variables `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3`. The conditions regarding the maximum and minimum values of these variables also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are integers. Either max(`a1`, `b1`) < max(`a2`, `b2`) or min(`a1`, `b1`) < min(`a2`, `b2`). Also, max(`a1`, `b1`) is greater than or equal to max(`a3`, `b3`) and min(`a1`, `b1`) is greater than or equal to min(`a3`, `b3`).`**
