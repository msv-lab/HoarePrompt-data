The provided code snippet reads three pairs of integers from the standard input and assigns them to variables `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3`. However, since no input values are provided, we can only describe the structure of the final state based on the variables being updated.

Given the initial state where `a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3` are integers such that \(1 \leq a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3 \leq 1000\), after running the code, these variables will be updated based on the input values.

Since the actual input values are not specified, we cannot assign specific numerical values to these variables. Therefore, the final state will reflect the fact that these variables have been updated by the input.

Output State: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers, where each variable is updated based on the input values provided during the execution of the program**
