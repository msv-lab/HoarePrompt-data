Postcondition: ***`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are integers. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then no change is made to the variables. Otherwise, either `max(a1, b1) < max(a2, b2)` or `min(a1, b1) < min(a2, b2)` holds.***
