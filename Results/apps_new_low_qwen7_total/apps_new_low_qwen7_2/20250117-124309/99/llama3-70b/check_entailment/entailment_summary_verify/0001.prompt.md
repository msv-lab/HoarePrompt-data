You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Gerald bought two very rare paintings at the Sotheby's auction and he now wants to hang them on the wall. For that he bought a special board to attach it to the wall and place the paintings on the board. The board has shape of an a_1 × b_1 rectangle, the paintings have shape of a a_2 × b_2 and a_3 × b_3 rectangles.

Since the paintings are painted in the style of abstract art, it does not matter exactly how they will be rotated, but still, one side of both the board, and each of the paintings must be parallel to the floor. The paintings can touch each other and the edges of the board, but can not overlap or go beyond the edge of the board. Gerald asks whether it is possible to place the paintings on the board, or is the board he bought not large enough?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated numbers a_1 and b_1 — the sides of the board. Next two lines contain numbers a_2, b_2, a_3 and b_3 — the sides of the paintings. All numbers a_{i}, b_{i} in the input are integers and fit into the range from 1 to 1000.


-----Output-----

If the paintings can be placed on the wall, print "YES" (without the quotes), and if they cannot, print "NO" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2
1 3
2 1

Output
YES

Input
5 5
3 3
3 3

Output
NO

Input
4 2
2 3
1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

That's how we can place the pictures in the first test:

And that's how we can do it in the third one.

- Program:
def func():
    (a1, b1) = map(int, input().split())
    (a2, b2) = map(int, input().split())
    (a3, b3) = map(int, input().split())
    if max(a1, b1) >= max(a2, b2) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a2, b2):
        if max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads three pairs of integers (a1, b1), (a2, b2), and (a3, b3) from the standard input, where each integer is between 1 and 1000. It then checks if the pair (a1, b1) can "dominate" the pair (a3, b3) under certain conditions. Specifically, it checks if both the maximum and minimum values of (a1, b1) are greater than or equal to the corresponding values of (a3, b3). If (a1, b1) cannot dominate (a3, b3), it further checks if (a1, b1) can dominate (a3, b3) by replacing (a3, b3) with (a2, b2). If neither condition holds, it prints 'NO'. If (a1, b1) can dominate (a3, b3) in either scenario, it prints 'YES'. The function does not accept any parameters and has no return value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the given board and paintings can be arranged without overlapping. Here’s a detailed analysis of the logic in the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads three pairs of dimensions for the board and two paintings using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Logic for Arrangement:**
   - The program checks if the board can accommodate the largest dimension of the first painting (`max(a2, b2)`) and the smallest dimension of the first painting (`min(a2, b2)`).
   - If the board can accommodate the first painting, it then checks if the board can also accommodate the second painting in the same manner.
   - If the first condition fails, it directly checks if the board can accommodate the second painting.
   - This logic ensures that either both paintings can fit or only one of them can fit based on the given constraints.

3. **Handling Different Rotations:**
   - The program considers different orientations of the paintings by comparing `max` and `min` values. This is essential because one side of each painting needs to be parallel to the floor.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where the board might need to be larger to fit the paintings by checking both `max` and `min` values.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all necessary conditions to determine if the paintings can fit on the board. There are no apparent logical flaws or missing cases in the provided code.

### Correctness:

**True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the paintings can fit on the board based on the given constraints.
