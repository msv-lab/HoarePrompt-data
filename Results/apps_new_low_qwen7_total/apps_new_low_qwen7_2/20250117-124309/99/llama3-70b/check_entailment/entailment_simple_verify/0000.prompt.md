You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Gerald bought two very rare paintings at the Sotheby's auction and he now wants to hang them on the wall. For that he bought a special board to attach it to the wall and place the paintings on the board. The board has shape of an a_1 × b_1 rectangle, the paintings have shape of a a_2 × b_2 and a_3 × b_3 rectangles.

Since the paintings are painted in the style of abstract art, it does not matter exactly how they will be rotated, but still, one side of both the board, and each of the paintings must be parallel to the floor. The paintings can touch each other and the edges of the board, but can not overlap or go beyond the edge of the board. Gerald asks whether it is possible to place the paintings on the board, or is the board he bought not large enough?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated numbers a_1 and b_1 — the sides of the board. Next two lines contain numbers a_2, b_2, a_3 and b_3 — the sides of the paintings. All numbers a_{i}, b_{i} in the input are integers and fit into the range from 1 to 1000.


-----Output-----

If the paintings can be placed on the wall, print "YES" (without the quotes), and if they cannot, print "NO" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2
1 3
2 1

Output
YES

Input
5 5
3 3
3 3

Output
NO

Input
4 2
2 3
1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

That's how we can place the pictures in the first test:

And that's how we can do it in the third one.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3 are integers such that 1 <= a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3 <= 1000.

Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

If `max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3)` and `min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3)`, then this condition holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3)` and `min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3)`, and still `max(a1, b1) < max(a2, b2)` or `min(a1, b1) < min(a2, b2)` holds.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are integers. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then no change is made to the variables. Otherwise, either `max(a1, b1) < max(a2, b2)` or `min(a1, b1) < min(a2, b2)` holds.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the paintings can be placed by rotating them. For example, consider the following input:

```
4 2
2 3
1 2
```

In this case, the first painting (2x3) can be placed vertically (3 units tall), and the second painting (1x2) can be placed horizontally. However, the program does not check these possible placements, leading to an incorrect result. The correct approach would involve checking all possible orientations of the paintings and ensuring they fit within the board dimensions.
