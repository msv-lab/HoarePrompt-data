The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It then calculates the smallest number of additional elements (each equal to \( k \)) that need to be appended to the list to ensure that the average of the new list is at least \( k \). If the input values do not meet the constraints \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), \( 1 \leq k \leq 100 \), and \( 1 \leq a_i \leq k \), it will terminate without producing a meaningful result. If the constraints are satisfied, the function prints the number of additional elements needed and exits.
