Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the current average is already greater than or equal to \(k\) after adding just one more mark with value \(k\). In such cases, the program should stop and output 1 instead of continuing to increment the count unnecessarily.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 10
10 9
```

In this case, the current sum is \(10 + 9 = 19\) and the current count is 2. The current average is \( \frac{19}{2} = 9.5 \), and `math.ceil(9.5)` is 10, which is already greater than or equal to \(k\). Therefore, the minimal number of additional marks needed is 1.

However, the program continues to add marks until the condition is met, which leads to an incorrect result. The correct output should be 1, but the program outputs 2.

This demonstrates that the program does not handle this edge case correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
