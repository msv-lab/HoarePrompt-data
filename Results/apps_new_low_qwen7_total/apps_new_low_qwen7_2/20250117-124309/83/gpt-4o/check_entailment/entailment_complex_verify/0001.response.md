### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of additional marks to add such that the final average of all marks (including the new ones) rounds up to `k`.
   - Each mark is an integer between 1 and `k`, inclusive.
   - The final average should be rounded up to `k`.

2. **Current Average Calculation**:
   - The current sum of the marks is calculated as `current_sum`.
   - The number of current marks is `current_count`.

3. **Loop to Adjust Average**:
   - We use a loop to incrementally add the highest possible mark (`k`) until the average of all marks (current and new) rounds up to `k`.
   - The condition to check is `math.ceil(current_average) >= k`.

4. **Break Condition**:
   - When the average after adding the highest possible mark rounds up to `k`, we break the loop and print the difference between the final count and the initial count, which represents the minimal number of additional marks added.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code:

- **Initial Sum and Count**:
  ```python
  current_sum = sum(marks)
  current_count = n
  ```
  This correctly initializes the sum and count of the existing marks.

- **Loop to Adjust Average**:
  ```python
  while True:
      current_average = current_sum / current_count
      
      if math.ceil(current_average) >= k:
          print(current_count - n)
          break
      
      current_sum += k
      current_count += 1
  ```
  - The loop continues to add `k` to both `current_sum` and `current_count` until the condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` is met.
  - The loop is guaranteed to terminate because the average will eventually reach or exceed `k` by continuously adding `k`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The logic handles cases where adding just one more mark might already make the average round up to `k`.
  - The loop ensures that we do not add unnecessary marks beyond the minimum required.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **State Before Loop Execution**:
  - `current_sum` is the sum of the initial marks.
  - `current_count` is the number of initial marks.
  - `marks` is the list of initial marks.
  
- **State After Loop Execution**:
  - Example: `n = 2`, `k = 10`, `marks = [8, 9]`
    - `current_sum = 17`
    - `current_count = 4`
    - `current_average = 4.25`
    - Adding 4 more marks of `10` makes `current_sum = 27` and `current_count = 6`.
    - `current_average = 4.5`, which rounds up to `5` (not `10`).

### Correctness Analysis:

- The code correctly calculates the initial sum and count of marks.
- The loop increments the sum and count by `k` until the condition is met.
- The final output is the difference between the total count after adding marks and the initial count, which gives the minimal number of additional marks needed.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and correctly identifies the program as implementing the solution properly.
