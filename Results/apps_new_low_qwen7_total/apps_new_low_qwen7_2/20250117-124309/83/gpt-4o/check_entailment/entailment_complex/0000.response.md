Reasoning:

1. **Function Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the inputs `n` and `k` as integers and a list of `n` integers representing the marks.
2. **Current Sum and Count Calculation**: The initial sum and count of the existing marks are correctly computed.
3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop continues until the current average of the marks, when incremented by one more mark of value `k`, rounds up to `k`.
   - In each iteration, the current sum is increased by `k`, and the count is incremented by 1.
   - The condition to break the loop is `math.ceil(current_average) >= k`. This ensures that adding one more mark of value `k` would make the average at least `k`, causing the ceiling of the average to be `k`.
4. **Output**: The number of additional marks required (i.e., `current_count - n`) is correctly printed.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the current average might already be sufficient or where additional marks are necessary to reach the target average.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is sound and follows the problem statement correctly.

Correctness: **True**
