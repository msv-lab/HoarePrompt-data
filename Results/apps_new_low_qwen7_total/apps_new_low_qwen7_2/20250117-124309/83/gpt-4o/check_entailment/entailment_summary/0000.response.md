Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of marks `n` and the maximum possible mark `k` from the input.
2. It also correctly reads the list of marks `marks` from the input.
3. The program calculates the current sum of the marks and the current count of marks.
4. In the `while` loop, it continuously adds the maximum possible mark `k` to both the sum and the count until the condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` is met.
5. When the condition is met, the program prints the difference between the final count and the initial count (`current_count - n`), which represents the minimal number of additional marks needed.
6. The logic in the loop ensures that the average of the updated list of marks is at least `k`, and it minimizes the number of additional marks added by always adding `k`.

Given the explanation, the provided program should work correctly under the specified constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
