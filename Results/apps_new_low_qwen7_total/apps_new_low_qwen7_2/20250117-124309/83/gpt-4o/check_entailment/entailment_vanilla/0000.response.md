### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the minimum number of additional marks to add such that the final average of all marks (including the new ones) rounds up to `k`.
   - Each mark is an integer between 1 and `k`, inclusive.
   - The final average should be rounded up to `k`.

2. **Current Average Calculation**:
   - The current sum of the marks is calculated as `current_sum`.
   - The number of current marks is `current_count`.

3. **Loop to Adjust Average**:
   - We use a loop to incrementally add the highest possible mark (`k`) until the average of all marks (current and new) rounds up to `k`.
   - The condition to check is `math.ceil(current_average) >= k`.

4. **Break Condition**:
   - When the average after adding the highest possible mark rounds up to `k`, we break the loop and print the difference between the final count and the initial count, which represents the number of additional marks added.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles cases where adding just one more mark might already make the average round up to `k`.
   - The loop ensures that we do not add unnecessary marks beyond the minimum required.

### Correctness Analysis:

- The code correctly calculates the initial sum and count of marks.
- The loop increments the sum and count by `k` until the condition is met.
- The final output is the difference between the total count after adding marks and the initial count, which gives the minimal number of additional marks needed.

### Conclusion:

Given the explanation and analysis, the provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
