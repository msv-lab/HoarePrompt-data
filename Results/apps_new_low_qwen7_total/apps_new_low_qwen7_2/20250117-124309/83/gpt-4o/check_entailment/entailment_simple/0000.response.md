### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - The program correctly reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of `n` marks into the `marks` list.

2. **Current State Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial sum (`current_sum`) and count (`current_count`) of the marks.

3. **Loop to Adjust Average**:
   - The loop runs until the current average is at least `k`.
   - In each iteration, it increments the `current_sum` by `k` and the `current_count` by 1.
   - This ensures that the additional marks added are always the maximum possible (i.e., `k`), thus minimizing the number of additional marks needed.

4. **Rounding and Condition Check**:
   - The program uses `math.ceil` to round the current average up.
   - If the ceiling of the current average is at least `k`, the loop breaks, and the required number of additional marks (`current_count - n`) is printed.

5. **Output**:
   - The output is the minimal number of additional marks needed to achieve an average of at least `k`.

### Analysis:
- The logic in the program is correct for calculating the minimum number of additional marks needed.
- The loop continues to incrementally add the maximum possible mark (`k`) until the condition is met, ensuring the minimal number of additions.
- The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

The given annotated program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.
