### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of additional marks (each from 1 to `k`) that need to be added to Noora's existing marks to ensure her final mark rounds up to `k`.

2. **Current State**:
   - The program initializes `n` and `k` by reading them from the input.
   - It then reads `n` marks into the list `marks`.
   - The current sum of marks is calculated as `current_sum`.
   - The initial count of marks is `current_count`.

3. **Loop to Adjust Average**:
   - The loop continues to add `k` to `current_sum` and increment `current_count` until the average of all marks rounds up to `k`.
   - The average is calculated as `current_sum / current_count`.
   - The condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` checks if the current average, when rounded up, meets the requirement.

4. **Break Condition**:
   - Once the condition is met, the program prints `current_count - n`, which is the number of additional marks added.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the average might round up to `k` even if only one additional mark is added.
   - The loop ensures that the minimum number of additional marks is added.

6. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations**:
   - Initial state: `n = 2`, `k = 10`, `marks = [8, 9]`.
   - `current_sum = 8 + 9 = 17`, `current_count = 2`.
   - Loop execution:
     - First iteration: `current_average = 17 / 2 = 8.5`, `math.ceil(8.5) = 9 < 10`.
     - Second iteration: `current_sum = 17 + 10 = 27`, `current_count = 2 + 1 = 3`, `current_average = 27 / 3 = 9`, `math.ceil(9) = 9 < 10`.
     - Third iteration: `current_sum = 27 + 10 = 37`, `current_count = 3 + 1 = 4`, `current_average = 37 / 4 = 9.25`, `math.ceil(9.25) = 10 >= 10`. Breaks the loop.
   - Final output: `current_count - n = 4 - 2 = 2`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- The program correctly calculates the initial sum and count of marks.
- The loop correctly increments the sum and count by `k` until the average rounds up to `k`.
- The final output is the difference between the total count after adding marks and the initial count, which gives the minimal number of additional marks needed.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
