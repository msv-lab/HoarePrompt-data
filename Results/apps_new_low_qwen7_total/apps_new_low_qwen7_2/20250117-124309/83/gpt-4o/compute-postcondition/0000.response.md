The provided code block reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from input, followed by a list of `n` integers stored in the list `marks`. It then calculates the current sum of the elements in `marks` and initializes `current_count` to `n`.

Since the initial state values of `n`, `k`, and the list `marks` are not provided explicitly, we will assume generic values for `n` and `k` (both between 1 and 100) and an example list `marks` (a list of `n` integers between 1 and `k`).

Let's assume the following input for demonstration purposes:
```
5 3
1 2 3 2 1
```

- `n` is 5 (number of integers in the list).
- `k` is 3 (the range of the integers in the list).
- `marks` is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.

Now, let's execute the code with these inputs:

1. `n, k = map(int, input().split())`: This line takes the first line of input and splits it into `n` and `k`. In our example, `n` is set to 5 and `k` is set to 3.
2. `marks = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line takes the second line of input and converts it into a list of integers. In our example, `marks` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.
3. `current_sum = sum(marks)`: This line calculates the sum of all elements in the `marks` list and stores it in `current_sum`. For our example, `current_sum` becomes 9 (1+2+3+2+1).
4. `current_count = n`: This line initializes `current_count` to the value of `n`. In our example, `current_count` becomes 5.

Output State: **n is 5, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], current_sum is 9, current_count is 5**
