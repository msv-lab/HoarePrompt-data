The initial state is as follows:
- `n` is 5
- `k` is 3
- `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
- `current_sum` is 12
- `current_count` is 6
- `current_average` is 2.0

The code snippet to be executed is:
```
current_sum += k
current_count += 1
```

First, the line `current_sum += k` adds the value of `k` (which is 3) to `current_sum`. Since `current_sum` was originally 12, it becomes 15.
Next, the line `current_count += 1` increments `current_count` by 1. Since `current_count` was originally 6, it becomes 7.

The value of `math.ceil(current_average)` is not checked in this code snippet because the code does not contain the relevant conditional logic. However, based on the initial conditions, `math.ceil(current_average)` (which is `math.ceil(2.0)`) equals 2, which is not less than `k` (which is 3). Therefore, no additional conditions or variable modifications would occur due to this check.

No other variables are modified by this code snippet. The final state is:
Output State: **n is 5, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], current_sum is 15, current_count is 7, current_average is 2.0**
