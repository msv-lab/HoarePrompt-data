The code calculates the average by dividing `current_sum` by `current_count`. Given that `current_sum` is 15 and `current_count` is 7, the new value of `current_average` will be 15 / 7. 

The output state is: `n` is 5, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 15, `current_count` is 7, `current_average` is 15 / 7.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 15, `current_count` is 7, `current_average` is 15 / 7**
