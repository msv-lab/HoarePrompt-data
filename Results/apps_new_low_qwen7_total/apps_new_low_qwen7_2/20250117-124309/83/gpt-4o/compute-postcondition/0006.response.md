Output State: **n is 5, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], current_sum is 12, current_count is 6, current_average is 2.0**

Explanation:
- The first line `current_sum += k` adds the value of `k` (which is 3) to `current_sum` (which is initially 9), resulting in `current_sum` becoming 12.
- The second line `current_count += 1` increments `current_count` (which is initially 5) by 1, resulting in `current_count` becoming 6.
- The code does not modify the values of `n`, `k`, `marks`, or `current_average`.
- The condition `if math.ceil(current_average) >= k` is not met because `math.ceil(current_average)` (which is 2.0) is not less than `k` (which is 3), so the function does nothing further.
