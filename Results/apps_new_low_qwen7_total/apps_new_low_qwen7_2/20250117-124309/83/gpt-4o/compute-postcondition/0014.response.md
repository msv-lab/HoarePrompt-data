The first line `print(current_count - n)` calculates the difference between `current_count` and `n` and prints it. Given that `current_count` is 7 and `n` is 5, the output will be 2. However, this line does not modify any variables.

The second line `break` is not applicable here because we are outside of any loop or switch structure, so it does not have any effect on the variables.

Since no variables are modified by the executed code, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **n is 5, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], current_sum is 15, current_count is 7, current_average is 15 / 7**
