Output State: **current_count is 2, current_sum is 9, current_average is 1.8, n is 5, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]**

Explanation:
- The first line prints `current_count - n`, which is `5 - 5 = 0`. However, printing does not modify any variables.
- The second line contains a `break` statement, which is typically used in loops to exit them. Since there is no loop in this code block, the `break` statement does nothing and does not affect any variables.

Thus, the only variables affected by the code block are those that were already initialized in the initial state, and their values remain unchanged except for `current_count`, which is decremented by `n` (5) in the print statement's evaluation but not actually modified by it.
