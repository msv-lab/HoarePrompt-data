The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly stopped. Since there are no conditions in the loop head that control its execution, no adjustments to the states are necessary to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is 5, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 15, `current_count` is 7, `current_average` is 2.0**
