Postcondition: ***`n` is 5, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 15, `current_count` is 7, `current_average` is 15 / 7. If `math.ceil(current_average)` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function continues with the current state. Otherwise, the function also continues with the current state.***
