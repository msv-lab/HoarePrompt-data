The code calculates the `current_average` by dividing `current_sum` by `current_count`. Given the initial values, `current_sum` is 9 and `current_count` is 5, so `current_average` will be 9 / 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 5, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 9, `current_count` is 5, `current_average` is 1.8.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 9, `current_count` is 5, `current_average` is 1.8**
