The first line `print(current_count - n)` prints the value of `current_count` minus `n`. Given the initial state, `current_count` is 6 and `n` is 5, so the print statement outputs `1`.

The second line `break` is used in a loop context, but it is not inside any loop in this code snippet. Therefore, it will cause an error if this code were to run, but since we are focusing on the combined effect of all lines and not running the code, we can consider that it simply ends the execution without affecting any variables.

Output State: **current_count is 6, current_average is 2.0**
