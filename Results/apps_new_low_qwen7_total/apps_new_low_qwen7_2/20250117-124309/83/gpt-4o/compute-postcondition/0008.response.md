The code updates `current_average` by dividing `current_sum` by `current_count`. Given the initial values, `current_sum` is 12 and `current_count` is 6, so `current_average` becomes 12 / 6, which equals 2.0. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `marks`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 12, `current_count` is 6, `current_average` is 2.0**
