For the given `while True` loop, the loop will always execute as long as it continues to run without any condition to break it. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary since the loop will always proceed to the next iteration regardless of the current state values.

However, to follow the format requested:

State: **`n` is 5, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 12, `current_count` is 6, `current_average` is 2.0**
