Output State: **n is 5, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], current_sum is 18, current_count is 8, current_average is 18 / 8**

Explanation:
- The first line `current_sum += k` adds the value of `k` (which is 3) to `current_sum` (which is initially 15). This makes `current_sum` equal to 18.
- The second line `current_count += 1` increments `current_count` (which is initially 7) by 1, making `current_count` equal to 8.
- The variables `n`, `k`, `marks`, and `current_average` remain unchanged from their initial values since they were not affected by the executed code lines.
