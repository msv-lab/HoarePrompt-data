Let's analyze the given `while True` loop and the state of the variables right before the loop.

The loop condition is `while True`, which means the loop will always execute as long as the loop body does not explicitly break out of the loop. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any specific conditions related to the loop itself because the loop will always proceed to the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is 5
- `k` is 3
- `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
- `current_sum` is 9
- `current_count` is 5

Since the loop is `while True`, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed. The loop will start executing immediately upon entering the loop body.

State: **`n` is 5, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 9, `current_count` is 5**
