Postcondition: ***`n` is 5, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 12, `current_count` is 6, `current_average` is 2.0. If `math.ceil(current_average)` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function does not change any variables. If `math.ceil(current_average)` is less than `k`, the function also does not change any variables.***
