Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the initial set of marks does not contain any marks that can be used to measure either `x` or `y`. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that both `x` and `y` are measurable distances after adding the minimum number of marks.

Consider the following input:

```
Input:
2 300 185 230
0 300
```

The expected output should be:
```
2
185 230
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
0
```

This is because the program checks for the presence of `x` or `y` directly in the set of marks plus or minus the existing marks, but it fails to account for the fact that both `x` and `y` need to be measurable. The program needs to ensure that both `x` and `y` can be derived from the existing marks or newly added marks.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check if both `x` and `y` can be measured and, if not, add the necessary marks to ensure both distances are measurable.
