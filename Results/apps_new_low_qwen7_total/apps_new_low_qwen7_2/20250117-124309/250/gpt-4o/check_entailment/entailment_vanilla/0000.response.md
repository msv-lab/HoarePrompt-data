### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values and the marks from the ruler.
2. **Initial Check for `x` and `y`**:
   - The program checks if either `x` or `-x` (or `y` or `-y`) can be found as a difference between any two existing marks.
   - This is done using a set for efficient lookups, which is a good approach.
3. **Finding Missing Marks**:
   - If either `x` or `y` cannot be found, the program tries to find suitable marks to add.
   - It uses nested loops to check combinations of existing marks and potential new marks to see if adding them would allow measuring `x` or `y`.
4. **Output**:
   - If `x` and `y` can be measured, it prints `0` indicating no additional marks are needed.
   - If one or both of `x` or `y` cannot be measured, it calculates the necessary new marks and prints the count and the marks themselves.

### Verification:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the ruler already has marks that allow measuring `x` and `y`, the program correctly outputs `0`.
  - If the ruler does not have marks allowing `x` or `y`, the program tries to find the minimal set of new marks required. However, the logic in the nested loops might be too complex and could potentially miss some optimizations.
  - The program handles the case where the marks are not directly adjacent but still can form the required differences.

### Testing the Program:

Given the nature of the problem, let's test with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```
- Initial marks: `[0, 185, 250]`
- Checking for `185`: Already present.
- Checking for `230`: Not present.
- Adding `230` solves the problem.
- Output: `1 230`

#### Example 2:
```plaintext
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250
```
- Initial marks: `[0, 20, 185, 250]`
- Checking for `185`: Already present.
- Checking for `230`: Already present.
- No additional marks needed.
- Output: `0`

#### Example 3:
```plaintext
2 300 185 230
0 300
```
- Initial marks: `[0, 300]`
- Checking for `185`: Not present.
- Checking for `230`: Not present.
- Adding `185` and `230` solves the problem.
- Output: `2 185 230`

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code and verifying with the provided examples, the program appears to correctly handle the problem statement.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
