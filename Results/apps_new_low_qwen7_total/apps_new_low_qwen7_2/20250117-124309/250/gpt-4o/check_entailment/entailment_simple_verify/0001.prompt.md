You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values and the marks from the ruler.
2. **Initial Check for `x` and `y`**:
   - The program checks if either `x` or `-x` (or `y` or `-y`) can be found as a difference between any two existing marks.
   - This is done using a set for efficient lookups, which is a good approach.
3. **Finding Missing Marks**:
   - If either `x` or `y` cannot be found, the program tries to find suitable marks to add.
   - It uses nested loops to check combinations of existing marks and potential new marks to see if adding them would allow measuring `x` or `y`.
4. **Output**:
   - If `x` and `y` can be measured, it prints `0` indicating no additional marks are needed.
   - If one or both of `x` or `y` cannot be measured, it calculates the necessary new marks and prints the count and the marks themselves.

### Verification:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the ruler already has marks that allow measuring `x` and `y`, the program correctly outputs `0`.
  - If the ruler does not have marks allowing `x` or `y`, the program tries to find the minimal set of new marks required. However, the logic in the nested loops might be too complex and could potentially miss some optimizations.
  - The program handles the case where the marks are not directly adjacent but still can form the required differences.

### Testing the Program:

Given the nature of the problem, let's test with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```
- Initial marks: `[0, 185, 250]`
- Checking for `185`: Already present.
- Checking for `230`: Not present.
- Adding `230` solves the problem.
- Output: `1 230`

#### Example 2:
```plaintext
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250
```
- Initial marks: `[0, 20, 185, 250]`
- Checking for `185`: Already present.
- Checking for `230`: Already present.
- No additional marks needed.
- Output: `0`

#### Example 3:
```plaintext
2 300 185 230
0 300
```
- Initial marks: `[0, 300]`
- Checking for `185`: Not present.
- Checking for `230`: Not present.
- Adding `185` and `230` solves the problem.
- Output: `2 185 230`

After reviewing the code and verifying with the provided examples, the program appears to correctly handle the problem statement.
