Reasoning:

The annotated program has several issues and does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem correctly. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking `x` and `y`:**
   - The logic inside the `for` loop is checking for the presence of `mark + x` or `mark - x` in `marks_set` and similarly for `y`. However, this does not guarantee that we can measure both `x` and `y` with the existing marks.
   - The variable names and conditions are misleading and do not accurately reflect the problem requirements.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `new_marks`:**
   - The `new_marks` set is being used incorrectly. It should be used to store the minimum number of new marks needed to measure both `x` and `y`.
   - The logic for adding marks to `new_marks` is flawed and does not ensure that the minimum number of marks is added.

3. **Incorrect Output Handling:**
   - The program attempts to print the result without properly ensuring that both `x` and `y` can be measured.
   - The final output logic is incorrect and does not handle the cases where `x` or `y` cannot be measured with the existing marks.

Given these issues, the annotated program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
