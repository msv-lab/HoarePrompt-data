The function processes a strictly increasing sequence of integers `marks` and checks if there exist two elements `mark` in the sequence such that either `mark + x` or `mark - x` and `mark + y` or `mark - y` are also in the sequence. If such pairs are found, it prints `0`. If not, it tries to construct a new set of elements using `x` and `y` and prints `1` if successful. If neither condition is met, it prints the value of `x` or `y` based on which one was not found initially.
