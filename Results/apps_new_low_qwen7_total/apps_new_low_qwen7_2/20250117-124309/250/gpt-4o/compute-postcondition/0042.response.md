The code `new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. The variable `mark` is such that either `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`. Since `x` is a positive integer, `mark + y` will also be a positive integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is an empty list, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing the value `mark + y`.**
