Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `mark`, which comes from iterating over the `marks` list.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will iterate as long as there are elements in the `marks` list. The loop will execute the first time if the list `marks` is not empty.

3. **Initial States of Relevant Variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (this is given but not directly relevant to the first iteration).
   - `l` is a positive integer (this is given but not directly relevant to the first iteration).
   - `x` is a positive integer (this is given but not directly relevant to the first iteration).
   - `y` is a positive integer (this is given but not directly relevant to the first iteration).
   - `marks` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers.
   - `x_found` is `False`.
   - `y_found` is `False`.

4. **Ensure `marks` List is Not Empty**: For the loop to execute the first time, the `marks` list must contain at least one element. 

5. **First Element of `marks`**: The variable `mark` will take the value of the first element of the `marks` list during the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the `marks` list must have at least one element.

**Final State**:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `l` is a positive integer.
- `x` is a positive integer.
- `y` is a positive integer.
- `marks` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element.
- `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers.
- `x_found` is `False`.
- `y_found` is `False`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`**
