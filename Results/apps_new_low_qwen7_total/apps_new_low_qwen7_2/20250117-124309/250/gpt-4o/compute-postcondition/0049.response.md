The only object in the loop head is the variable `mark` from the `marks` list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `mark` to the next value in the `marks` list.

Given that `marks` is a list of positive integers and it is initially empty, the first value of `mark` should be the first element in the list after the initial iteration. Since `marks` was initially empty and now contains at least one positive integer, the next `mark` will be the second element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `mark` must be the next element in the `marks` list. Since the exact values in `marks` are not specified, we can only say that `mark` is the next element in the sequence.

State: **`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of positive integers (with at least two elements), `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, `mark` is the second element in the `marks` list**
