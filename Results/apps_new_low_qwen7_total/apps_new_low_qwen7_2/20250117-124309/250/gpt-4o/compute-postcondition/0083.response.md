Postcondition: ***`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of positive integers (with length `n`), `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `y_found` is True, and `new_marks` is a set of integers. If `new_marks` is not empty, 1 is printed and `new_marks` has one less element than originally. Otherwise, `x_found` is False, `new_marks` is an empty set, and the result is a list containing the value of `x`.***
