The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers with one less element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` is found in `marks_set`, `x_found` remains `True`. Otherwise, `x_found` remains `True`.**
