The given code consists of two print statements. 

1. The first `print(1)` statement outputs the number 1 to the console.
2. The second `print(new_marks.pop())` statement removes and returns an arbitrary element from the `new_marks` set, then prints this element to the console.

Let's analyze the effects of these operations:

- The first print statement (`print(1)`) does not modify any variables; it simply prints the number 1.
- The second print statement (`print(new_marks.pop())`) removes and prints an element from `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` is a non-empty set, it loses one of its elements after this operation.

Given that the initial state includes `new_marks` as a non-empty set, after executing the code, `new_marks` will still exist but will contain one less element than before. However, since we do not know which specific element was removed, we cannot specify which element was printed or what `new_marks` exactly contains afterward, but we know it has one fewer element.

Therefore, the output state will include the following updates:

- The number 1 is printed to the console.
- `new_marks` loses one element but retains its set nature and non-emptiness.

Final Output State: **1 is printed, new_marks is a set of integers with one less element than originally**
