Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is either `True` or remains `False`, `y_found` is `True`. If the condition `(x_found and y_found)` is true, the function does not change any variables. Therefore, the state of the program remains the same as the precondition.***
