`new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value of `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. Since `mark` is the next element in the list `marks`, and `y` is a positive integer, the value of `mark + y` is a specific integer. However, the exact value of `mark` and `y` is not given, so we will keep them in their symbolic form.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of positive integers (with at least two elements), `marks_set` is a set of integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, `mark` is the next element in the list `marks`, `new_marks` contains the element `mark + y`.**
