The code initializes a new empty set called `new_marks`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables such as `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, and `y_found`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is an empty list, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is an empty set.**
