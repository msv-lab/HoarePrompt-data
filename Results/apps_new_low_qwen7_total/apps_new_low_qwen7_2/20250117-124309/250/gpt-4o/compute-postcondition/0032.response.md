Postcondition: **`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is an empty list, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is an empty set. The current value of `mark` satisfies one of the following conditions: `mark + x + y` is in `marks_set`, `mark + x - y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`.**
