The code sets `y_found` to `True`. The condition for `x_found` being set to `True` was based on the presence of `mark + y` or `mark - y` in `marks_set`. This condition is now true, but it does not affect the value of `y_found`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is either `True` or remains `False`, `y_found` is `True`.**
