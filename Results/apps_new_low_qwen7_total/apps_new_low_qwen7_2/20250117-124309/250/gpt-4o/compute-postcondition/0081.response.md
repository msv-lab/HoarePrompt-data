Postcondition: ***`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of positive integers (with length `n`), `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `True`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is a list containing the value of `x`. Since the if condition is not satisfied (i.e., `y_found` is `True`), the `result` remains unchanged and the `y_found` status also remains as `True`.***
