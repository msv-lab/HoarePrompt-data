The code `y_found = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `y_found`. Since `y_found` was already `True` before this line of code, its value remains unchanged. All other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers with one less element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`.**
