The code `y_found = True` sets the variable `y_found` to `True`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state with `y_found` updated to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers with one less element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`.**
