Postcondition: ***`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is an empty list, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`. If `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `mark + y` is added to `new_marks`. Otherwise, if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `mark - y` is added to `new_marks`. Otherwise, `mark - x` is added to `new_marks` and the condition `(mark - x + y in marks_set or mark - x - y in marks_set)` must be true.***
