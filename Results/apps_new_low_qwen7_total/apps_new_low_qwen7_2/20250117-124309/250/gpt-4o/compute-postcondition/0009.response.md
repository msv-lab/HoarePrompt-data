The code `break` is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. However, since there is no loop or if statement in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values from the initial state are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is either `True` or remains `False`, `y_found` is `True`, and the condition `(x_found and y_found)` is true.**
