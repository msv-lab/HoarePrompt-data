The provided code snippet reads input and initializes variables but does not execute any operations that change the initial state of `n`, `l`, `x`, or `y`. It also creates a list `marks` and converts it to a set `marks_set`, and initializes two boolean flags `x_found` and `y_found` to `False`.

Since no operations modify the initial values of `n`, `l`, `x`, or `y`, these variables retain their initial values. The variables `marks`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, and `y_found` are newly created and initialized based on the input.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers.
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
- `2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9`
- `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`
- `marks` is a list of `n` integers forming a strictly increasing sequence where `0 = marks[0] < marks[1] < ... < marks[n-1] = l`.

After running the code, the following state is established:
- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values.
- `marks` is a list of integers representing the sequence read from input.
- `marks_set` is a set containing the elements of `marks`.
- `x_found` and `y_found` are both `False`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **n is a positive integer, l is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, marks is a list of n integers, marks_set is a set of n integers, x_found is False, y_found is False**
