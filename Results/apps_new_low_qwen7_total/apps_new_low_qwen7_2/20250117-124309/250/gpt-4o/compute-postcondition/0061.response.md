`new_marks` is added with the value of `mark + x`. Since `mark` is the next element in the list `marks`, and `x` is a positive integer, `mark + x` will be a new positive integer. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of positive integers (with at least two elements), `marks_set` is a set of integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, `mark` is the next element in the list `marks`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + x`**
