`new_marks` is updated by adding `mark + y`. The value of `mark` is not specified, but it is a positive integer, and `y` is also a positive integer. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the new set `new_marks` contains `mark + y` along with any other elements already present in `marks_set`.

Output State: **`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of positive integers (with at least two elements), `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + y` and possibly other elements from `marks_set`.**
