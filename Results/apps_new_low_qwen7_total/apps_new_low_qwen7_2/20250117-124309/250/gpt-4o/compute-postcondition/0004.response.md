Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is either `True` or remains `False`, `y_found` is `False`. If `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `x_found` remains unchanged.***
