The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the problem description, the function works with internal variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, which are positive integers with specific constraints: 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l. The sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) is a strictly increasing sequence of \(n\) integers where \(0 = a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n = l\).

Given the described output cases, the function likely processes these internal variables and returns a result based on the relationships between `x` and `y`.

Based on the given information, the function does not explicitly return any value but processes the sequence and conditions involving `x` and `y`. Since the function signature only includes `func()` without parameters, we should focus on the implicit parameters and their relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts implicit parameters n, l, x, and y as described, and returns a result based on the conditions 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l and the strictly increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n = l.**
