The code `result.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `result`. Since `y` was already in the list before and `y_found` was `True`, appending `y` again does not change the fact that `y` is already in the list. The value of `y` is appended to `result`, making `result` now contain both the original `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of positive integers (with length `n`), `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `True`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is a list containing the values `[x, y]`.**
