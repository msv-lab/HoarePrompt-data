Postcondition: ***`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is an empty list, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `False`. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + x`. Otherwise, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - x` and the condition `(mark - x + y in marks_set or mark - x - y in marks_set)` must be true.***
