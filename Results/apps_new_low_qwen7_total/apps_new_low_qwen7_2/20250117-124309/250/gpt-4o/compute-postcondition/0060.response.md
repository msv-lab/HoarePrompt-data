The loop head includes the variable `mark` which is iterated over the list `marks`. The other variables listed (`total`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks`) are not part of the loop head and their states will not be modified by the loop itself. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration is the value of `mark`.

Given that the loop iterates over `marks`, at the start of the next iteration, `mark` will be the next element in the list `marks`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over each element in the list `marks`.
2. The initial state has `marks` as a list of positive integers with at least two elements.
3. For the next iteration, `mark` will be the next element in the list `marks`.

Thus, the state to be adjusted is the value of `mark`.

State: **`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of positive integers (with at least two elements), `marks_set` is a set of integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, `mark` is the next element in the list `marks`**
