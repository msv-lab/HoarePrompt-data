Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, l is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, marks is a list of n integers, marks_set is a set of n integers, x_found is False, y_found is False
Code of the loop:
for mark in marks:
    if mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set:
        x_found = True
    if mark + y in marks_set or mark - y in marks_set:
        y_found = True
    if x_found and y_found:
        break


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is either `True` or remains `False`, `y_found` is `True`. If the condition `(x_found and y_found)` is true, the function does not change any variables. Therefore, the state of the program remains the same as the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers with one less element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition: `x_found` remains `True` regardless of whether `mark + y` or `mark - y` is found in `marks_set`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers with one less element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`. If `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no modification to the variables in either part of the if-else block, the values of the variables remain unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
