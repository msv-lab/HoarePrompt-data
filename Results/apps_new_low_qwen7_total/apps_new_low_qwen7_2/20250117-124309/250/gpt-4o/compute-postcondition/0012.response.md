`x_found` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `x_found` was either `True` or `False`, and now it is explicitly `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `l` is a positive integer; `x` is a positive integer; `y` is a positive integer; `marks` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element; `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers; `x_found` is `True`; `y_found` is `True`; and `marks` has one less element.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `l` is a positive integer; `x` is a positive integer; `y` is a positive integer; `marks` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element; `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers; `x_found` is `True`; `y_found` is `True`; and `marks` has one less element.**
