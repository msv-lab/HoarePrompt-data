The code `print(0)` simply prints the integer 0 to the console. This does not change the values of any variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is an empty list, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`.**
