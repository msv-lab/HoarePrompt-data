Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers with one less element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`. If `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, the function does not change the state of the variables.***
