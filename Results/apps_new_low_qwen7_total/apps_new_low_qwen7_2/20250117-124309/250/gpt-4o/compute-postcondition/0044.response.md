Postcondition: **`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is an empty list, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `False`, `mark + y + x` is not in `marks_set`, `mark + y - x` is not in `marks_set`, `mark - y + x` is not in `marks_set`. The current state is such that either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`.**
