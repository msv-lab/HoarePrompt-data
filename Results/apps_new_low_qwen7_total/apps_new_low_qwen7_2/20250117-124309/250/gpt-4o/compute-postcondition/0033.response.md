`new_marks` is assigned the value of `mark + x`. Since `mark` satisfies one of the conditions where `mark + x + y` is in `marks_set`, `mark + x - y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, the value of `mark + x` will be added to `new_marks`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is an empty list, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + x`.**
