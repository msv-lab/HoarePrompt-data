Postcondition: ***`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of positive integers (with at least two elements), `marks_set` is a set of integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, `mark` is the next element in the list `marks`. If `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `mark - y` is added to `new_marks`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
