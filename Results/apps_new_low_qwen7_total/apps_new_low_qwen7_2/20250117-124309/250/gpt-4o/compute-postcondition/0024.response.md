Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers with one less element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`. If `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no modification to the variables in either part of the if-else block, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
