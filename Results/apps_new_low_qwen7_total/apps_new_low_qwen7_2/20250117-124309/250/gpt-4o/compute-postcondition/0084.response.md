Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of positive integers (with length `n`), `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `y_found` is True. If `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, then the program does nothing. Otherwise, either `x_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is an empty set, and the result is a list containing the value of `x`, or 1 is printed and `new_marks` has one less element than originally.***
