Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers with one less element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition: `x_found` remains `True` regardless of whether `mark + y` or `mark - y` is found in `marks_set`.***
