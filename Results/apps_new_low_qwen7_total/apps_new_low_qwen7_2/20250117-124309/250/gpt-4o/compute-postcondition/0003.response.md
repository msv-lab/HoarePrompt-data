`x_found` is explicitly set to `True`, indicating that the condition for `x_found` being `False` no longer holds. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `False`.**
