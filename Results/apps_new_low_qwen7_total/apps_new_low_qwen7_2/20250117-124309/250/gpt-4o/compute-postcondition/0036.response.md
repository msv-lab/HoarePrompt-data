The code `new_marks.add(mark - x)` adds the value of `mark - x` to the set `new_marks`. Given that `new_marks` was initially an empty set, now it contains the value `mark - x`.

All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged. The condition `(mark - x + y in marks_set or mark - x - y in marks_set)` is still true, although it doesn't affect the current state since `mark - x` has just been added to `new_marks`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is an empty list, `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - x`, and the condition `(mark - x + y in marks_set or mark - x - y in marks_set)` is true.**
