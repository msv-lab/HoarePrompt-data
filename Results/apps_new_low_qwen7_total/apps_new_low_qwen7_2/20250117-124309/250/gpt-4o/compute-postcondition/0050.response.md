The code `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value of `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. 

- Initially, `mark` is the second element in the `marks` list.
- `x` is a positive integer.

After adding `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`, the set `new_marks` now contains the value `mark + x`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of positive integers (with at least two elements), `marks_set` is a set of `n` integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, `mark` is the second element in the `marks` list, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + x`**
