`count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` depends on the number of zeros in `year`. Since `year` is `a + 2` and `count` is 2 if the number of zeros in `year` was 1, otherwise `count` remains the same, `count` will now be 3 if it was initially 2, or it will remain 2 if it was already 2 (since adding one more does not change the value if it was already 2). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `year` is equal to `a + 2`, `count` is 3 if the number of zeros in `year` was 1 and initially `count` was 2, otherwise `count` is 2**
