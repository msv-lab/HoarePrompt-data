Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `year` is equal to `a + 2`, `count` is 3 if the number of zeros in `year` is 1 and initially `count` was 2, otherwise `count` remains 2.***
