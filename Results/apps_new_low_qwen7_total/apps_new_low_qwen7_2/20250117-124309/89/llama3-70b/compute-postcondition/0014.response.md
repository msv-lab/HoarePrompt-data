Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\). It iterates through all the years from `a` to `b` inclusive, counting the number of years that contain exactly one zero. After executing the loop, the function returns the count of such years. The function handles edge cases where `a` or `b` could be at the boundary values (i.e., \(1\) or \(10^{18}\)). However, it does not handle cases where `a` is greater than `b`, which would result in an empty range and thus a count of zero.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the function based on the provided code and annotations, including the iteration process and the condition checking for the presence of exactly one zero in each year within the specified range.
