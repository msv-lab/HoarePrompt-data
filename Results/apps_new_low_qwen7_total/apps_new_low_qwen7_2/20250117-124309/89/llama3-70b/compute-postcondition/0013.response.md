The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), and both are represented without leading zeros in their decimal form. The function returns a count, which is the total number of years between `a` and `b` inclusive that have exactly one zero.
