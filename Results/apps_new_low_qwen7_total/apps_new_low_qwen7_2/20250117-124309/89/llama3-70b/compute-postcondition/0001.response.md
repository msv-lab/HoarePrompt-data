The function `count_zeros` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18. The function returns the count of '0' bits in the binary representation of integer `n`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count_zeros` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return the count of '0' bits in its binary representation.
