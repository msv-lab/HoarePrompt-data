#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, and both a and b are represented without leading zeros in their decimal form.
def func_1(a, b):
    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `year` is equal to `b`, `count` is the total number of years between `a` and `b` inclusive that have exactly one zero.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of years between a and b inclusive that have exactly one zero
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\). It iterates through all the years from `a` to `b` inclusive, counting the number of years that contain exactly one zero. After executing the loop, the function returns the count of such years. The function handles edge cases where `a` or `b` could be at the boundary values (i.e., \(1\) or \(10^{18}\)). However, it does not handle cases where `a` is greater than `b`, which would result in an empty range and thus a count of zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18.
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')
    #The program returns the count of '0' bits in the binary representation of integer 'n' where 1 <= n <= 10^18
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `count_zeros` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\) (inclusive) and returns the count of '0' bits in the binary representation of `n`. This includes handling the full range of possible inputs, including the smallest (`1`) and largest (`10^{18}`) values. The function uses Python's built-in `bin()` function to convert `n` to its binary representation and then counts the number of '0' bits in that string. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need special handling beyond the natural constraints of the input range.
