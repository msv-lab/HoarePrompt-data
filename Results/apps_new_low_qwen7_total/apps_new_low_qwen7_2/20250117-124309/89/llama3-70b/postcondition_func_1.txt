The function `count_zeros` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\) (inclusive) and returns the count of '0' bits in the binary representation of `n`. This includes handling the full range of possible inputs, including the smallest (`1`) and largest (`10^{18}`) values. The function uses Python's built-in `bin()` function to convert `n` to its binary representation and then counts the number of '0' bits in that string. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need special handling beyond the natural constraints of the input range.
