### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task requires counting the number of years between two given years (inclusive) that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.
   - The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1(a, b)` and `count_zeros(n)`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`count_zeros(n)`**:
     - This function takes an integer `n` and returns the count of '0' bits in its binary representation.
     - It uses the `bin(n)` function to convert `n` to a binary string, which includes the '0b' prefix. The string is then split and the number of '0's is counted (excluding the '0b' prefix).
     - The logic is correct for counting zeros in the binary representation, but it does not handle negative numbers as the problem assumes positive integers.

   - **`func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function iterates through each year from `a` to `b` (inclusive).
     - For each year, it calls `count_zeros(year)`.
     - If the result of `count_zeros(year)` is 1, it increments the `count` variable.
     - Finally, it returns the `count`.
     - The logic is correct for counting years with exactly one zero in their binary representation.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The problem specifies that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\).
   - The solution correctly handles these constraints and iterates through the range inclusively.
   - The function `count_zeros(n)` is called for each year in the range, which is correct but might be inefficient for very large ranges due to the nature of the problem requiring a binary check for each year.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The provided solution correctly implements the required functionality.
   - It handles the specified range and ensures that each year is checked for having exactly one zero in its binary representation.
   - Although the solution is a brute-force approach, it adheres to the problem requirements and correctly implements the logic.

5. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The annotations confirm that the functions operate as expected within the given constraints.

Given that the logic and implementation of the provided code are correct according to the problem description, the correctness of the given program is:
