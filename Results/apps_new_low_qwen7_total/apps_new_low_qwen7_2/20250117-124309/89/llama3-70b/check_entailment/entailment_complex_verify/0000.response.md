### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to count the number of years within a given range `[a, b]` that have exactly one zero in their binary representation. The solution involves iterating through each year in the range and checking if its binary representation contains exactly one zero.

2. **Analyzed Code**:
   - **Function `count_zeros(n)`**: Converts the integer `n` to its binary representation using `bin(n)` and then counts the number of zeros in that binary string. This function is correctly implemented and handles all possible inputs within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: Iterates through each year from `a` to `b` inclusive and uses `count_zeros(year)` to check if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation. If so, it increments the count. The function correctly returns the count of such years.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, indicating that the functions handle the full range of possible inputs as required.
   - The overall description of the functions matches the intended functionality and the problem requirements.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles the boundary conditions appropriately (e.g., when `a` or `b` are at the limits of the range \(1\) or \(10^{18}\)).
   - The code also correctly handles the case where `a > b`, resulting in an empty range with a count of zero.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the code.
   - The annotations confirm that the functions behave as expected under all conditions specified in the problem statement.

Given the thorough analysis and the correct implementation of the functions, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
