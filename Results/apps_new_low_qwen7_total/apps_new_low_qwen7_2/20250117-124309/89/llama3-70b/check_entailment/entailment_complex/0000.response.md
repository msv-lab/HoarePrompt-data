Reasoning:

- The problem requires counting how many years within a given interval [a, b] have exactly one '0' in their binary representation.
- The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `count_zeros`.
- `func_1` correctly iterates over the range [a, b], calling `count_zeros` to check each year. If `count_zeros` returns 1, it increments the count.
- `count_zeros` converts the integer `n` to its binary representation using `bin(n)` and counts the number of '0' bits in the resulting string. This function correctly handles the full range of possible inputs (1 to \(10^{18}\)).
- Both functions handle the upper boundary value \(10^{18}\) appropriately. For example, \(10^{18}\) in binary is a very large number with many '1's and only one '0'.
- The solution correctly identifies that if `a` > `b`, the count should be 0, but since the problem guarantees \(1 \leq a \leq b\), this edge case is implicitly handled.
- There are no logical errors in either function, and they collectively meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
