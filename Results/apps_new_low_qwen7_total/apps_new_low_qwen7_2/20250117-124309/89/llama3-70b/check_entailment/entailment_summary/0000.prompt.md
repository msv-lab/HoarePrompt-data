 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input
2015 2015

Output
1

Input
100 105

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output
26



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(a, b))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):

    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\). It iterates through all the years from `a` to `b` inclusive, counting the number of years that contain exactly one zero. After executing the loop, the function returns the count of such years. The function handles edge cases where `a` or `b` could be at the boundary values (i.e., \(1\) or \(10^{18}\)). However, it does not handle cases where `a` is greater than `b`, which would result in an empty range and thus a count of zero.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `count_zeros` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\) (inclusive) and returns the count of '0' bits in the binary representation of `n`. This includes handling the full range of possible inputs, including the smallest (`1`) and largest (`10^{18}`) values. The function uses Python's built-in `bin()` function to convert `n` to its binary representation and then counts the number of '0' bits in that string. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need special handling beyond the natural constraints of the input range.
