Reasoning:
1. The main function `func_1` correctly iterates over the range of years from `a` to `b` inclusive.
2. For each year, it calls the helper function `count_zeros` to determine if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation.
3. If `count_zeros(year)` returns 1, the main function increments the count.
4. The functions handle the input constraints properly, including the edge cases where `a` or `b` could be at the boundaries of the range.
5. The logic of counting years with exactly one zero in their binary representation is correctly implemented.

Given the execution summaries and the logical structure of the functions, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
