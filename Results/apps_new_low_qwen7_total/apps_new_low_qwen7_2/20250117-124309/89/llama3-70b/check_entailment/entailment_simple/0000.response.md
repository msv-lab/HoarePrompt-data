### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of years within a given range [a, b] that have exactly one '0' in their binary representation.

2. **Input and Output**: 
   - The input consists of two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18).
   - The output should be the count of years between `a` and `b` inclusive that meet the condition of having exactly one '0' in their binary representation.

3. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1(a, b)` which iterates through each year from `a` to `b`, checks if the year has exactly one '0' in its binary representation using `count_zeros(year)`, and increments the count if true.
   - The function `count_zeros(year)` converts the year to its binary representation and counts the number of '0' bits.

4. **States and Logic**:
   - The program correctly initializes variables and iterates through the range `[a, b]`.
   - The logic for checking the number of '0' bits in the binary representation is correct.
   - The final count is returned as expected.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and state transitions are consistent with the problem requirements. The implementation correctly counts the years meeting the criteria within the specified range.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
