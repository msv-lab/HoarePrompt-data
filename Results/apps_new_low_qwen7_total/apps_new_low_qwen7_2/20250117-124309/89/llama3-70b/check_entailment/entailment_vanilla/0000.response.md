Reasoning:

1. The provided solution consists of two functions:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function aims to count how many years between `a` and `b` (inclusive) have exactly one zero in their binary representation.
   - `count_zeros(n)`: This helper function counts the number of zeros in the binary representation of an integer `n`.

2. The logic in `func_1(a, b)`:
   - It iterates through each year from `a` to `b`.
   - For each year, it calls `count_zeros(year)`.
   - If the result of `count_zeros(year)` is 1, it increments the `count` variable.
   - Finally, it returns the `count`.

3. The logic in `count_zeros(n)`:
   - It converts the integer `n` to its binary representation using `bin(n)`, which returns a string like `'0b1010'`.
   - It then counts the number of '0's in this binary string (excluding the '0b' prefix).

4. The solution correctly implements the required functionality:
   - It correctly identifies whether a year has exactly one zero in its binary representation.
   - It iterates through the entire range and counts such years accurately.

5. The solution handles the constraints provided in the problem (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18), although the brute-force approach may not be efficient for very large values of `a` and `b`. However, the problem statement does not specify any time complexity requirements beyond validity of the output.

Given that the logic and implementation of the provided code are correct according to the problem description, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
