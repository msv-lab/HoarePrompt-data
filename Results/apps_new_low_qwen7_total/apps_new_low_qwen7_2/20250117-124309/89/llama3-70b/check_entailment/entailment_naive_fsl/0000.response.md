Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of years within the given interval [a, b] that have exactly one zero in their binary representation. The function `func_1` iterates through each year in the given range and uses the helper function `count_zeros` to check if the binary representation of the year contains exactly one zero. 

The helper function `count_zeros` converts the number to its binary form using `bin(n)` and then counts the number of zeros using `.count('0')`. This approach ensures that the program accurately counts the years meeting the criteria.

Since the provided code handles the specified problem correctly for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
