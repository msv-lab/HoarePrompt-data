You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input
2015 2015

Output
1

Input
100 105

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output
26



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):

    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')



- Annotated Code: 
(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, and both a and b are represented without leading zeros in their decimal form.
def func_1(a, b):
    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `year` is equal to `b`, `count` is the total number of years between `a` and `b` inclusive that have exactly one zero.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of years between a and b inclusive that have exactly one zero

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18.
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')
    #The program returns the count of '0' bits in the binary representation of integer 'n' where 1 <= n <= 10^18




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The provided solution consists of two functions:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function aims to count how many years between `a` and `b` (inclusive) have exactly one zero in their binary representation.
   - `count_zeros(n)`: This helper function counts the number of zeros in the binary representation of an integer `n`.

2. The logic in `func_1(a, b)`:
   - It iterates through each year from `a` to `b`.
   - For each year, it calls `count_zeros(year)`.
   - If the result of `count_zeros(year)` is 1, it increments the `count` variable.
   - Finally, it returns the `count`.

3. The logic in `count_zeros(n)`:
   - It converts the integer `n` to its binary representation using `bin(n)`, which returns a string like `'0b1010'`.
   - It then counts the number of '0's in this binary string (excluding the '0b' prefix).

4. The solution correctly implements the required functionality:
   - It correctly identifies whether a year has exactly one zero in its binary representation.
   - It iterates through the entire range and counts such years accurately.

5. The solution handles the constraints provided in the problem (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18), although the brute-force approach may not be efficient for very large values of `a` and `b`. However, the problem statement does not specify any time complexity requirements beyond validity of the output.

Given that the logic and implementation of the provided code are correct according to the problem description, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
