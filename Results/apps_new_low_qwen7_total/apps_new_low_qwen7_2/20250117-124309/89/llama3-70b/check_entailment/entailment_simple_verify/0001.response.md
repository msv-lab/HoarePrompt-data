### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Logic**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function iterates through each year from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and uses the helper function `count_zeros(n)` to check if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation. If so, it increments the `count` variable.
   - `count_zeros(n)`: This function converts the integer `n` to its binary representation and counts the number of '0's in the binary string.

2. **Iterative Process**:
   - The for loop in `func_1(a, b)` iterates through each year in the range `[a, b]`.
   - For each year, `count_zeros(year)` is called, and if the result is 1, the `count` is incremented.

3. **Binary Conversion and Counting**:
   - `bin(n).count('0')` correctly counts the number of '0's in the binary representation of `n`.
   - This operation is efficient for individual numbers, but the overall complexity of iterating through a large range of numbers can be high, especially for large values of `a` and `b`.

4. **Input and Output Constraints**:
   - The input values `a` and `b` are constrained to be within \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\).
   - The function correctly processes these constraints and produces the correct output based on the given problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided examples cover different scenarios, including intervals with no valid years (`100` to `105`), a single valid year (`2015` to `2015`), and a larger interval (`72057594000000000` to `72057595000000000`).

6. **State Analysis**:
   - The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the state of the program before and after the function calls, validating the logic and ensuring that the count is updated correctly.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description. Although the approach may not be the most efficient for very large ranges, it is correct within the specified constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
