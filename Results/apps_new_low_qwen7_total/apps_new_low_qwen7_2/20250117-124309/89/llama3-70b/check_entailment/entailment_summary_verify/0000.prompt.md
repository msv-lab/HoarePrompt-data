You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input
2015 2015

Output
1

Input
100 105

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output
26



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):

    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `count_zeros` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\) (inclusive) and returns the count of '0' bits in the binary representation of `n`. This includes handling the full range of possible inputs, including the smallest (`1`) and largest (`10^{18}`) values. The function uses Python's built-in `bin()` function to convert `n` to its binary representation and then counts the number of '0' bits in that string. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need special handling beyond the natural constraints of the input range.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of years within the given interval [a, b] that have exactly one zero in their binary representation. The function `func_1` iterates through each year in the given range and uses the helper function `count_zeros` to check if the binary representation of the year contains exactly one zero. 

The helper function `count_zeros` converts the number to its binary form using `bin(n)` and then counts the number of zeros using `.count('0')`. This approach ensures that the program accurately counts the years meeting the criteria.

Since the provided code handles the specified problem correctly for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
