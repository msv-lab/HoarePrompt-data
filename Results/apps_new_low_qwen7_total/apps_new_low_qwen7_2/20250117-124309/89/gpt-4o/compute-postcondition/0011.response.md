Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `count` is the total number of integers between `a` and `b` inclusive that have exactly one zero in their binary representation, and `year` is `b + 1` (since the loop runs from `a` to `b` and increments `year` until it reaches `b`).**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each integer from `a` to `b` inclusive.
   - For each integer `year` in this range, it checks if the integer has exactly one zero in its binary representation using the function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(year)`.
   - If the condition is met, `count` is incremented by 1.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `year` starts at `a` and increments by 1 at each iteration until it reaches `b`.
   - `count` is initialized to 0 and is incremented based on the condition inside the loop.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After the loop completes, `year` will be `b + 1` because the loop runs from `a` to `b` inclusive and stops after processing `b`.
   - `count` will be the total number of integers between `a` and `b` inclusive that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop only increments `year` and updates `count` based on the condition, so no other variables are affected.
   - The final values of `a`, `b`, and `year` are as described, and `count` reflects the correct number of integers meeting the condition.

Thus, after the loop finishes, the output state is as stated above.
