Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), and `count` is 1 or 2 depending on the initial value of `count` and whether the binary representation of `year` (which is `a + 1`) has exactly one zero, where `year` is `a + 1`.***
