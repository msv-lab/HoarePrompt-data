Functionality: **The function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` accepts a positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) and returns `True` if the binary representation of `x` contains exactly one '0'. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function first converts the integer `x` into its binary representation using `bin(x)[2:]`, which removes the '0b' prefix. It then counts the number of '0's in the binary string. If the count is exactly one, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This function handles all valid inputs within the specified range and correctly identifies numbers with a single '0' in their binary representation.**

Edge cases and missing functionality included: The function correctly handles the edge case where `x` is 1, as its binary representation is '1', which contains zero '0's, thus returning `False`. Additionally, the function correctly handles the maximum value of `x` (10^18), ensuring it can process very large integers within the given range. There are no apparent missing functionalities in the provided code.
