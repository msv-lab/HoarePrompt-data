The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), and both are represented without leading zeros in their decimal form. The function returns `count`, which is the total number of integers between `a` and `b` inclusive that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, returns the count of integers between `a` and `b` inclusive that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.**
