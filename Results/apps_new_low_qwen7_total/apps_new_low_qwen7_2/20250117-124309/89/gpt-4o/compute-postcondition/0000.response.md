The code `binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]` converts the integer `x` to its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The value of `x` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18; `binary_representation` is the binary string representation of `x` without the '0b' prefix**
