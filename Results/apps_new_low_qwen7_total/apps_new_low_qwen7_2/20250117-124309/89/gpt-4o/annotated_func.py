#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, and both a and b are represented without leading zeros in their decimal form.

    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `count` is the total number of integers between `a` and `b` inclusive that have exactly one zero in their binary representation, and `year` is `b + 1` (since the loop runs from `a` to `b` and increments `year` until it reaches `b`).
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of integers between a and b inclusive that have exactly one zero in their binary representation
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\). It iterates through all integers from `a` to `b` inclusive and counts how many of these integers have exactly one zero in their binary representation. The function then returns the count of such integers. The function correctly handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are equal, and also handles the upper limit of \(10^{18}\). However, it does not handle the case where `a` or `b` are negative, although the initial condition specifies that `a` and `b` should be non-negative integers.

def has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(x):
    binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]
    return binary_representation.count('0') == 1
    #The program returns True if the binary representation of `x` contains exactly one '0', and False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` accepts a positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) and returns `True` if the binary representation of `x` contains exactly one '0'. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function first converts the integer `x` into its binary representation using `bin(x)[2:]`, which removes the '0b' prefix. It then counts the number of '0's in the binary string. If the count is exactly one, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This function handles all valid inputs within the specified range and correctly identifies numbers with a single '0' in their binary representation.
