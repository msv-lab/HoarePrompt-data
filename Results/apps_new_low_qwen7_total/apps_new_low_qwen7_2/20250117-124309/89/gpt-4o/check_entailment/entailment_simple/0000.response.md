Reasoning:

1. The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It reads the input, iterates through each year in the given range, checks if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation, and counts how many such years exist within the range.

2. The function `func_1` takes the start and end of the interval as parameters and iterates through each year in the range. For each year, it calls the helper function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` to check if the year meets the criteria. If it does, it increments the count.

3. The function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` correctly converts the year to its binary representation and checks if there is exactly one '0' in the binary string. This is done by counting the occurrences of '0' in the binary representation and returning `True` if the count is exactly one, and `False` otherwise.

4. The program correctly handles the constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), and the logic is sound and complete for the problem statement.

5. The provided example tests and the logical flow of the code match the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
