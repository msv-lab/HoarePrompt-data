Reasoning:
- The given solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`.
- `func_1` iterates through each year in the range `[a, b]` and checks if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation using the `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` function.
- `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` correctly determines whether a given number's binary representation contains exactly one '0'.
- Both functions handle the input constraints appropriately (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18), and there are no logical errors in either function.
- The overall logic of counting the years with exactly one zero in their binary representation from `a` to `b` is correct.
- There is no issue with negative inputs since the problem guarantees non-negative integers, and the code does not handle invalid inputs beyond this constraint.

Given the above analysis, the program is correct according to the problem statement and the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**
