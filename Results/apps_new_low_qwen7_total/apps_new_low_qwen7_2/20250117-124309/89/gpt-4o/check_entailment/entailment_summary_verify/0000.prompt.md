You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input
2015 2015

Output
1

Input
100 105

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output
26



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):

    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(year):
            count += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(x):
    binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]
    return binary_representation.count('0') == 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` accepts a positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) and returns `True` if the binary representation of `x` contains exactly one '0'. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function first converts the integer `x` into its binary representation using `bin(x)[2:]`, which removes the '0b' prefix. It then counts the number of '0's in the binary string. If the count is exactly one, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This function handles all valid inputs within the specified range and correctly identifies numbers with a single '0' in their binary representation.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm and instead uses a brute-force approach to check each year in the given range. This approach works fine for small ranges but is inefficient for large ranges, especially those as large as \(10^{18}\).

However, to strictly adhere to the format and the instructions provided:

- The program uses a brute-force method (`func_1`) to iterate through each year in the range `[a, b]` and checks if it has exactly one zero in its binary representation using `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`.
- This method will work correctly for the given examples and for most cases within the constraints, but it does not efficiently handle very large ranges due to its O(n) complexity.

Since the problem description requires finding the number of years with exactly one zero in their binary representation in a given interval, the provided solution does not meet the requirement efficiently. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the given problem description.
