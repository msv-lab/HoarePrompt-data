Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm and instead uses a brute-force approach to check each year in the given range. This approach works fine for small ranges but is inefficient for large ranges, especially those as large as \(10^{18}\).

However, to strictly adhere to the format and the instructions provided:

- The program uses a brute-force method (`func_1`) to iterate through each year in the range `[a, b]` and checks if it has exactly one zero in its binary representation using `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`.
- This method will work correctly for the given examples and for most cases within the constraints, but it does not efficiently handle very large ranges due to its O(n) complexity.

Since the problem description requires finding the number of years with exactly one zero in their binary representation in a given interval, the provided solution does not meet the requirement efficiently. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the given problem description.
