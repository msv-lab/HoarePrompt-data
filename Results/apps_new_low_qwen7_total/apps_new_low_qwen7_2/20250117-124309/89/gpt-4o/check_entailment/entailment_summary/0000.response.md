Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function iterates through each year from `a` to `b` inclusive and uses the `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(year)` function to check if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation. If it does, it increments the count. This approach ensures that all years in the interval are checked.
2. **Function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(x)`**: This function correctly determines whether a given number has exactly one '0' in its binary representation. It does this by converting the number to its binary form and counting the '0's. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified range and correctly identifies the numbers with a single '0' in their binary representation.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` are equal, as it checks every integer in the range, including the endpoints.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` also correctly handles the upper limit of \(10^{18}\).
4. **Input Validation**: Although the problem statement specifies that `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, the implementation does not explicitly validate these conditions. However, since the provided test cases assume valid inputs and the problem constraints are met, this can be considered an acceptable omission in this context.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the required functionality and handle all the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
