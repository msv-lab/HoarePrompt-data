The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\). It iterates through all integers from `a` to `b` inclusive and counts how many of these integers have exactly one zero in their binary representation. The function then returns the count of such integers. The function correctly handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are equal, and also handles the upper limit of \(10^{18}\). However, it does not handle the case where `a` or `b` are negative, although the initial condition specifies that `a` and `b` should be non-negative integers.
