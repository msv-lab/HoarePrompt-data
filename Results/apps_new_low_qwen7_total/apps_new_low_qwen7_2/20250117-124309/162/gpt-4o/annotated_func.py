#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).
def func_1(x):
    return x & x + 1 == 0
    #The program returns False because there is no integer x in the range 1 to 10^6 such that x & (x + 1) equals 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` as a parameter, where \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\). It then checks whether the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `x + 1` results in `0`. Since no integer within the specified range satisfies the condition `x & (x + 1) == 0`, the function always returns `False`. This behavior holds true for all integers in the given range, including edge cases like the minimum value `1` and the maximum value `10^6`.

    while not func_1(x) and count < 40:
        if count % 2 == 0:
            n = 0
            while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
                n += 1
            while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
                n -= 1
            if n == 0:
                break
            operations.append(n)
            x ^= (1 << n) - 1
        else:
            x += 1
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` is less than 41, `x` is an integer, and `func_1(x)` returns `False`. If `count % 2 == 0`, then `x` is the result of performing the XOR operation with `(1 << n) - 1` for each `n` in `operations`, and `n` is the last value appended to `operations`. If `count % 2 != 0`, then `x` is its original value plus 1, and `n` is 0.
    return count, operations
    #`count` is less than 41 and `operations` is a list where the value of `x` is determined based on the conditions given, the function `func_1(x)` returns False, and the final `x` is returned as part of the tuple along with `count`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\). It iteratively modifies `x` based on certain conditions until either `func_1(x)` returns `True` (which stops the iteration) or `count` reaches 40. During each iteration, if `count` is even, it performs a series of operations involving bitwise manipulations to modify `x` and records these operations in the `operations` list. If `count` is odd, it simply increments `x` by 1. After the loop, the function returns a tuple containing the final value of `x` and the count of iterations performed. If `func_1(x)` returns `False`, the final value of `x` is returned as part of the tuple along with the count. If `func_1(x)` returns `True`, the function still returns a tuple with the final `x` and count. If `count` reaches 40 without `func_1(x)` returning `True`, the function also returns a tuple with the final `x` and count.
