You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Cat Furrier Transform is a popular algorithm among cat programmers to create longcats. As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.

Assume that we have a cat with a number $x$. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.

In the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. 

The first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.

Neko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?

Note that it is not required to minimize the number of operations. You just need to use no more than $40$ operations.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le 10^6$).


-----Output-----

The first line should contain a single integer $t$ ($0 \le t \le 40$) — the number of operations to apply.

Then for each odd-numbered operation print the corresponding number $n_i$ in it. That is, print $\lceil \frac{t}{2} \rceil$ integers $n_i$ ($0 \le n_i \le 30$), denoting the replacement $x$ with $x \oplus (2^{n_i} - 1)$ in the corresponding step.

If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them. It is possible to show, that there is at least one answer in the constraints of this problem.

-----Note-----

In the first test, one of the transforms might be as follows: $39 \to 56 \to 57 \to 62 \to 63$. Or more precisely: Pick $n = 5$. $x$ is transformed into $39 \oplus 31$, or $56$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $57$.  Pick $n = 3$. $x$ is transformed into $57 \oplus 7$, or $62$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $63 = 2^6 - 1$. 

In the second and third test, the number already satisfies the goal requirement.

    return x & x + 1 == 0

#Function 2:
def func_2(x):
    operations = []
    count = 0
    while not func_1(x) and count < 40:

            n = 0
            while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
                n += 1
            while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
                n -= 1
            if n == 0:
                break
            operations.append(n)
            x ^= (1 << n) - 1
        else:
            x += 1
        count += 1
    return (count, operations)



- Annotated Code: 
x = int(input())
(t, ops) = func_2(x)
print(t)
for i in range(0, len(ops), 2):
    print(ops[i], end=' ')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).
def func_1(x):
    return x & x + 1 == 0
    #The program returns False because there is no integer x in the range 1 to 10^6 such that x & (x + 1) equals 0

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6.
def func_2(x):
    operations = []

count = 0
    while not func_1(x) and count < 40:
        if count % 2 == 0:
            n = 0
            while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
                n += 1
            while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:

            x ^= (1 << n) - 1
        else:
            x += 1
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` is less than 41, `x` is an integer, and `func_1(x)` returns `False`. If `count % 2 == 0`, then `x` is the result of performing the XOR operation with `(1 << n) - 1` for each `n` in `operations`, and `n` is the last value appended to `operations`. If `count % 2 != 0`, then `x` is its original value plus 1, and `n` is 0.
    return count, operations
    #`count` is less than 41 and `operations` is a list where the value of `x` is determined based on the conditions given, the function `func_1(x)` returns False, and the final `x` is returned as part of the tuple along with `count`




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the Cat Furrier Transform according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initial Check**: The `func_1` function checks if the current value of `x` is a perfect longcat by verifying if `x & x + 1 == 0`. This condition holds true for numbers of the form \(2^m - 1\).

2. **Transformation Logic**:
   - For odd-numbered operations (type A), the program finds the highest bit set in `x` and applies the XOR operation to clear that bit.
   - For even-numbered operations (type B), the program simply increments `x` by 1.
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes a perfect longcat or until 40 operations are performed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the initial `x` is already a perfect longcat, the function returns immediately without performing any operations, which aligns with the problem statement.
   - The program ensures that it performs no more than 40 operations, as required.

Given these points, the program handles all potential cases correctly and meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
