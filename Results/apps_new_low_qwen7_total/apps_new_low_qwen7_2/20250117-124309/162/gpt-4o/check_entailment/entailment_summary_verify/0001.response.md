### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function correctly checks if `x` is of the form \(2^m - 1\). The condition `x & (x + 1) == 0` ensures that all bits in `x` are set to 1, meaning it is one less than a power of 2.
- This function is implemented accurately.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function aims to transform `x` into a perfect longcat using the specified operations and ensures the operations are applied in the correct alternating order.
- The function correctly initializes `operations` and `count`.
- The loop runs until `func_1(x)` returns `True` or `count` reaches 40.
- Inside the loop:
  - For odd-numbered operations (when `count % 2 == 0`), it identifies the highest bit set in `x` and performs the XOR operation with \(2^n - 1\).
  - For even-numbered operations (when `count % 2 != 0`), it simply increments `x` by 1.
- The function correctly collects the values of `n` used in Operation A and returns the total number of operations and the list of `n` values.

However, there is a critical issue in the implementation of the `while` loop within the `if count % 2 == 0:` block:

```python
n = 0
while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
    n += 1
while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
    n -= 1
```

- The first `while` loop increments `n` until \(2^n - 1\) exceeds `x`. This is incorrect because it will find the highest bit set to 1 in `x`, but it does not necessarily find the highest bit that can be cleared to make `x` a perfect longcat.
- The second `while` loop tries to find the highest bit that can be cleared, but it does not guarantee that `x` will become a perfect longcat after the XOR operation. This approach can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider `x = 39`:
- The first `while` loop will find that the highest bit set in `39` is \(2^5 - 1 = 31\), so `n` is set to 5.
- The second `while` loop will not change `n` because `39 >> 4 & 1 == 1`, so `n` remains 5.
- The XOR operation `x ^= (1 << 5) - 1` will result in `x = 56`.
- The next even operation `x += 1` will result in `x = 57`.
- The next odd operation will find the highest bit set in `57` as \(2^5 - 1 = 31\), leading to `x = 88`, and so on, which may not lead to a perfect longcat.

This logic is flawed and may not always transform `x` into a perfect longcat within the allowed operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the above reasoning, the provided Python program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in identifying and clearing the appropriate bits.

Final: **False**
