Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it step-by-step based on the problem requirements.

### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if `x` is of the form \(2^m - 1\). Specifically, it checks if \(x \& (x + 1) == 0\). This is a common way to check if a number has all bits set to 1, which means it is one less than a power of 2.
- The function is correctly implemented to determine if `x` is a perfect longcat.

### Function `func_2`:
- This function performs the Cat Furrier Transform as described. It alternates between applying Operation A and Operation B, ensuring the sequence of operations is correct.
- The function uses a `while` loop to continue transforming `x` until it becomes a perfect longcat or until the maximum number of operations (40) is reached.
- Inside the loop:
  - For odd-numbered operations, it finds the highest bit set in `x` and applies the XOR operation with \(2^n - 1\) where \(n\) is the position of that bit.
  - For even-numbered operations, it simply increments `x` by 1.
- It collects the values of `n` used in Operation A and returns the total number of operations and the list of `n` values.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The function starts with the correct initial conditions and follows the specified rules for alternating between Operation A and Operation B.
2. **Termination**: The loop terminates either when `x` becomes a perfect longcat or when the maximum number of operations (40) is reached.
3. **Correct Operations**: The operations are correctly applied in the specified order (A, B, A, B, ...).
4. **Output Format**: The function outputs the number of operations and the list of `n` values, which matches the required output format.

Given the analysis, the provided Python program correctly implements the Cat Furrier Transform according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
