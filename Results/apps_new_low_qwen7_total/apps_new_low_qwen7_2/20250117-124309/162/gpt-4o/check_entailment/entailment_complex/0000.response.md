### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to check if \( x \) is of the form \( 2^m - 1 \) for some non-negative integer \( m \). However, as mentioned, the function always returns `False` because no integer in the range \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^6 \) satisfies \( x \& (x + 1) == 0 \).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function implements the Cat Furrier Transform as described. It performs operations based on the given rules and constraints.
   - The logic inside `func_2` correctly implements the operations:
     - If `count % 2 == 0`, it finds the largest \( n \) such that \( (1 << n) - 1 \leq x \) and applies the XOR operation \( x \oplus (2^n - 1) \).
     - If `count % 2 != 0`, it increments \( x \) by 1.
   - The function ensures that no more than 40 operations are performed and returns the count and the sequence of operations.
   - Given the problem constraints and the nature of the operations, the function should correctly transform \( x \) into a perfect longcat (i.e., \( 2^m - 1 \)) if possible within 40 operations.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program calls `func_2(x)` and prints the number of operations and the sequence of operations if needed.
   - The program handles the output format correctly by printing the count and the operations in the required manner.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the Cat Furrier Transform according to the problem statement. It adheres to the constraints and performs the required operations efficiently.
