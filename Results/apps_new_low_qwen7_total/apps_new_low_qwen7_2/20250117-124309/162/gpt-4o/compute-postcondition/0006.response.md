Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `(1 << n) - 1 <= x`.
2. **Current values**: 
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`.
   - `count` is even.
   - `n` is 1.

3. **Determine the current state of the loop condition**:
   - When `n` is 1, the loop condition becomes \((1 << 1) - 1 = 1\).
   - Since `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\), the condition \((1 << 1) - 1 \leq x\) is always true for any valid `x`.

Given that the loop condition is always true when `n` is 1, we need to consider how to proceed to the next iteration. The only variable that can be adjusted is `n`.

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - To proceed to the next iteration, `n` must be incremented by 1, making it `n = 2`.
   - This is because the loop condition checks if \((1 << n) - 1 \leq x\). For the next iteration, `n` should be increased to ensure the loop continues.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`; `count` is even; `n` must be 2**
