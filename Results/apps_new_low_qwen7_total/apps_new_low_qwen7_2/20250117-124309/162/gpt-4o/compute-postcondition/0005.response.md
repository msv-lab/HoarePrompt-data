The code `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Initially, `n` is 0, so after executing the code, `n` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`x` and `count`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`; `count` is even; `n` is 1.
