To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions and the loop itself.

### Given Conditions:
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\)
- `func_1(x)` returns `False`
- `count` is even
- `n` is 0

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is \((1 << n) - 1 \leq x\).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `n`:**
   - Before the loop, `n` is 0.
   - Substituting `n = 0` into the loop condition, we get \((1 << 0) - 1 \leq x\).
   - Since \(1 << 0\) is 1, the condition becomes \(1 - 1 \leq x\) or \(0 \leq x\).
   - Given that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\), this condition is always true.

2. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - The loop will execute as long as \((1 << n) - 1 \leq x\) holds true.
   - For \(n = 0\), the condition simplifies to \(0 \leq x\), which is always true given \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).
   - Therefore, the loop will definitely execute at least once because the condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop condition is already satisfied with `n = 0`, no changes are necessary to ensure the loop executes the first time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`; `count` is even; `n` is 0**
