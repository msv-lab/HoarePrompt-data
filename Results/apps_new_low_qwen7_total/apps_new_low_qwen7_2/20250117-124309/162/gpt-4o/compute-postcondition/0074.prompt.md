Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6, operations is an empty list, count is 0
Code of the loop:
while not func_1(x) and count < 40:
    if count % 2 == 0:
        n = 0
        while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
            n += 1
        while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
            n -= 1
        if n == 0:
            break
        operations.append(n)
        x ^= (1 << n) - 1
    else:
        x += 1
    count += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\); if `count % 2 == 0`, then `x` is -1 and `n` is 0, otherwise `x` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`; `count` is increased by 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `count` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial state is `count` is less than 40, and considering that `count % 2 == 0` leads to a specific calculation for `x` while `count % 2 != 0` results in adding 1 to the original value of `x`, the new value of `count` does not directly impact the value of `x` unless `count` meets the condition `count % 2 == 0`.

Since the initial state also mentions that `func_1(x)` returns `False`, this function's return value remains unchanged.

The Output State is: **`count` is less than 41, and `x` is an integer; `func_1(x)` returns `False`. If `count % 2 == 0`, then `x` is the result of performing the XOR operation with `(1 << n) - 1` for each `n` in `operations`, and `n` is the last value appended to `operations`. If `count % 2 != 0`, then `x` is its original value plus 1, and `n` is 0.**
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `count` is `count + 1` and `count` is less than 42


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
