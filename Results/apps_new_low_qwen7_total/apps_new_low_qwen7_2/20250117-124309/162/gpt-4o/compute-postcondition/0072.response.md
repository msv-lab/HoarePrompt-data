Postcondition: **`count` is less than 41. If `(count + 1) % 2 == 0`, then `x` remains the same as its initial value, `n` is the last value appended to `operations`, and `count` is incremented by 1. If `(count + 1) % 2 != 0`, then `x` is its original value plus 1, `n` is 0, and `count` is incremented by 1.**
