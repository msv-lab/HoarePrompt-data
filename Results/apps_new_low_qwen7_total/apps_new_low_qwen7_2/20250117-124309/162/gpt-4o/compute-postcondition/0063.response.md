Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Loop Condition
The condition for the loop is:
```python
while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
```

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `count` is less than 41
- `n` is `original_n - 1` (where `original_n` is the original value of `n`)
- `x` must have its (`n`-th bit) set to 1

### Analyzing the Loop Condition
1. **First Part of the Condition: `n > 0`**
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **Second Part of the Condition: `x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1`**
   - This checks if the `n`-th bit of `x` is set to 1.
   - Since `x` must have its (`n`-th bit) set to 1, this part of the condition is already satisfied for the current value of `n`.

### Adjusting the States
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

- The current value of `n` is `original_n - 1`.
- To satisfy `n > 0`, `original_n - 1` must be greater than 0.

This means `original_n` must be greater than 1.

### Final Answer
The state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0, which means `original_n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`count` is less than 41, `n` is `original_n - 1` (where `original_n` is the original value of `n` and `original_n` must be greater than 1), and `x` must have its (`n`-th bit) set to 1.**
