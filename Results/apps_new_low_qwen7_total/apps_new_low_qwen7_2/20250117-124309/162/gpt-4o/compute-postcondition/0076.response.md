The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6. The function processes `x` through a series of conditions and operations, involving a `count` that remains less than 41, a list `operations`, a call to `func_1(x)` which returns False, and finally returns a tuple containing the modified `x` and the `count`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x` within the range of 1 to 10^6, perform certain operations based on conditions, ensure the count remains less than 41, call `func_1(x)` and return False, and return a tuple containing the modified `x` and the count.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, performs operations based on conditions, ensures `count` is less than 41, calls `func_1(x)` and returns False, and returns a tuple containing the modified `x` and `count`.**
