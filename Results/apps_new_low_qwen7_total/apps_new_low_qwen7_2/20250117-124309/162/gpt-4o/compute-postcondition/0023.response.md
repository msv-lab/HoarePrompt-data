The value of `x` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `x` is \(x + 1\). The other conditions (`func_1(x)` returns `False`, and `count % 2` is not equal to 0) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`, and `count % 2` is not equal to 0**
