The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`count` is less than 41, `n` is 0, and `x` remains the same as the initial value of `x`.**
