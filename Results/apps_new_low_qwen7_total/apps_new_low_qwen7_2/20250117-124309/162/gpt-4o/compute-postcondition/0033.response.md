`n` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `x` is at least 3 and within the range of \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\). The value of `x` itself does not change. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is at least 3 and an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\); `n` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`x` is at least 3 and an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\); `n` is incremented by 1**
