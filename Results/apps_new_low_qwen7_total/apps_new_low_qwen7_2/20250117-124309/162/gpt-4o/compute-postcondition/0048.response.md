Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer, `count` is less than 40, and `func_1(x)` returns `False`. If `count % 2 == 0`, then `x` is the result of performing the XOR operation with `(1 << n) - 1` for each `n` in `operations`, and `n` is the last value appended to `operations`. If `count % 2 != 0`, then `x` is its original value plus 1, and `n` is 0.***
