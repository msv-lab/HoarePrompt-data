Let's break down the conditions for the loop to execute the first time:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as `not func_1(x)` is `True` (i.e., `func_1(x)` returns `False`) and `count < 40`.
   - This means both conditions need to be satisfied for the loop to enter the first iteration.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).
   - `operations` is an empty list (this does not affect the loop condition).
   - `count` is 0.

3. **Loop Condition Evaluation**:
   - For the loop to enter the first iteration, `not func_1(x)` must be `True`, meaning `func_1(x)` must return `False`.
   - Additionally, `count < 40` is always `True` since `count` is initially 0 and the loop allows up to 40 iterations.

Given the above analysis, the only condition that needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute the first time is that `func_1(x)` should return `False`.

**Conclusion**:
The state right before the loop must ensure that `func_1(x)` returns `False`. Since `x` is within the specified range, we do not need to change `x` itself but ensure the function evaluation condition is met.

State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` must return `False`**
