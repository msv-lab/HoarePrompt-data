The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `n`. The initial value of `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`. The value of `count` is even. After executing the line `n = 0`, the value of `n` is updated to `0`, but the values of `x` and `count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`; `count` is even; `n` is 0**
