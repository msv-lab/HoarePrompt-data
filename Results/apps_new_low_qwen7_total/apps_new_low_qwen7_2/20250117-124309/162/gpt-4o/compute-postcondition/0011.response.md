To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while n > 0 and x >> (n - 1) & 1 == 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown:**
   - The loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
     - `n > 0`
     - `x >> (n - 1) & 1 == 1`

2. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`.
   - `count` is even.
   - `n` is the smallest integer such that \(2^n - 1 > x\).

3. **First Condition: `n > 0`:**
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be greater than 0. Given that `n` is defined as the smallest integer such that \(2^n - 1 > x\), we know that \(2^0 - 1 = 0 \leq x\). Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.

4. **Second Condition: `x >> (n - 1) & 1 == 1`:**
   - This condition checks if the bit at position `(n - 1)` in the binary representation of `x` is set (i.e., equals 1).
   - `x >> (n - 1)` shifts the bits of `x` to the right by `(n - 1)` positions.
   - `& 1` then checks the least significant bit of the result, which is the bit at position `(n - 1)` in the original `x`.

### Ensuring the Loop Executes the First Time:

For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions must be satisfied:

- **`n > 0`:**
  - Since `n` is the smallest integer such that \(2^n - 1 > x\), `n` must be at least 1. Therefore, `n` must be 1 for the loop to start.

- **`x >> (n - 1) & 1 == 1`:**
  - When `n = 1`, we need to check if the least significant bit of `x` is 1. This means `x & 1 == 1`, indicating that `x` is odd.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold:

- `n` must be 1.
- `x` must be an odd number.

### Final State Before the Loop:

State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\), `x` is odd, and `func_1(x)` returns `False`; `count` is even; `n` is 1**
