Let's analyze the given program state and the loop condition step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).
   - If `count % 2 == 0`, then `x` is -1 and `n` is 0; otherwise, `x` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`.
   - `count` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `not func_1(x)` and `count < 40`.

To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that both conditions in the loop are satisfied:
- `not func_1(x)` must be true.
- `count < 40` must be true.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `not func_1(x)`**:
   - This condition must be true for the loop to continue.
   - From the given states, if `count % 2 == 0`, then `x` is -1, but `func_1(-1)` would return some value (let's assume it does not violate the condition).
   - If `count % 2 != 0`, then `x` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`.
   - Therefore, for `not func_1(x)` to be true, either `x` is -1 or `func_1(x)` returns `False` (which is already the case for `x` being a positive integer).

2. **Condition `count < 40`**:
   - `count` starts from some initial value (let's assume it was increased by 1 during the previous iteration), and it must be less than 40 for the loop to continue.
   - Let's denote the new value of `count` as `new_count`. For the loop to execute one more time, `new_count` must be less than 40.

### Adjusting the States:

- Since `x`'s value does not affect the loop condition directly (as long as it satisfies the initial conditions), no changes are needed for `x`.
- We need to ensure `count` is less than 40 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are related to `count`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\); if `count % 2 == 0`, then `x` is -1 and `n` is 0, otherwise `x` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`; `count` must be less than 40**
