`n` is decremented by 1. The initial state tells us that `n` is `original_n - 1` and `original_n` is greater than 1. Since `n` is decremented, `n` will now be `original_n - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is less than 41; `n` is `original_n - 2`; `x` must have its (`n`-th bit) set to 1.

Output State: **`count` is less than 41; `n` is `original_n - 2`; `x` must have its (`n`-th bit) set to 1.**
