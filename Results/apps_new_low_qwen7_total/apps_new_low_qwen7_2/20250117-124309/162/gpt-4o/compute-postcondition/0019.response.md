The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but rather breaks out of the nearest loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the only thing affected is that the execution will exit the current block of code. However, since no block is specified beyond the single line of code provided, we assume this is at the top level.

Given the initial state and the fact that no block or loop is specified, the `break` statement here would simply terminate the execution of the current line of code. All the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `func_1(x)` returns `False`, `count` is even, `n` is 0.**
