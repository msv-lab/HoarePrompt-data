Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is \((1 << n) - 1 \leq x\).
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` must be at least 1 and an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).
   - If `count % 2 == 0`, then `x` is -1 and `n` is 0.
   - Otherwise, `x` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`.
   - `count` must be less than 40.
   - `n` is 1.

3. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The loop head depends on `x` and `n`.

4. **Evaluate the loop condition with the current state**:
   - Since `n` is currently 1, the loop condition becomes \((1 << 1) - 1 \leq x\), which simplifies to \(1 \leq x\).
   - Given the current state, `x` must be at least 1, and it can be any value within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).

5. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must still satisfy the condition \((1 << n) - 1 \leq x\).
   - Since `n` is 1, `x` must still be at least 1.
   - However, to ensure the loop continues, `x` should be at least \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and meet the conditions specified in the problem.

Given the conditions, we need to ensure that `x` remains valid and `n` remains 1 for the loop to continue.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` must be at least 1 and an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\), `count` must be less than 40, and `n` is 1**.
