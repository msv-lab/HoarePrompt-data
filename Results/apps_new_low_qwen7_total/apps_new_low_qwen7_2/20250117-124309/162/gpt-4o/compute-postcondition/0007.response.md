`n` is incremented by 1. Initially, `n` must be 2, so after incrementing, `n` will be 3. The values of `x`, `count`, and `func_1(x)` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`; `count` is even; `n` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`; `count` is even; `n` is 3**
