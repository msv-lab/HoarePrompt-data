The code snippet `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Given that the initial value of `n` is 3, after executing `n += 1`, the value of `n` becomes 4. 

All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state: `x` must be at least 7, `func_1(x)` returns `False`, and `count` is even.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 7, `func_1(x)` returns `False`, `count` is even, `n` is 4**
