The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Given the initial condition that `count` is less than 41, the new value of `count` will be `count + 1`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `count`, we only know that after incrementing, `count` is still less than 42 (because `count + 1` should still satisfy the condition).

Since the exact value of `count` was not specified, we can denote the new value of `count` as `count_new` where `count_new = count + 1` and `count_new < 42`.

The other variables `x` and `n` are not directly affected by this line of code unless they are explicitly referenced and modified within the scope they are defined in.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`count` is `count + 1` and `count` is less than 42**
