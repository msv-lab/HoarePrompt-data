`count` is incremented by 1. Since the initial condition states that if `count % 2 == 0`, then `x` is -1 and `n` is 0, and otherwise, `x` is a positive integer within the specified range and `func_1(x)` returns `False`, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\); if `count % 2 == 0`, then `x` is -1 and `n` is 0, otherwise `x` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`; `count` is increased by 1**
