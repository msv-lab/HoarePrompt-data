The code `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Given the initial state, `n` was 0, so after this operation, `n` becomes 1. The values of `x`, `count`, and `func_1(x)` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\), if `count % 2 == 0`, then `x` is -1 and `n` is 0, otherwise `x` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`, count must be less than 40, `n` is 1**
