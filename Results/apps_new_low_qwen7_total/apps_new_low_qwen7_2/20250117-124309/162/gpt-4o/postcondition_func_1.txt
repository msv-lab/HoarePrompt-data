The function `func_2` accepts an integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\). It iteratively modifies `x` based on certain conditions until either `func_1(x)` returns `True` (which stops the iteration) or `count` reaches 40. During each iteration, if `count` is even, it performs a series of operations involving bitwise manipulations to modify `x` and records these operations in the `operations` list. If `count` is odd, it simply increments `x` by 1. After the loop, the function returns a tuple containing the final value of `x` and the count of iterations performed. If `func_1(x)` returns `False`, the final value of `x` is returned as part of the tuple along with the count. If `func_1(x)` returns `True`, the function still returns a tuple with the final `x` and count. If `count` reaches 40 without `func_1(x)` returning `True`, the function also returns a tuple with the final `x` and count.
