    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over a sequence of operations, updating the `current_x` and `current_y` based on the operation ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). It checks if the new position exists in `position_map`. If it does, it updates `min_length`. It also updates `position_map` with the current position and the iteration index.
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
    #   - `dx` and `dy` are invariant throughout the loop.
    #   - `current_x` and `current_y` change with each iteration based on the operation.
    #   - `i` (or `n-1`) is the final index of the operations list, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
    #   - `position_map` keeps track of the indices of each visited position.
    #   - `min_length` is updated whenever a previously visited position is revisited.
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop will continue to iterate as long as there are operations left to process (`n > 0`). Each operation moves the `current_x` and `current_y` accordingly. After all iterations, `current_x` and `current_y` can be any integer within the range from `0 - n` to `0 + n` because each operation can move the coordinates by Â±1 in any direction. `position_map` will contain the indices of all unique positions visited, with the latest visit time recorded.
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: The relationships and invariants identified are consistent with the described iterations and final output state. `min_length` will be the minimum distance between any two revisited positions, or infinity if no positions were revisited.
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1
    #The program returns min_length if it is not infinity, otherwise it returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `operations` (a string consisting of exactly n characters, each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'), `x` (an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and `y` (an integer such that -10^9 <= y <= 10^9). The function calculates the net displacement of a point `(x, y)` based on a series of movements specified in the `operations` string. After processing the operations, the function determines the minimum distance to a previously visited position relative to the starting point `(x, y)`.
