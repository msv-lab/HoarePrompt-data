The code `final_y -= 1` decrements the value of `final_y` by 1. Since the initial state indicates that `final_y` has its respective value based on the operation `op`, and `operations` is a list with at least one element remaining, and `op` is the next operation in the list, the only change here is to `final_y`. Therefore, the new value of `final_y` will be its original value minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` have their respective values based on the operation `op`, `operations` is a list with at least one element remaining, and `op` is the next operation in the list; `final_y` is reduced by 1.**
