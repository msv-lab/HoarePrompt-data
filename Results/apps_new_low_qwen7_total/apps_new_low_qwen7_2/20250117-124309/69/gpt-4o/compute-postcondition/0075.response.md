Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `current_x` can be 0, -2, or -1
- `current_y` can be 0, 1, or 2
- `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`)
- `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 1
- If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is 1, otherwise the conditions remain unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 2.

### Adjusting the States:
- `i` needs to be set to 2.
- `n` remains unchanged since it is an upper limit for the loop.
- `current_x`, `current_y`, `target_pos`, and `position_map` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.
- `min_length` remains unchanged unless `target_pos` is found in `position_map` during the loop body, but this condition does not affect the initial adjustment of the loop counter.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` can be 0, -2, or -1, `current_y` can be 0, 1, or 2, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 1, if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is 1, otherwise the conditions remain unchanged**
