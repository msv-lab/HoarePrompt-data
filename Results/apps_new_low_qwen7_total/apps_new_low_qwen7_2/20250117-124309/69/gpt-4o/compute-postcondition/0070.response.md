Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. `current_x` can be 0, -2, or -1 depending on the value of `operations[0]` and `operations[i]`. `current_y` can be 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of `operations[0]` and `operations[i]`. `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`). If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is `-position_map[target_pos]`. `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 0.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, covering all possible outcomes of the `if` and `else` branches based on the values of `operations[0]` and `operations[i]`.
