`current_y` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `current_y` was either 1 or 0 (if `operations[0]` is 'U'), so it will now be 2. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` is -1 if `operations[0]` is 'L', otherwise it is 1; `current_y` is 2 if `operations[0]` is 'U', otherwise it is 1; `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`); if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is `-position_map[target_pos]`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 0.**
