Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `operations` (a string consisting of exactly n characters, each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'), `x` (an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and `y` (an integer such that -10^9 <= y <= 10^9). The function calculates the net displacement of a point `(x, y)` based on a series of movements specified in the `operations` string. After processing the operations, the function determines the minimum distance to a previously visited position relative to the starting point `(x, y)`.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
1. It initializes `final_x` and `final_y` to zero, which represent the net displacement along the x and y axes, respectively, after executing the `operations`.
2. It iterates through the `operations` string, updating `final_x` and `final_y` based on the direction specified in each character ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R').
3. It then calculates `dx` and `dy` as the differences between the initial coordinates `(x, y)` and the net displacement `(final_x, final_y)`.
4. If `dx` and `dy` are both zero, it returns 0, indicating that the starting point itself is the closest revisited position.
5. Otherwise, it resets `final_x` and `final_y` to zero and reprocesses the `operations` string, tracking the positions visited and recording the indices in a `position_map`.
6. During this second pass, it checks if the current position plus `(dx, dy)` has been visited before. If so, it updates `min_length` to the minimum distance between the current position and the previously visited position.
7. Finally, it returns `min_length` if it is not infinity, indicating the minimum distance to a previously visited position. If no such distance was found, it returns -1.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1 and the operation is 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', the function will only update `final_x` or `final_y` by one unit, and `dx` and `dy` will not be zero, leading to a non-zero `min_length` calculation.
- If the operations result in the exact same position being visited multiple times, the function will correctly identify the minimum distance between these positions.
- If no revisits occur, `min_length` will remain infinity, and the function will return -1.

This summary captures the core functionality and potential edge cases of the function, aligning with the actual code execution and the provided annotations.
