To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to start.

### Given Information:
- `dx` is `x - final_x`
- `dy` is `y - final_y`
- `current_x` is 0
- `current_y` is 0
- `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1}`
- `min_length` is `infinity`

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variables that affect the loop's execution are `i` and `n`.
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` determines the number of iterations.

2. **Initial Conditions for the Loop:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0 (the initial value) for the loop to execute the first time.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `dx`, `dy`, `current_x`, `current_y`, `position_map`, and `min_length` are not directly controlling the loop's execution.
   - They might be used inside the loop body, but their values before the loop start do not directly impact whether the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`dx`, `dy`, `current_x`, `current_y`, `position_map`, `min_length`) do not need to be explicitly adjusted since they do not control the loop's execution.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
