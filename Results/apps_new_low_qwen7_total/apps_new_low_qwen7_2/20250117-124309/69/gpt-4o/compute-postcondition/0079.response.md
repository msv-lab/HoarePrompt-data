`current_x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_x` is 0, -2, or -1, so after incrementing by 1, the new value of `current_x` will be 1, -1, or 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` is 1, -1, or 0, `current_y` can be 0, 1, or 2, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 1, if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is 1, otherwise the conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` is 1, -1, or 0, `current_y` can be 0, 1, or 2, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 1, if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is 1, otherwise the conditions remain unchanged.**
