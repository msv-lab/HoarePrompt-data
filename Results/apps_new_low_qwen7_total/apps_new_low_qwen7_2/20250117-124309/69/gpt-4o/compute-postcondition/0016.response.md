Postcondition: ***`final_x` and `final_y` are integers. If `op` is 'U', then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is 1. Otherwise, `final_x` is either -1 or 1, depending on whether `op` is 'L' or 'D', and `final_y` is 0. The list `operations` must contain at least one element, and `op` is either 'L', 'D', or 'R'.***
