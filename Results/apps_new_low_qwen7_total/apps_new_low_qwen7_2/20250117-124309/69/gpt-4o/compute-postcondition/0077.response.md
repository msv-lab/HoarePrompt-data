The code `current_y -= 1` decrements the value of `current_y` by 1. Given the initial state where `current_y` can be 0, 1, or 2, after decrementing by 1, the possible values for `current_y` are now -1, 0, or 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` can be 0, -2, or -1, `current_y` can be 0, -1, or 1, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 1, if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is 1, otherwise the conditions remain unchanged**
