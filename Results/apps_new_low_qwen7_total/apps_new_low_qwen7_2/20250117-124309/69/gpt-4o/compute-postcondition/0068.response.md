Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` is either 0 or -2 depending on the operation `operations[0]` is, `current_y` is 1 if `operations[0]` is 'U', otherwise it is 0 or 1; `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`); if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is `-position_map[target_pos]`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 0. If `operations[i] == 'L'`, `current_x` is updated to 0; otherwise, if `operations[i] == 'R'`, `current_x` is updated to -2. The state of `current_y`, `target_pos`, `min_length`, and `position_map` remains as per the if or else case.***
