`final_y` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 0. The value of `final_x` remains unchanged at 0, and the precondition that `operations` must contain at least one element is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is 0; `final_y` is 1; `operations` must contain at least one element.

Output State: **`final_x` is 0; `final_y` is 1; `operations` must contain at least one element.**
