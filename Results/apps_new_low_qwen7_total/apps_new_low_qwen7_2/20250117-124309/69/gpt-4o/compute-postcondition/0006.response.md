`final_y` is decremented by 1. The value of `final_x` remains 0, and the precondition that `operations` must contain at least one element and the operation `op` is 'D' remains unchanged.

Output State: **`final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, `operations` must contain at least one element, and the operation `op` is 'D'**
