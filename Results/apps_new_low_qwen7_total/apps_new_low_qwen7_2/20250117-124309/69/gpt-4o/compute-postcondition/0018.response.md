`final_y` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `op` is 'U', then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is 1, otherwise `final_x` is either -1 or 1 (depending on whether `op` is 'L' or 'D'), and `final_y` is 0. The list `operations` is reduced by one element and `op` is the next operation in the list.

Since `final_y` was initially 1 (if `op` is 'U') or 0 (otherwise), incrementing it by 1 means:

- If `op` is 'U', `final_y` becomes 2.
- Otherwise, `final_x` remains either -1 or 1, and `final_y` becomes 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`final_x` is either -1 or 1, `final_y` is either 1 or 2, the list `operations` is reduced by one element and `op` is the next operation in the list.**
