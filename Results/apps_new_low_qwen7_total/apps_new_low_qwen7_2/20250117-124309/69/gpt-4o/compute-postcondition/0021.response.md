The code `final_x += 1` increments the value of `final_x` by 1. Based on the initial state, if `op` is 'U', then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is 1. Otherwise, `final_x` is either -1 or 1 (depending on whether `op` is 'L' or 'D'), and `final_y` is 0. The list `operations` must contain at least one element, and `op` is either 'L', 'D', or 'R', and the list `operations` is reduced by one element, with `op` being the next operation in the list.

Since `final_x` is being incremented by 1, the new value of `final_x` will depend on its initial value:

- If `op` is 'U', `final_x` starts as 0, so it becomes 1.
- If `op` is 'L' or 'D', `final_x` starts as -1 or 1, respectively, so it becomes 0 or 2, respectively.

The values of `final_y`, `op`, and the list `operations` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- If `op` is 'U', then `final_x` is 1, `final_y` is 1.
- If `op` is 'L' or 'D', then `final_x` is 0 or 2, respectively, and `final_y` is 0.

Output State: **`final_x` is 1 if `op` is 'U', otherwise `final_x` is 0 or 2; `final_y` is 1 if `op` is 'U', otherwise `final_y` is 0; the list `operations` is reduced by one element and `op` is the next operation in the list.**
