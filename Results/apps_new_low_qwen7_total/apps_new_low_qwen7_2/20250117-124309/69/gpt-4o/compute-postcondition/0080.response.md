Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` is 1, -1, or 0, `current_y` can be 0, 1, or 2, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 1, if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is 1, otherwise the conditions remain unchanged.*** 

Since the else part is not provided and we are only considering the if part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition within the context of the if condition being true.
