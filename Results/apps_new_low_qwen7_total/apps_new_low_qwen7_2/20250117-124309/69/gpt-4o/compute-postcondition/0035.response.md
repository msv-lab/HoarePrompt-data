Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are integers determined by the sequence of operations in `operations`. After the loop has executed as many times as there are elements in `operations`, `final_x` will be the net effect of all 'L' and 'R' operations, and `final_y` will be the net effect of all 'U' and 'D' operations. The list `operations` will be empty if the loop has executed the full number of times, or non-empty if it has not.**

To summarize:
- **Invariants**: The initial state of `final_x` is 0, and `final_y` is 0. These values will be adjusted by the operations but will remain as the net sum of all 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' operations.
- **Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over each operation in `operations`, updating `final_x` and `final_y` accordingly. After the loop completes, `final_x` and `final_y` will reflect the cumulative effect of all operations in `operations`.
- **Verification**: The final state of `final_x` and `final_y` should match the described behavior after the loop has executed all its iterations, ensuring that no operations remain unexecuted and the list `operations` is empty.

Thus, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is:

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are integers representing the net displacement along the x and y axes, respectively, determined by the sequence of operations in `operations`. The list `operations` will be empty.**
