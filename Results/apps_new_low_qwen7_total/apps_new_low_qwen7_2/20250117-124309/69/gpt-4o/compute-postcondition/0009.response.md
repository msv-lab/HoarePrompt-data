`final_x` is decremented by 1. The value of `final_y` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `operations` must contain at least one element and the operation `op` is equal to 'L' is still valid.

Output State: **`final_x` is -1, `final_y` is 0, operations must contain at least one element, op is equal to 'L'**
