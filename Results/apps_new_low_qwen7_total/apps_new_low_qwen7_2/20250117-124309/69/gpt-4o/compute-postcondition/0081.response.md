Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` can be -1, -3, -2, 1, 0, `current_y` can be 0, 1, or 2, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 1, if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is 1, otherwise the conditions remain unchanged.***
