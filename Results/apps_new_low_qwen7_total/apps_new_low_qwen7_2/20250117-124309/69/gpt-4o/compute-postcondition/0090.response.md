The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `operations` (a string consisting of exactly n characters, each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'), `x` (an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and `y` (an integer such that -10^9 <= y <= 10^9). 

The function returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, the function returns `min_length` if `min_length` is not infinity; otherwise, it returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a string `operations`, and two integers `x` and `y`, and return either 0, `min_length` if it is not infinity, or -1 based on the given conditions.
