The code updates `target_pos` to the new position based on `current_x`, `current_y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The values of `current_x` and `current_y` are not directly modified by this line of code, but `target_pos` is updated to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `current_x` can be 0, -2, or -1
- `current_y` can be 0, 1, or 2
- `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`)
- If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is `-position_map[target_pos]`
- `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 0

After the line of code `target_pos = current_x + dx, current_y + dy` is executed, the value of `target_pos` is updated to the new position.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` can be 0, -2, or -1, `current_y` can be 0, 1, or 2, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is `-position_map[target_pos]`, `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 0**
