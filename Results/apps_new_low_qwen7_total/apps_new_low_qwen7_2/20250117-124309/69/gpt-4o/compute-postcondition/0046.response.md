`current_y` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` is 0 and it is specified that `n` is greater than 0. The operation `operations[i]` is 'D', but this does not affect `current_y`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `current_y` is `current_y - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `current_y` is `current_y - 1`**
