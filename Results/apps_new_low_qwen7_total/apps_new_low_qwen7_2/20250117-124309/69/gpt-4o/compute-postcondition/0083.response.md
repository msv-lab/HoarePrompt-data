Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` can be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, `current_y` can be 0, 1, 2, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 1, if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is 1, otherwise the conditions remain unchanged.***

Explanation:
- The if part specifies that if `operations[i]` is 'U', then `current_x` can be 0, -2, or -1, and `current_y` can be 1, 2, or 3. After this, `current_y` is updated to `current_y + 1`.
- The else part specifies that if `operations[i]` is not 'U', then `current_x` can be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, and `current_y` can be 0, 1, 2. After this, `current_y` is updated to `current_y - 13`.

Combining these two cases, we conclude that after the if-else block executes, `current_x` can be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, and `current_y` can be 0, 1, 2, depending on the value of `operations[i]`. The other conditions regarding `position_map` and `min_length` remain unchanged.
