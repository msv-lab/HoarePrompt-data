Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether `operations[0]` is 'L' or not, `current_y` is 1 if `operations[0]` is 'U', otherwise it is 0 or 1; `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`); if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is `-position_map[target_pos]`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 0. If `operations[i] == 'R'`, then `current_x` updates accordingly. Otherwise, the state remains as in the if part.***
