Initial State: `final_x` and `final_y` are integers representing the net displacement along the x and y axes, respectively, determined by the sequence of operations in `operations`. The list `operations` will be empty.
```

```
dx = x - final_x
dy = y - final_y
```

The first line of the code snippet, `dx = x - final_x`, subtracts the value of `final_x` from the value of `x` and assigns the result to `dx`. However, since `final_x` is not defined in the initial state, it is treated as a symbolic reference to the value that `final_x` holds, and similarly for `final_y`.

The second line of the code snippet, `dy = y - final_y`, subtracts the value of `final_y` from the value of `y` and assigns the result to `dy`.

Given that `final_x` and `final_y` represent the net displacement along the x and y axes, respectively, and considering they are not explicitly defined in the initial state other than being integers representing net displacement, the values of `x` and `y` must be interpreted as the current position relative to the starting point (0, 0) if not specified otherwise.

Since `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state and are not defined within the code block, we can infer that `x` and `y` could be considered as the coordinates of the current position. Therefore, the values of `dx` and `dy` are calculated based on the assumption that `x` and `y` are the current coordinates, and `final_x` and `final_y` are the net displacements.

However, without explicit values for `x` and `y`, the actual numerical values of `dx` and `dy` cannot be determined. But we can state the relationship:

- `dx` represents the change in the x-axis from the net displacement `final_x`.
- `dy` represents the change in the y-axis from the net displacement `final_y`.

Thus, the final state includes the updated definitions of `dx` and `dy` based on the above interpretation.

Output State: **dx is x - final_x, dy is y - final_y**
