Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` can be 0, -2, or -1, `current_y` can be 0, 1, or 2, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`). If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is 1, `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 0. If `target_pos` is not in `position_map`, the conditions remain unchanged.***
