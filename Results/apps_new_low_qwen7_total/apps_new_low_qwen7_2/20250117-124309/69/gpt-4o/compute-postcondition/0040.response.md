Output State: **dx is x - final_x, dy is y - final_y, current_x is 0, current_y is 0, position_map is {(0, 0): -1}, min_length is infinity**

Explanation:
- The initial state is given with `dx` being `x - final_x` and `dy` being `y - final_y`. Either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0.
- The first line initializes `min_length` to infinity (`float('inf')`).
- The second line sets `current_x` to 0.
- The third line sets `current_y` to 0.
- The fourth line creates a dictionary `position_map` with a single key-value pair `{(0, 0): -1}`.

No changes were made to `dx` or `dy` within the code block, so they remain as `x - final_x` and `y - final_y` respectively. All other variables are newly introduced and initialized as described.
