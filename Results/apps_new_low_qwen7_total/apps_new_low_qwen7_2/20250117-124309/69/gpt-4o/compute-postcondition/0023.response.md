Postcondition: ***`final_x` and `final_y` are integers. `op` is either 'L', 'D', 'R', or 'U'. The list `operations` is reduced by one element and `op` is the next operation in the list. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is either 0 or -2, and `final_y` is 0. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is 1 if `op` is 'U', otherwise `final_x` is 0 or 2; `final_y` is 1 if `op` is 'U', otherwise `final_y` is 0.***
