`final_x` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. The value of `final_y` remains unchanged at 0, and the precondition that `operations` must contain at least one element and the operation `op` is 'R' is still valid. 

Output State: **`final_x` is 1, `final_y` is 0, `operations` must contain at least one element, and the operation `op` is 'R'**
