The code `final_y -= 1` subtracts 1 from `final_y`. Given the initial state, if `op` is 'U', then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is 1. Otherwise, `final_x` is either -1 or 1 (depending on whether `op` is 'L' or 'D'), and `final_y` is 0. The operations list is reduced by one element, and `op` is the next operation in the list.

Since the condition `op == 'U'` initially sets `final_y` to 1, subtracting 1 from `final_y` will change its value to 0. The values of `final_x` remain unchanged because the operation does not affect `final_x`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `final_x` remains either -1 or 1 (depending on whether `op` is 'L' or 'D')
- `final_y` changes from 1 to 0

Output State: **`final_x` is either -1 or 1, `final_y` is 0**
