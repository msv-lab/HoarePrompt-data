The code snippet updates the `target_pos` by setting it to the sum of `current_x` and `dx`, and `current_y` and `dy`. The original value of `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`). Since this is a direct assignment without any additional conditions, the value of `target_pos` is now explicitly defined.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` can be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, `current_y` can be 0, 1, 2, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 1, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`)**
