Postcondition: ***`final_x` and `final_y` are integers. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is 1 if `op` is 'U', otherwise `final_x` is 0 or 2; `final_y` is 1 if `op` is 'U', otherwise `final_y` is 0; the list `operations` is reduced by one element and `op` is the next operation in the list. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the value of `op` not being 'R'.***
