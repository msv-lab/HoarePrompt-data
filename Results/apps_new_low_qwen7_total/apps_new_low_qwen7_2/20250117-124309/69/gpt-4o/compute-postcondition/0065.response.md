The code `current_x -= 1` decrements the value of `current_x` by 1. Since the initial value of `current_x` is -1 if `operations[0]` is 'L', otherwise it is 1, after decrementing by 1, the new value of `current_x` will be 0 if it was initially 1, and -2 if it was initially -1.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` is 0 if `operations[0]` is 'R', otherwise it is -2; `current_y` is 1 if `operations[0]` is 'U', otherwise it is 0 or 1; `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`); if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is `-position_map[target_pos]`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 0.**
