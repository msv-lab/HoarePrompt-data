The only object in the loop head is the variable `operations`, and this is the only one that can control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `operations`.

At the start of the loop, `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is 0. These values do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, but they might be modified within the loop body.

For the loop to execute the first time, `operations` must contain at least one element. If `operations` is empty, the loop will not execute even once.

State: **`final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0, `operations` must contain at least one element**
