`final_x` is decremented by 1. The value of `final_x` was either -1 or 1 (depending on the value of `op`), so after decrementing by 1, it becomes 0 or -2. The value of `final_y` remains unchanged, and the precondition for `op` and the list `operations` also remains valid.

Output State: **`final_x` is either 0 or -2, `final_y` is 0, `op` is either 'L', 'D', or 'R', the list `operations` is reduced by one element and `op` is the next operation in the list**
