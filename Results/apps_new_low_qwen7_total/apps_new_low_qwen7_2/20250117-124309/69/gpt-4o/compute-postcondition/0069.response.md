Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. `current_x` can be either 0 or -2, `current_y` can be 0, 1, or remains unchanged depending on the value of `operations[0]`. `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`). If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is `-position_map[target_pos]`. `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 0. If `operations[i] == 'D'`, `current_x` remains unchanged and `current_y` becomes 0. If `operations[i] == 'L'`, `current_x` is updated to 0. If `operations[i] == 'R'`, `current_x` is updated to -2. The state of `current_y`, `target_pos`, `min_length`, and `position_map` remains consistent with the if or else case.***
