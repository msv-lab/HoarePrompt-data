The code `current_x += 1` increments the value of `current_x` by 1. Since `current_x` was initially -1 if `operations[0]` is 'L', otherwise it is 1, after incrementing by 1, `current_x` will be 0 if `operations[0]` is 'L', and it will be 2 if `operations[0]` is anything else (since it would have been 1 initially). The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `current_x` is now 0 if `operations[0]` is 'L', otherwise it is 2.
- All other variables (`current_y`, `target_pos`, `min_length`, `position_map`) remain the same.

Output State: **`current_x` is 0 if `operations[0]` is 'L', otherwise it is 2; `current_y` is 1 if `operations[0]` is 'U', otherwise it is 0 or 1; `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`); if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is `-position_map[target_pos]`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 0.**
