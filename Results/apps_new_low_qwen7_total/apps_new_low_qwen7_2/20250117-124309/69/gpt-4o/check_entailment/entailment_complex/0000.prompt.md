Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` can be any integer value within the range from `0 - n` to `0 + n`, `current_y` can be any integer value within the range from `0 - n` to `0 + n`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is `n-1`, `min_length` remains its minimum value found during the loop iterations, or it remains infinity if no positions were visited more than once.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over a sequence of operations, updating the `current_x` and `current_y` based on the operation ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). It checks if the new position exists in `position_map`. If it does, it updates `min_length`. It also updates `position_map` with the current position and the iteration index.
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
    #   - `dx` and `dy` are invariant throughout the loop.
    #   - `current_x` and `current_y` change with each iteration based on the operation.
    #   - `i` (or `n-1`) is the final index of the operations list, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
    #   - `position_map` keeps track of the indices of each visited position.
    #   - `min_length` is updated whenever a previously visited position is revisited.
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop will continue to iterate as long as there are operations left to process (`n > 0`). Each operation moves the `current_x` and `current_y` accordingly. After all iterations, `current_x` and `current_y` can be any integer within the range from `0 - n` to `0 + n` because each operation can move the coordinates by ±1 in any direction. `position_map` will contain the indices of all unique positions visited, with the latest visit time recorded.
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: The relationships and invariants identified are consistent with the described iterations and final output state. `min_length` will be the minimum distance between any two revisited positions, or infinity if no positions were revisited.
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1
    #The program returns min_length if it is not infinity, otherwise it returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `operations` (a string consisting of exactly n characters, each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'), `x` (an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and `y` (an integer such that -10^9 <= y <= 10^9). The function calculates the net displacement of a point `(x, y)` based on a series of movements specified in the `operations` string. After processing the operations, the function determines the minimum distance to a previously visited position relative to the starting point `(x, y)`.
