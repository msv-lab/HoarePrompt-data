### Reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - The initial state correctly reads the input values: `n` (number of operations), `operations` (sequence of operations), and `x, y` (desired final coordinates).

2. **Function Execution**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the net displacement of the robot from the origin `(0, 0)` to the final position based on the given operations.
   - If the final position `(x, y)` matches the robot's position after executing the operations, it directly returns `0` (no changes needed).
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to find the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the desired position.

3. **Tracking Visited Positions**:
   - A dictionary `position_map` is used to store the indices of visited positions.
   - During the iteration, the function updates the current position and checks if it has been visited before. If it has, it calculates the distance from the previous visit and updates `min_length`.

4. **Final Return**:
   - The function returns the minimum length of the subsegment to be changed. If no such subsegment exists (i.e., no revisit occurs), it returns `-1`.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - The example inputs and outputs provided match the expected behavior of the function.
     - In the first example, the function correctly identifies that changing `3` operations (`RURUU` to `LULUU`) achieves the goal.
     - In the second example, the function correctly identifies that no changes are needed since the robot already reaches the target.
     - In the third example, the function correctly identifies that it is impossible to reach the target.

Given the detailed analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
