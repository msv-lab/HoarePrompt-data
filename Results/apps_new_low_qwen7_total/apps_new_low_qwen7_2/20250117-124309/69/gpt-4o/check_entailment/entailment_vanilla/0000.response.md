Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the final position of the robot after executing all operations.
   - It then checks if the final position matches the target position `(x, y)`.
   - If the final position matches, it returns `0`, indicating no changes needed.
   - If not, it uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position.

2. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - A dictionary `position_map` is used to keep track of the positions visited by the robot along with their corresponding indices.
   - As the function iterates through each operation, it updates the current position of the robot.
   - It then calculates the target position required to reach `(x, y)` from the current position.
   - The function checks if this target position has been visited before and calculates the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where the initial position does not match the target position by using a sliding window to find the minimum subsegment.
   - It correctly identifies when it is impossible to reach the target position by setting `min_length` to `float('inf')` and returning `-1`.

Given the logic in the function `func_1`, it correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. The function handles all edge cases and correctly calculates the minimum subsegment length to change the operations.

Correctness: **True**
