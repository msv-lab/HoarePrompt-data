### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function starts by calculating the net displacement of the robot after executing all operations, which gives us the `final_x` and `final_y`.
   - It then checks if the final position matches the target position `(x, y)`. If it does, it returns `0`, indicating no changes are needed.
   - If the final position does not match the target, it proceeds to use a sliding window approach to find the minimum subsegment that needs to be changed to reach `(x, y)`.

2. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - A dictionary `position_map` is used to store the positions visited by the robot along with their corresponding indices.
   - As the function iterates through each operation, it updates the current position of the robot (`current_x`, `current_y`).
   - It then calculates the target position required to reach `(x, y)` from the current position (`target_pos`).
   - The function checks if this `target_pos` has been visited before and updates `min_length` with the minimum distance between any two revisited positions.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where the initial position does not match the target position by using a sliding window to find the minimum subsegment.
   - It correctly identifies when it is impossible to reach the target position by setting `min_length` to `float('inf')` and returning `-1`.

However, there is a flaw in the implementation of the sliding window approach. Specifically, the `position_map` is used incorrectly. Instead of checking for the exact `target_pos` in `position_map`, it should check for the existence of the position `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)` directly in the sequence. This is because we need to find the minimum subsegment of operations that can change the robot's position to `(x, y)`.

Here is the detailed issue:
- The `target_pos` is calculated as `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`. This represents the position the robot would be in if the current segment of operations was modified to reach `(x, y)`.
- The function should instead check if this `target_pos` exists in the `position_map` and update `min_length` accordingly.

To correct this, the function should:
- Maintain a dictionary to store the indices of each position visited by the robot.
- During each iteration, calculate the `target_pos` and check if it exists in the `position_map`.
- Update `min_length` if a shorter subsegment is found.

The current implementation only updates `min_length` when revisiting a position but does not correctly identify the minimum subsegment that needs to be changed.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function does not correctly implement the sliding window approach to find the minimum subsegment that needs to be changed. The current implementation does not properly track the positions and indices to determine the minimum subsegment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
