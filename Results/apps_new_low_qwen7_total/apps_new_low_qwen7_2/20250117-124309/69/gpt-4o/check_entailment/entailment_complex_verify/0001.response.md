### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the final position of the robot after executing all operations.
   - It then checks if the final position matches the target position `(x, y)`.
   - If the final position matches, it returns `0`, indicating no changes needed.
   - If not, it uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position.

2. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - A dictionary `position_map` is used to keep track of the positions visited by the robot along with their corresponding indices.
   - As the function iterates through each operation, it updates the current position of the robot.
   - It then calculates the target position required to reach `(x, y)` from the current position.
   - The function checks if this target position has been visited before and calculates the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where the initial position does not match the target position by using a sliding window to find the minimum subsegment.
   - It correctly identifies when it is impossible to reach the target position by setting `min_length` to `float('inf')` and returning `-1`.

After analyzing the code and the annotated version, the logic of the function `func_1` aligns well with the problem statement. Here are the key points:

- The function correctly computes the net displacement of the robot based on the provided operations.
- It uses a sliding window approach to identify the minimum subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position.
- The function correctly handles boundary conditions, such as returning `-1` when it is impossible to reach the target position.

The initial assessment is accurate because:
- The function accurately calculates the net displacement.
- It effectively uses a dictionary to track visited positions and determine the minimum subsegment that needs to be changed.
- The logic correctly identifies impossible scenarios and returns `-1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
