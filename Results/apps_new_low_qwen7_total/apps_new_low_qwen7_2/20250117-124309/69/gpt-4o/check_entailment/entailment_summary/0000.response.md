Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly initializes variables and reads the input as specified.
2. **Displacement Calculation**: The function `func_1` accurately calculates the final position of the robot (`final_x`, `final_y`) based on the provided sequence of operations.
3. **Target Displacement**: It then computes the required displacement to reach the target position `(x, y)` from the final position of the robot.
4. **Minimum Length Calculation**: The core logic of the function iterates through the operations, tracking the current position and the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position. It uses a dictionary to keep track of positions and their indices, ensuring efficient lookups.
5. **Edge Cases Handling**: The function correctly handles cases where the robot cannot reach the target position by returning `-1`.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the logic seems to be implemented correctly. The function accurately computes the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be modified to achieve the desired target position.

Correctness: **True**
