### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness according to the problem description.

1. **Initial Assessment Recap**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the final position of the robot after executing all operations.
   - It then checks if the final position matches the target position `(x, y)`.
   - If not, it uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position.
   - The function correctly handles cases where the initial position does not match the target position and correctly identifies when it is impossible to reach the target position.

2. **Key Components of the Code**:
   - **Net Displacement Calculation**: The function correctly computes the net displacement of the robot (`final_x` and `final_y`) based on the operations.
   - **Target Position Calculation**: The target position `(dx, dy)` is correctly computed as the difference between the target position and the final position.
   - **Sliding Window Approach**: The sliding window approach is implemented using a dictionary `position_map` to keep track of visited positions and their indices.
   - **Minimum Subsegment Length Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed by checking if the target position has been visited before and calculating the difference in indices.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the initial position matches the target position, returning `0`.
   - The function correctly identifies and handles the case where it is impossible to reach the target position, returning `-1`.

4. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The function correctly updates the current position of the robot after each operation.
   - The target position is correctly calculated and checked against the `position_map` to find the minimum subsegment length.
   - The use of `float('inf')` ensures that the function correctly identifies when it is impossible to reach the target position.

Based on the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements of the problem statement. It accurately calculates the minimum subsegment length that needs to be changed to reach the target position or correctly identifies when it is impossible to do so.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately solves the problem as described.
