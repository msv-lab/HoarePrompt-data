The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `operations` (a string consisting of exactly n characters, each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'), `x` (an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and `y` (an integer such that -10^9 <= y <= 10^9). The function calculates the net displacement of a point `(x, y)` based on a series of movements specified in the `operations` string. After processing the operations, the function determines the minimum distance to a previously visited position relative to the starting point `(x, y)`.
