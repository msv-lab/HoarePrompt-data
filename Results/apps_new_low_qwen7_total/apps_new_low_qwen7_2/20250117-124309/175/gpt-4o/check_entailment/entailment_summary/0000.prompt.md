Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Implication is a function of two logical arguments, its value is false if and only if the value of the first argument is true and the value of the second argument is false. 

Implication is written by using character '$\rightarrow$', and the arguments and the result of the implication are written as '0' (false) and '1' (true). According to the definition of the implication: 

$0 \rightarrow 0 = 1$ 

$0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

$1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$ 

$1 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

When a logical expression contains multiple implications, then when there are no brackets, it will be calculated from left to fight. For example,

$0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 0 =(0 \rightarrow 0) \rightarrow 0 = 1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$. 

When there are brackets, we first calculate the expression in brackets. For example,

$0 \rightarrow(0 \rightarrow 0) = 0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$.

For the given logical expression $a_{1} \rightarrow a_{2} \rightarrow a_{3} \rightarrow \cdots \cdots a_{n}$ determine if it is possible to place there brackets so that the value of a logical expression is false. If it is possible, your task is to find such an arrangement of brackets.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of arguments in a logical expression.

The second line contains n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ($a_{i} \in \{0,1 \}$), which means the values of arguments in the expression in the order they occur.


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without the quotes), if it is impossible to place brackets in the expression so that its value was equal to 0.

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the logical expression with the required arrangement of brackets in the second line.

The expression should only contain characters '0', '1', '-' (character with ASCII code 45), '>' (character with ASCII code 62), '(' and ')'. Characters '-' and '>' can occur in an expression only paired like that: ("->") and represent implication. The total number of logical arguments (i.e. digits '0' and '1') in the expression must be equal to n. The order in which the digits follow in the expression from left to right must coincide with a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.

The expression should be correct. More formally, a correct expression is determined as follows:  Expressions "0", "1" (without the quotes) are correct.  If v_1, v_2 are correct, then v_1->v_2 is a correct expression.  If v is a correct expression, then (v) is a correct expression. 

The total number of characters in the resulting expression mustn't exceed 10^6.

If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.

1 1

Output
NO

0

Output
YES

# Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if 0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0:
        print('YES')
        result = []
        first_one_index = a.index(1)
        first_zero_index = a[first_one_index:].index(0) + first_one_index
        for i in range(first_one_index):
            result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
        result.append('(')
        for i in range(first_one_index, first_zero_index):
            result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
        result.append(str(a[first_zero_index]))
        result.append(')')
        for i in range(first_zero_index + 1, n):
            result.append('->' + str(a[i]))
        print(''.join(result))
    else:
        print('NO')





# Execution Summary:
The function processes a list `a` of `n` integers (where each integer is either 0 or 1 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000). It checks if there is at least one 1 before the first 0 in the list. If such a condition is met, it constructs a string with specific formatting and prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Specifically, the function performs the following steps:
1. Reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers.
2. Checks if there is at least one 1 before the first 0 in the list.
3. If the condition is met, it constructs a string `result` with the format: `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'`, `str(a[first_one_index + 1]) + '->'`, ..., `str(a[first_zero_index - 1]) + '->'`, `str('(') + str(a[first_zero_index]) + ')`, and `->str(a[i])` for each `i` in the range `first_zero_index + 1` to `n-1`.
4. Prints the constructed string.
5. If the condition is not met, it simply prints 'NO'.

Potential edge cases include:
- The list `a` consists entirely of 1s.
- The list `a` consists entirely of 0s.
- The list `a` contains no 1s.
- The list `a` contains only one element which is 0.
- The list `a` starts with 0 and does not contain any 1s after it.
