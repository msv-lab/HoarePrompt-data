### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: 
   - We need to check if it's possible to add parentheses to the given sequence of implications (`0` and `1`) so that the final result is `0`.
   - A key point is that an implication chain will evaluate to `0` only if the first `1` is immediately followed by a `0` without any intervening `1`s before the `0`.

2. **Key Cases**:
   - If there is no `0` in the sequence, or if the first `0` does not have all preceding elements as `1`, then it is impossible to make the expression evaluate to `0`.
   - Otherwise, the solution involves creating groups of implications where each group ends with a `1` followed by a `0`.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - First, identify the index of the first `0` in the list.
   - Check if there are any `1`s before this `0`. If there are, itâ€™s impossible to form the desired expression.
   - Construct the expression by ensuring that every segment between `1`s and `0`s is enclosed in parentheses, and the entire expression maintains the correct syntax.

4. **Code Review**:
   - The provided code correctly identifies the first `0` and checks if there are any preceding `1`s.
   - It constructs the required expression by adding parentheses around segments from the first `1` to the first `0` and continues similarly for subsequent segments.
   - The code ensures that the constructed expression is syntactically correct.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis and the structure of the provided code, the program appears to be correctly addressing the problem statement. It checks for invalid cases and constructs a valid expression if possible.

Therefore, the provided code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
