### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The task is to determine if it is possible to place brackets in the given logical expression so that the value of the expression evaluates to `0`.
   - An implication chain will evaluate to `0` if and only if the first `1` is immediately followed by a `0` without any intervening `1`s before the `0`.

2. **Key Cases**:
   - If there is no `0` in the sequence, or if the first `0` does not have all preceding elements as `1`, then it is impossible to form the desired expression.
   - Otherwise, the solution involves creating groups of implications where each group ends with a `1` followed by a `0`.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - Identify the index of the first `0` in the list.
   - Check if there are any `1`s before this `0`. If there are, it is impossible to form the desired expression.
   - Construct the expression by ensuring that every segment between `1`s and `0`s is enclosed in parentheses, and the entire expression maintains the correct syntax.

4. **Code Review**:
   - The provided code correctly identifies the first `0` and checks if there are any preceding `1`s.
   - It constructs the required expression by adding parentheses around segments from the first `1` to the first `0` and continues similarly for subsequent segments.
   - The code ensures that the constructed expression is syntactically correct.

5. **Edge Cases Consideration**:
   - The code handles several edge cases appropriately:
     - If the list consists entirely of `1`s, it correctly prints `NO`.
     - If the list consists entirely of `0`s, it correctly prints `NO`.
     - If the list contains no `1`s, it correctly prints `NO`.
     - If the list contains only one `0`, it correctly prints `NO`.
     - If the list starts with `0` and does not contain any `1`s after it, it correctly prints `NO`.

### Analysis of Function Summary:
- The function correctly identifies the presence of `1`s before the first `0`.
- It constructs the required expression by adding parentheses around segments from the first `1` to the first `0`.
- The construction logic is sound and follows the required syntax.

### Validation:
- The code logic matches the problem description and the function summary.
- The algorithm correctly identifies invalid cases and constructs valid expressions where possible.
- The provided examples demonstrate that the code works as expected.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis and validation, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
