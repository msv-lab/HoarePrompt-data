### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The goal is to determine if it's possible to add parentheses to a sequence of implications (`0` and `1`) so that the final result evaluates to `0`.
   - According to the rules of implication:
     - `0 -> 0 = 1`
     - `0 -> 1 = 1`
     - `1 -> 0 = 0`
     - `1 -> 1 = 1`
   - To achieve `0` in the final result, there must be a segment of the form `1 -> 0` without any intervening `1`s.

2. **Key Cases**:
   - If the sequence contains no `0`, or if the first `0` does not have all preceding elements as `1`, it is impossible to form the desired expression.
   - Otherwise, the solution involves creating groups of implications where each group ends with a `1` followed by a `0`.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - Identify the index of the first `0` in the list.
   - Check if there are any `1`s before this `0`. If there are, itâ€™s impossible to form the desired expression.
   - Construct the expression by enclosing segments between the first `1` and the first `0` in parentheses, and continue similarly for subsequent segments.

4. **Code Review**:
   - The provided code correctly identifies the first `0` and checks if there are any preceding `1`s.
   - It constructs the required expression by adding parentheses around segments from the first `1` to the first `0` and continues similarly for subsequent segments.
   - The code ensures that the constructed expression is syntactically correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles cases where the sequence is entirely `1`s or `0`s appropriately.
   - It also handles the case where the sequence starts with `0` and has no intervening `1`s.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either `0` or `1`.
- **Checking for `0` Before `1`**: The code correctly checks if there is at least one `1` before the first `0`. If there is, it is impossible to form the desired expression.
- **Constructing the Expression**: 
  - The code constructs the expression by identifying the indices of the first `1` and the first `0`.
  - It appends the required segments in the correct format, ensuring that each segment from the first `1` to the first `0` is enclosed in parentheses.
  - Subsequent segments are appended directly without additional parentheses.

### Validation Against Examples:

- **Example 1**: `4 0 1 1 0`
  - The code correctly identifies that it is possible to construct the expression `((0->1)->(1->0))`.
- **Example 2**: `2 1 1`
  - The code correctly identifies that it is not possible to construct the expression and prints `NO`.
- **Example 3**: `1 0`
  - The code correctly identifies that it is possible to construct the expression `0` and prints `YES`.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to place parentheses in the given sequence of implications to make the expression evaluate to `0`. The code handles all specified edge cases and produces the correct output for all given examples.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
