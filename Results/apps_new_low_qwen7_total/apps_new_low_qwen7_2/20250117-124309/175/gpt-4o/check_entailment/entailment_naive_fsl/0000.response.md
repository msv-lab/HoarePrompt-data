Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not generate valid bracketed expressions for all inputs where the value of the logical expression can be made false.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input
4
1 0 1 0
```

The expected output should be:
```
YES
(1->(0->1))->0
```

However, the current implementation fails to produce this or similar valid outputs for certain sequences. For instance, the program tries to find the first occurrence of `0` and then attempts to construct the expression around it, but it does not handle more complex cases where the placement of brackets needs to be adjusted to make the expression evaluate to `0`.

To illustrate, for the input `1 0 1 0`, the program would incorrectly try to place brackets without ensuring the correct logical structure is formed. This leads to an incomplete or incorrect solution.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
