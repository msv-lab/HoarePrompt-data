Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Determine if it is possible to place brackets in the expression \(a_{1} \rightarrow a_{2} \rightarrow a_{3} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow a_{n}\) so that its value is 0.
2. If possible, print "YES" and the logical expression with the required arrangement of brackets.
3. If not possible, print "NO".

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of arguments `n` and the list of arguments `a`.
2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if there is at least one `1` before the first `0` in the list `a`.
   - If this condition is true, the program constructs a valid logical expression by placing brackets to make the expression evaluate to `0`.
   - If this condition is false, the program correctly prints "NO".

### Detailed Breakdown:
- **Condition `0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0`:**
  - This condition checks if there is at least one `1` before the first `0` in the list `a`.
  - If this condition is true, it means that there exists a sequence of implications that can be grouped to make the entire expression evaluate to `0`.

- **Constructing the Expression:**
  - The program constructs the expression by:
    - Adding the sequence of implications from the first `1` to the first `0` enclosed in parentheses.
    - Ensuring that the first `1` is correctly placed with the first `0` and other implications.
    - Appending the remaining implications after the first `0`.

- **Edge Cases Handling:**
  - If the list consists entirely of `1`s, the condition will fail because there are no `0`s, so the program correctly prints "NO".
  - If the list consists entirely of `0`s, the condition will also fail, and the program correctly prints "NO".
  - If the list starts with `0` and does not contain any `1`s after it, the condition will fail, and the program correctly prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to check if it is possible to place brackets so that the expression evaluates to `0` and constructs the expression accordingly. The edge cases are handled correctly.

**Correctness: True**
