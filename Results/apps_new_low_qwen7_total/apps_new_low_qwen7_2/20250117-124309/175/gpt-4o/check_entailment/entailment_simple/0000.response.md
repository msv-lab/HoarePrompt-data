Reasoning:
1. **Initial State and Input Validation**:
   - The initial state is correctly defined with `n` being an integer between 1 and 100,000, and `a` being a list of `n` integers (0 or 1).
   - The program correctly handles the input validation to check if there's a 0 in `a` and if there's at least one 1 before the first 0, which is a crucial condition for the expression to evaluate to false under some bracketing.

2. **Bracketing Logic**:
   - The logic for placing brackets correctly aims to ensure the expression evaluates to false. Specifically, it tries to place the first 0 in a position where it could potentially make the entire expression false by grouping certain parts of the expression.
   - The approach taken is to:
     - Find the index of the first 0 (`first_zero_index`).
     - Find the index of the first 1 before the first 0 (`first_one_index`).
     - Construct the expression such that the sub-expression leading up to the first 0 evaluates to true, ensuring the entire expression is false when the last part is evaluated.

3. **Expression Construction**:
   - The construction logic correctly appends the necessary parts:
     - It constructs the segment before the first 0 with implications.
     - It ensures the part involving the first 0 is grouped with parentheses to achieve the desired false evaluation.
     - It appends the remaining segments after the first 0 with the necessary implications.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where there is no 0 in the list or the first 0 does not have any 1s before it, printing "NO" in such cases, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to place brackets in the expression to make it evaluate to false and constructs the expression accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
