Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Implication is a function of two logical arguments, its value is false if and only if the value of the first argument is true and the value of the second argument is false. 

Implication is written by using character '$\rightarrow$', and the arguments and the result of the implication are written as '0' (false) and '1' (true). According to the definition of the implication: 

$0 \rightarrow 0 = 1$ 

$0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

$1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$ 

$1 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

When a logical expression contains multiple implications, then when there are no brackets, it will be calculated from left to fight. For example,

$0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 0 =(0 \rightarrow 0) \rightarrow 0 = 1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$. 

When there are brackets, we first calculate the expression in brackets. For example,

$0 \rightarrow(0 \rightarrow 0) = 0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$.

For the given logical expression $a_{1} \rightarrow a_{2} \rightarrow a_{3} \rightarrow \cdots \cdots a_{n}$ determine if it is possible to place there brackets so that the value of a logical expression is false. If it is possible, your task is to find such an arrangement of brackets.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of arguments in a logical expression.

The second line contains n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ($a_{i} \in \{0,1 \}$), which means the values of arguments in the expression in the order they occur.


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without the quotes), if it is impossible to place brackets in the expression so that its value was equal to 0.

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the logical expression with the required arrangement of brackets in the second line.

The expression should only contain characters '0', '1', '-' (character with ASCII code 45), '>' (character with ASCII code 62), '(' and ')'. Characters '-' and '>' can occur in an expression only paired like that: ("->") and represent implication. The total number of logical arguments (i.e. digits '0' and '1') in the expression must be equal to n. The order in which the digits follow in the expression from left to right must coincide with a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.

The expression should be correct. More formally, a correct expression is determined as follows:  Expressions "0", "1" (without the quotes) are correct.  If v_1, v_2 are correct, then v_1->v_2 is a correct expression.  If v is a correct expression, then (v) is a correct expression. 

The total number of characters in the resulting expression mustn't exceed 10^6.

If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0) :
        print('YES')

result = []

first_one_index = a.index(1)

first_zero_index = a[first_one_index:].index(0) + first_one_index
        for i in range(first_one_index):
            result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i = first_one_index, result = [str(a[0]) + '->', str(a[1]) + '->', ..., str(a[first_one_index-1]) + '->']
        result.append('(')
        for i in range(first_one_index, first_zero_index):
            result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `first_zero_index`, `first_one_index` remains the same, `first_zero_index` remains the same, `result` is a list containing the strings `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'`, `str(a[first_one_index + 1]) + '->'`, ..., `str(a[first_zero_index - 1]) + '->'`, and `str('(')`.
        #
        #Explanation:
        #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates from `first_one_index` to `first_zero_index - 1`. Each iteration appends `str(a[i]) + '->'` to `result`.
        #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
        #   - `i` starts at `first_one_index` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `first_zero_index - 1`.
        #   - `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` remain constant as they are not updated within the loop.
        #   - `result` starts with the string `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'` and continues to append new strings as the loop runs.
        #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop will execute `first_zero_index - first_one_index - 1` times. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `first_zero_index`, and `result` will contain all the required strings.
        #4. **Verify Relationships**: The final state of `result` correctly reflects the appending of strings starting from `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'` up to `str(a[first_zero_index - 1]) + '->'`, followed by `str('(')`. The variables `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` remain unchanged, ensuring the relationships are consistent.
        result.append(str(a[first_zero_index]))

result.append(')')
        for i in range(first_zero_index + 1, n):
            result.append('->' + str(a[i]))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i is `n`, `first_one_index` remains the same, `first_zero_index` remains the same, `result` is a list containing the strings `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'`, `str(a[first_one_index + 1]) + '->'`, ..., `str(a[first_zero_index - 1]) + '->'`, `str('(') + str(a[first_zero_index]) + ')'`, and for each `i` in the range `first_zero_index + 1` to `n-1`, `'->' + str(a[i])`.
        print(''.join(result))
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. If `0` is in the list `a` and there is at least one `1` before the first `0`, then `first_one_index` remains the same, `first_zero_index` remains the same, and `result` is a list containing specific strings as described in the if part. Otherwise, the conditions are as described in the else part: 0 is not in the list `a`, or the first occurrence of 0 in `a` does not have any 1s before it.
