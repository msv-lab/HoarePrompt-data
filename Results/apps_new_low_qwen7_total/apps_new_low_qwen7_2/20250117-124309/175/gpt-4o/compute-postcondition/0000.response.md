The given code reads two inputs. The first input is an integer `n` which is the length of the list `a`. The second input is a space-separated string of `n` integers (each being either 0 or 1) which gets converted into a list `a`.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\) and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, we can conclude that after executing the provided code, the value of `n` will be set to the integer input and `a` will be updated to a list of length `n` containing either 0s or 1s.

The output state will reflect these changes without any additional information since no other variables were defined or modified.

Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1**
