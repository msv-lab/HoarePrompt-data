The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it operates on a list `a` of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, and the length of the list `a` is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. The function does not return an error message but rather returns a value based on the contents of the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function operates on a list `a` of n integers (where each integer is either 0 or 1 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) and returns a value based on the contents of the list `a`.**
