Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, there exists at least one 0 in a and all the integers in the sublist a[:a.index(0)] are greater than 0, result is an empty list, first_one_index is the index of the first 1 in a, first_zero_index is the index of the first 0 after the first 1 in a**

Explanation:
1. `print('YES')`: This line prints 'YES' to the console but does not change any variables.
2. `result = []`: This line initializes an empty list named `result`.
3. `first_one_index = a.index(1)`: This line finds the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a` and assigns this index to the variable `first_one_index`.
4. `first_zero_index = a[first_one_index:].index(0) + first_one_index`: This line finds the index of the first occurrence of `0` in the sublist `a[first_one_index:]` (i.e., starting from the first occurrence of `1`) and adds `first_one_index` to it to get the absolute index within the original list `a`. This value is then assigned to `first_zero_index`.

Since the initial conditions specify that `a` contains at least one `0` and all integers in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` are greater than `0`, these conditions are preserved in the final state. The variable `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them. The list `result` is now an empty list, and `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` are determined based on the contents of `a`.
