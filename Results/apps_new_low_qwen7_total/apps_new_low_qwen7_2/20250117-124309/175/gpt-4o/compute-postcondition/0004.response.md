The code `result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')` attempts to append a string to the list `result`. However, there is no definition of `a` in the provided initial state, and the value of `i` is 0. Since `first_one_index` must be greater than 0, it implies `first_one_index` has a value like 1, 2, etc., but it is not used in this snippet. The variable `i` is set to 0, so `a[0]` would be accessed, but since `a` is undefined, the operation cannot be completed.

Given the incomplete information, the best we can conclude is that `i` remains unchanged, and `first_one_index` still needs to be greater than 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `first_one_index` must be greater than 0**
