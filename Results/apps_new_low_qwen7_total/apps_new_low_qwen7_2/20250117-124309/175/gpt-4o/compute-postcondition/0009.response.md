Let's analyze the given code and the provided initial state step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State

The loop iterates over the range defined by `first_one_index`. During each iteration, it appends a string to the `result` list, where the string is composed of the current element of `a` and the string `->`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes

- **Invariant Variables**: 
  - `first_one_index` is the index of the first 1 in the list `a`.
  - `first_zero_index` is not directly used in the loop but is mentioned in the initial state. Since we are focusing on the loop, we can consider it as a constant in this context.
  
- **Variable Changes**:
  - `i` is incremented in each iteration.
  - `result` is appended to during each iteration.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior

- The loop will run until `i` reaches `first_one_index`.
- For each iteration, the loop appends `str(a[i]) + '->'` to `result`.
- Therefore, the length of `result` will be equal to `first_one_index`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships

- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `first_one_index`.
- The `result` list will contain strings formatted as `str(a[i]) + '->'` for each `i` from `0` to `first_one_index - 1`.

### Final Output State

Given that the loop runs for `first_one_index` iterations, we can summarize the final state as follows:

- `i` will be `first_one_index`.
- `result` will contain strings of the form `str(a[i]) + '->'` for each `i` from `0` to `first_one_index - 1`.

Since the loop runs exactly `first_one_index` times, the `result` list will have exactly `first_one_index` elements.

Output State: **i = first_one_index, result = [str(a[0]) + '->', str(a[1]) + '->', ..., str(a[first_one_index-1]) + '->']**
