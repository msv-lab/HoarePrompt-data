`result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')` appends a string formed by converting `a[i]` to a string and concatenating it with '->' to the `result` list. Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact string added to `result`. However, we know that `i` is equal to `first_one_index` from the initial state. Therefore, the string added to `result` is `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is:

**`i` is `first_one_index`, `first_one_index` must be less than `first_zero_index`; `result` contains the string `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'` appended to it.**
