You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0) :
        print('YES')

result = []

first_one_index = a.index(1)

first_zero_index = a[first_one_index:].index(0) + first_one_index
        for i in range(first_one_index):
            result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i = first_one_index, result = [str(a[0]) + '->', str(a[1]) + '->', ..., str(a[first_one_index-1]) + '->']
        result.append('(')
        for i in range(first_one_index, first_zero_index):
            result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `first_zero_index`, `first_one_index` remains the same, `first_zero_index` remains the same, `result` is a list containing the strings `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'`, `str(a[first_one_index + 1]) + '->'`, ..., `str(a[first_zero_index - 1]) + '->'`, and `str('(')`.
        #
        #Explanation:
        #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates from `first_one_index` to `first_zero_index - 1`. Each iteration appends `str(a[i]) + '->'` to `result`.
        #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
        #   - `i` starts at `first_one_index` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `first_zero_index - 1`.
        #   - `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` remain constant as they are not updated within the loop.
        #   - `result` starts with the string `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'` and continues to append new strings as the loop runs.
        #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop will execute `first_zero_index - first_one_index - 1` times. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `first_zero_index`, and `result` will contain all the required strings.
        #4. **Verify Relationships**: The final state of `result` correctly reflects the appending of strings starting from `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'` up to `str(a[first_zero_index - 1]) + '->'`, followed by `str('(')`. The variables `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` remain unchanged, ensuring the relationships are consistent.
        result.append(str(a[first_zero_index]))

result.append(')')
        for i in range(first_zero_index + 1, n):
            result.append('->' + str(a[i]))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i is `n`, `first_one_index` remains the same, `first_zero_index` remains the same, `result` is a list containing the strings `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'`, `str(a[first_one_index + 1]) + '->'`, ..., `str(a[first_zero_index - 1]) + '->'`, `str('(') + str(a[first_zero_index]) + ')'`, and for each `i` in the range `first_zero_index + 1` to `n-1`, `'->' + str(a[i])`.
        print(''.join(result))
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. If `0` is in the list `a` and there is at least one `1` before the first `0`, then `first_one_index` remains the same, `first_zero_index` remains the same, and `result` is a list containing specific strings as described in the if part. Otherwise, the conditions are as described in the else part: 0 is not in the list `a`, or the first occurrence of 0 in `a` does not have any 1s before it.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates on a list `a` of n integers (where each integer is either 0 or 1 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) and returns a value based on the contents of the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
