The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is the printed output, but since the task is to focus on the state of variables, the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, 0 is not in the list `a`, or the first occurrence of 0 in `a` does not have any 1s before it**
