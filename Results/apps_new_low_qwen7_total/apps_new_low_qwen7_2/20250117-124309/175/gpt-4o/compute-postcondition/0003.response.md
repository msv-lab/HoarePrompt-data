Let's break down the conditions required for the loop to execute the first time based on the given state before the loop starts.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `first_one_index`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute the first time when `i` is equal to `0`.

2. **Initial Conditions Before the Loop**:
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either `0` or `1`.
   - There exists at least one `0` in `a`.
   - All the integers in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` are greater than `0`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `first_one_index` is the index of the first `1` in `a`.
   - `first_zero_index` is the index of the first `0` after the first `1` in `a`.

3. **State Required for the First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be `0`.
   - Since `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` with each iteration, the loop will execute the first time if `i` is `0`.

4. **Ensuring Other Conditions Hold**:
   - We need to ensure that `first_one_index` is at least `1` because `i` starts from `0` and we want the loop to start from the index just after the first `1`.
   - The presence of `0` and `1` in `a` ensures that `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` are meaningful.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes the first time, `i` must be `0`, and `first_one_index` must be greater than `0`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `first_one_index` must be greater than 0**

This state ensures that the loop can execute its first iteration as required.
