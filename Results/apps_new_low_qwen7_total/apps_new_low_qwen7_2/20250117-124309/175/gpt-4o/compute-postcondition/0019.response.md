Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the `range` function.
   - The boundary conditions for the loop are defined by `first_zero_index + 1` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be set to the lower bound of the `range`, which is `first_zero_index + 1`.
   - The condition `i < n` must hold true for the loop to continue executing.

3. **Verify the Given State**:
   - The initial state given is: `i` is `first_zero_index`, `first_one_index` remains the same, `first_zero_index` remains the same, `result` is a list containing specific strings.
   - Since `i` is initially `first_zero_index`, the loop will not execute because `i` is not equal to `first_zero_index + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State to Ensure the Loop Executes**:
   - To ensure the loop executes the first time, `i` must be set to `first_zero_index + 1`.
   - The other variables (`first_one_index`, `first_zero_index`, and `result`) do not directly affect whether the loop can execute; they remain as they are.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure `i` is set to `first_zero_index + 1` for the loop to execute the first time.

**State**: **`i` is `first_zero_index + 1`, `first_one_index` remains the same, `first_zero_index` remains the same, `result` is a list containing the strings str(a[first_one_index]) + '->', str(a[first_one_index + 1]) + '->', ..., str(a[first_zero_index - 1]) + '->', str('('), str(a[first_zero_index]), ')'**
