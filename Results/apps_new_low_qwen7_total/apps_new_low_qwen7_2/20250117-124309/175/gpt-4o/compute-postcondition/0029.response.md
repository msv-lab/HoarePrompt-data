Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. If `0` is in the list `a` and there is at least one `1` before the first `0`, then `first_one_index` remains the same, `first_zero_index` remains the same, and `result` is a list containing specific strings as described in the if part. Otherwise, the conditions are as described in the else part: 0 is not in the list `a`, or the first occurrence of 0 in `a` does not have any 1s before it.**
