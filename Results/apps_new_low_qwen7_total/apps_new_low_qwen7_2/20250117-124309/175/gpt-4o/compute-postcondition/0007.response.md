Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the variable `first_one_index`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < first_one_index`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `first_one_index`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `first_one_index` must be greater than 1
   - `result` is `['test->']`

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2 (assuming it increments by 1 as per typical for loops).
   - For the loop to execute, `first_one_index` must still be greater than 1. Since we are not given a specific value, we know it must remain greater than 1.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` should be adjusted to 2.
   - `first_one_index` remains greater than 1.
   - `result` remains `['test->']` since it is not modified within the loop head.

Based on these steps, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `first_one_index` must be greater than 1, `result` is ['test->']**
