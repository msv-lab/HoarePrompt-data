Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - We know that the string `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'` was appended to the `result` list in the previous iteration.
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(first_one_index, first_zero_index):`.
   - This means that `i` starts from `first_one_index` and increments until it reaches `first_zero_index`.

2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to `first_one_index`.
   - `first_one_index` must be less than `first_zero_index`.
   - `result` contains the string `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'` appended to it.

3. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop head specifies that `i` should range from `first_one_index` to `first_zero_index`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and still within the range.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value, so `i` will become `first_one_index + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `first_one_index + 1` must still be less than `first_zero_index`.

5. **Output State:**
   - The state of `i` will change to `first_one_index + 1`.
   - `first_one_index` remains the same.
   - `first_zero_index` remains the same.
   - `result` will contain the string `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'` from the previous iteration plus the new string if the loop continues.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:

**`i` is `first_one_index + 1`, `first_one_index` must be less than `first_zero_index`; `result` contains the string `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'` appended to it.**
