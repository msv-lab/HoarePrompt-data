Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop starts from `first_zero_index + 1` and goes up to `n`. So, the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `first_zero_index + 1`.
   - `first_one_index` remains the same.
   - `first_zero_index` remains the same.
   - `result` is a list containing specific strings based on the values in the array `a`.

4. **Next iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `first_zero_index + 2`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` changes to `first_zero_index + 2`.
   - `first_one_index` remains unchanged.
   - `first_zero_index` remains unchanged.
   - `result` does not change because it is determined by the array `a` and the indices, which are not affected by the loop.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `first_zero_index + 2`, `first_one_index` remains the same, `first_zero_index` remains the same, `result` is a list containing the strings str(a[first_one_index]) + '->', str(a[first_one_index + 1]) + '->', ..., str(a[first_zero_index - 1]) + '->', str('(') + str(a[first_zero_index]) + ')', '->' + str(a[first_zero_index + 1])**
