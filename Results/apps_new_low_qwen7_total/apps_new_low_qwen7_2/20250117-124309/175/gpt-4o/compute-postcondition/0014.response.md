The code snippet `result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')` appends a string to the list `result`. This string is formed by converting the element `a[i]` to a string and appending `'->'` to it. The previous state of `i` is `first_one_index + 1`, and the values of `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` remain unchanged. The `result` list now contains an additional element compared to the previous iteration.

Given the initial conditions, let's assume the following for clarity:
- `i` is `first_one_index + 1`.
- `first_one_index` remains the same.
- `first_zero_index` remains the same.
- `result` contains the string `str(a[first_one_index]) + '->'` from the previous iteration.

After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, and the new element is appended to `result`.

Output State: **`i` is `first_one_index + 2`, `first_one_index` remains the same, `first_zero_index` remains the same, `result` is `result` from the previous iteration plus the string `str(a[first_one_index + 1]) + '->'`.**
