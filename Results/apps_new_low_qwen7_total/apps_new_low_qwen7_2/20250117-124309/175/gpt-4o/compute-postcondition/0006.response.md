The code `result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')` attempts to append a string to the list `result`. However, there are a few issues to note:

1. The variable `a` is not defined in the given initial state or within the provided code snippet.
2. The index `i` is set to 1, but no value is assigned to `a[1]`.

Given these points, let's assume that `a` is a list and `a[1]` is some value (since it must be greater than 1 for `first_one_index`), and proceed with the assumption that `a[1]` is a string or can be converted to a string.

Let's assume `a[1]` is "test" (this is just an assumption for the sake of the example).

The code would then execute as follows:
- `str(a[i])` converts `a[1]` to a string, which is "test".
- `"test" + '->'` concatenates the string "test" with "->", resulting in "test->".
- `result.append("test->")` appends this string to the list `result`.

Since `i` is 1 and no changes are made to `i`, its value remains 1. Also, `first_one_index` being greater than 1 is still a valid condition since no changes are made to it.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `first_one_index` must be greater than 1, `result` is ['test->']**
