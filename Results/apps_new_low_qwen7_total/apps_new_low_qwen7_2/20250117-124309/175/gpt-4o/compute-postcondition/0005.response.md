Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
  - `i` is 0
  - `first_one_index` must be greater than 0
- **For loop statement**:
  ```python
  for i in range(first_one_index):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = first_one_index - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `first_one_index` must be greater than 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `first_one_index` must be greater than 0.

2. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1 if the loop continues.
   
3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition `i < first_one_index` must hold true for the loop to continue.
   - Since `i` is now 0 and the loop must run again, `first_one_index` must be greater than 1 (i.e., `first_one_index > 1`).

### Adjusted States
- `i` will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.
- `first_one_index` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

### Final State
- `i` is 1
- `first_one_index` must be greater than 1

### Answer
State: **`i` is 1, `first_one_index` must be greater than 1**
