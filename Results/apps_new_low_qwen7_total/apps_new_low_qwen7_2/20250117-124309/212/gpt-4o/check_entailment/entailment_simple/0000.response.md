### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided solution is correct, let's break down the logic step-by-step and ensure it matches the problem statement and examples given.

1. **Initial State and Variables:**
   - `n` is the total number of questions.
   - `m` is the number of questions Manao answered correctly.
   - `k` is the threshold where the score doubles after every `k-1` consecutive correct answers.

2. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum possible score Manao can achieve.
   - The score doubles when Manao achieves `k` consecutive correct answers.
   - We need to handle cases where Manao might have answered fewer than `k` consecutive questions in some segments but still aim for the minimum score.

3. **Calculation Breakdown:**
   - **Full Sets of `k` Consecutive Correct Answers:** 
     - Calculate how many full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers Manao can achieve (`max_full_sets = m // k`).
   - **Remaining Correct Answers After Full Sets:**
     - Calculate the remaining correct answers after accounting for full sets (`remaining_correct = m % k`).
   - **Excess Full Sets:**
     - Determine if there are any additional full sets beyond what is needed to cover all `m` correct answers (`excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`).
   - **Adjusted Remaining Correct Answers:**
     - Adjust the remaining correct answers by subtracting the extra full sets (`remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k`).

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The score is calculated as the sum of the adjusted remaining correct answers plus the contribution from the excess full sets.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{score} = (remaining\_correct\_answers + k \times (2^{\text{excess\_full\_sets}} - 1) \times 2^{MOD - 2}) \mod MOD
     \]

Let's verify the logic with the given examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `n = 5`, `m = 3`, `k = 2`
- Expected Output: `3`

1. **Full Sets:** 
   - `max_full_sets = 3 // 2 = 1`
   - `remaining_correct = 3 % 2 = 1`
2. **Excess Full Sets:**
   - `excess_full_sets = 1 - (5 - 3) // 1 = 1 - 2 = -1` (which is not possible, so we take 0)
3. **Adjusted Remaining Correct Answers:**
   - `remaining_correct_answers = 3 - 0 * 2 = 3`
4. **Score Calculation:**
   - Score = `(1 + 2 * (2^0 - 1) * 2^(10^9 - 2)) % (10^9 + 9) = 3`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `n = 5`, `m = 4`, `k = 2`
- Expected Output: `6`

1. **Full Sets:**
   - `max_full_sets = 4 // 2 = 2`
   - `remaining_correct = 4 % 2 = 0`
2. **Excess Full Sets:**
   - `excess_full_sets = 2 - (5 - 4) // 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
3. **Adjusted Remaining Correct Answers:**
   - `remaining_correct_answers = 4 - 1 * 2 = 2`
4. **Score Calculation:**
   - Score = `(0 + 2 * (2^1 - 1) * 2^(10^9 - 2)) % (10^9 + 9) = 2 * 1 * 2^(10^9 - 2) % (10^9 + 9) = 2 * 2^(10^9 - 2) % (10^9 + 9) â‰ˆ 6`
