### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- Manao answers \( m \) questions correctly out of \( n \) questions.
- Each correct answer increases the score by 1.
- After every \( k \) consecutive correct answers, the score doubles, but the counter of consecutive correct answers resets to 0.
- We need to find the minimum possible score Manao can achieve, and print the remainder of this score modulo \( 1000000009 \).

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the score based on the number of full sets of \( k \) consecutive correct answers.
- It handles the case where the number of correct answers \( m \) exceeds the total number of questions \( n \) by ensuring the score does not exceed \( n \).

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Variables Initialization:**
   ```python
   (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
   print(func_1(n, m, k))
   ```

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, m, k):
       max_full_sets = m // k
       remaining_correct = m % k
       if m <= n:
           score = m
       else:
           excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
           remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
           score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
       return score % MOD
   ```

#### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly checks if \( m \leq n \). If true, it directly returns \( m \), which is the minimum score possible.
   - If \( m > n \), the function calculates the number of full sets of \( k \) consecutive correct answers that can fit into \( n \) questions and then computes the remaining correct answers.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The score is calculated by considering the remaining correct answers and the effect of doubling the score after each full set of \( k \) correct answers.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the score is computed correctly within the required bounds.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The function handles the case where the number of correct answers \( m \) exceeds the number of questions \( n \) by ensuring the score is capped at \( n \).

Given the detailed analysis and the function summary, the original assessment's conclusion that the program has a logic flaw is incorrect. The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the function summary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary provided.
