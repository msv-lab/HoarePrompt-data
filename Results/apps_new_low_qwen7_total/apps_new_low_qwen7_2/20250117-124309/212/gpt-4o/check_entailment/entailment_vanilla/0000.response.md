### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1` Breakdown:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `max_full_sets`: Number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers Manao can achieve.
     - `remaining_correct`: Remaining correct answers after accounting for full sets.
   - **Base Case:**
     - If the total correct answers (`m`) are less than or equal to `n - n // k`, then Manao doesn't need to double any scores due to the counter rule. Thus, the score is simply `m`.
   - **General Case:**
     - Calculate `excess_full_sets`: The number of additional full sets beyond what can fit within `n - m` questions.
     - Calculate `remaining_correct_answers`: The number of correct answers left after accounting for the excess full sets.
     - Use modular exponentiation to compute the score correctly, ensuring the result is taken modulo `1000000009`.

2. **Key Operations:**
   - **Modular Exponentiation:** 
     - `pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD)` calculates \(2^{excess\_full\_sets} \mod 1000000009\).
     - `pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)` is used for calculating the modular inverse of 2, which helps in avoiding overflow and ensuring operations are within the modulus.
   - **Score Calculation:**
     - The final score is derived by adding the remaining correct answers and applying the doubling effect for each full set of `k` consecutive correct answers.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The constraints are well-handled with the logic ensuring the score is calculated correctly under all scenarios (e.g., when `m` is small, when there are many full sets, etc.).

### Correctness Verification:

- The program correctly handles the basic cases where no full sets are formed or the full sets are formed.
- The modular arithmetic is handled properly using `pow()` for large powers and inverses.
- The overall logic ensures the score is minimized as required by the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
