### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1` Breakdown:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `max_full_sets`: Number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers Manao can achieve.
     - `remaining_correct`: Remaining correct answers after accounting for full sets.
   - **Base Case:**
     - If the total correct answers (`m`) are less than or equal to `n - n // k`, then Manao doesn't need to double any scores due to the counter rule. Thus, the score is simply `m`.
   - **General Case:**
     - Calculate `excess_full_sets`: The number of additional full sets beyond what can fit within `n - m` questions.
     - Calculate `remaining_correct_answers`: The number of correct answers left after accounting for the excess full sets.
     - Use modular exponentiation to compute the score correctly, ensuring the result is taken modulo `1000000009`.

2. **Key Operations:**
   - **Modular Exponentiation:**
     - `pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD)` calculates \(2^{excess\_full\_sets} \mod 1000000009\).
     - `pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)` is used for calculating the modular inverse of 2, which helps in avoiding overflow and ensuring operations are within the modulus.
   - **Score Calculation:**
     - The final score is derived by adding the remaining correct answers and applying the doubling effect for each full set of `k` consecutive correct answers.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The constraints are well-handled with the logic ensuring the score is calculated correctly under all scenarios (e.g., when `m` is small, when there are many full sets, etc.).

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the original assessment might have overlooked some edge cases and logical errors in the implementation.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Base Case Handling:**
   - The base case `if m <= n - n // k:` checks if the number of correct answers `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`. This condition ensures that the number of full sets (`max_full_sets`) can fit within the remaining questions without needing to double the score.
   - However, the expression `n - n // k` simplifies to `n - floor(n/k)`, which is always less than `n`. Therefore, the base case condition is always true if `m` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Excess Full Sets Calculation:**
   - The variable `excess_full_sets` is calculated as `max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`. This formula aims to determine how many additional full sets can be formed beyond the current count.
   - The term `(n - m) // (k - 1)` represents the maximum number of additional full sets that can be formed with the remaining questions, but it might not always align correctly with the actual number of full sets needed.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The final score calculation involves the formula: `(remaining_correct_answers + k * (2^(excess_full_sets) - 1) * 2^(MOD - 2) % MOD) % MOD`.
   - This formula correctly applies the doubling effect for each full set, but the way `excess_full_sets` is computed might lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:

Consider the input `n=5, m=3, k=2`:
- Base case check: `m (3) <= n - n // k (5 - 5 // 2 = 3)`, so it enters the base case.
- The score is directly set to `m % MOD = 3 % MOD = 3`, which is correct.

Consider another input `n=5, m=4, k=2`:
- Base case check: `m (4) > n - n // k (3)`, so it goes to the else block.
- `max_full_sets = 2`, `remaining_correct = 0`.
- `excess_full_sets = 2 - (5 - 4) // (2 - 1) = 2 - 1 = 1`.
- `remaining_correct_answers = 4 - 1 * 2 = 2`.
- Score calculation: `2 + 2 * (2^1 - 1) * 2^(MOD - 2) % MOD = 2 + 2 * 1 * 2^999999987 % MOD = 2 + 2 * 2^999999987 % MOD`.
- This calculation is correct but the implementation might have issues with handling large exponents.

### Conclusion:

Upon re-evaluation, the program logic seems to have some flaws in the way `excess_full_sets` is calculated and the final score is derived. The original assessment did not fully capture these issues.

Final: **False**
