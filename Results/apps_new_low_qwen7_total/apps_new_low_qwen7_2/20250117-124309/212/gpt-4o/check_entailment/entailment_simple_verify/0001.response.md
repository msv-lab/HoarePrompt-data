### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1` Breakdown:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `max_full_sets = m // k`: This calculates the maximum number of complete sets of `k` consecutive correct answers.
     - `remaining_correct = m % k`: This calculates the remaining correct answers after forming the maximum number of complete sets.
   - **Base Case:**
     - If `m <= n - n // k`, it means that the number of correct answers is relatively small compared to the remaining questions, and the score can be directly calculated as `m % MOD`. This is because there won't be enough questions left to form additional sets of `k` consecutive correct answers to trigger the doubling mechanism.
   - **General Case:**
     - Calculate `excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`: This calculates the number of additional sets of `k` consecutive correct answers that can be formed beyond the `n - m` remaining questions.
     - Calculate `remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k`: This calculates the number of correct answers left after accounting for these additional sets.
     - Use modular exponentiation to compute the score correctly: 
       - `pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD)`: Calculates \(2^{excess\_full\_sets} \mod 1000000009\).
       - `pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)`: Calculates the modular inverse of 2, which is used to avoid overflow and ensure operations are within the modulus.
     - The final score is derived by adding the remaining correct answers and applying the doubling effect for each full set of `k` consecutive correct answers.

2. **Key Operations:**
   - **Modular Exponentiation:**
     - The use of `pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD)` and `pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)` ensures that the calculations are performed correctly under modulo arithmetic.
   - **Score Calculation:**
     - The final score is derived by adding the remaining correct answers and applying the doubling effect for each full set of `k` consecutive correct answers.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The constraints are well-handled with the logic ensuring the score is calculated correctly under all scenarios (e.g., when `m` is small, when there are many full sets, etc.).

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotated Code:

```python
MOD = 1000000009
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k  # Number of complete sets of k consecutive correct answers
    remaining_correct = m % k  # Remaining correct answers after forming complete sets
    
    if m <= n - n // k:
        # Base case: No additional full sets can be formed
        score = m % MOD
    else:
        # General case: Additional full sets can be formed
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)  # Number of additional full sets
        remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k  # Remaining correct answers after accounting for additional full sets
        
        # Calculate the score
        score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD

    return score
```

- **Base Case:**
  - If `m <= n - n // k`, then the score is simply `m % MOD`.
  - Example: If `m = 3` and `n = 5`, then `n - n // k = 5 - 5 // 2 = 2.5`, so `m <= 2.5` is true, and the score is `3 % 1000000009 = 3`.

- **General Case:**
  - If `m > n - n // k`, then the score is calculated as follows:
    - `excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`: This ensures we account for the additional sets that can be formed.
    - `remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k`: This accounts for the remaining correct answers after accounting for the additional sets.
    - The score is computed as `(remaining_correct_answers + k * (2^{excess_full_sets} - 1) * 2^{MOD - 2}) % MOD`: This ensures the score is doubled for each additional set and the final result is taken modulo `1000000009`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles both the base and general cases, ensuring the score is minimized as required by the problem statement. The use of modular arithmetic and the handling of edge cases are appropriate.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**
