You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Manao is taking part in a quiz. The quiz consists of n consecutive questions. A correct answer gives one point to the player. The game also has a counter of consecutive correct answers. When the player answers a question correctly, the number on this counter increases by 1. If the player answers a question incorrectly, the counter is reset, that is, the number on it reduces to 0. If after an answer the counter reaches the number k, then it is reset, and the player's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player's score, and then the total score is doubled. At the beginning of the game, both the player's score and the counter of consecutive correct answers are set to zero.

Manao remembers that he has answered exactly m questions correctly. But he does not remember the order in which the questions came. He's trying to figure out what his minimum score may be. Help him and compute the remainder of the corresponding number after division by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).


-----Input-----

The single line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; 0 ≤ m ≤ n).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the remainder from division of Manao's minimum possible score in the quiz by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 3 2

Output
3

Input
5 4 2

Output
6



-----Note-----

Sample 1. Manao answered 3 questions out of 5, and his score would double for each two consecutive correct answers. If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points.

Sample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.

Also note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009. For example, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the answer is 2000000000 mod 1000000009, even though 2000000020 mod 1000000009 is a smaller number.

- Program: 
MOD = 1000000009
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k
    remaining_correct = m % k
    if m <= n - n // k:
        score = m % MOD
    else:
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
        remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
        score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    return score



- Annotated Code: 
MOD = 1000000009
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, m, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k

remaining_correct = m % k
    if (m <= n - n // k) :
        score = m % MOD
    else :
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)

remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k

score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1
    ) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `max_full_sets` is \( m // k \), `remaining_correct` is \( m \% k \), `excess_full_sets` is \( m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1) \), `remaining_correct_answers` is \( m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) * k \), and `score` is \( (m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) * k + k * (2^{(m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1))} - 1) * 2^{MOD - 2}) \% MOD \).
    return score
    #score which is calculated as (m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) * k + k * (2



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1` Breakdown:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `max_full_sets`: Number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers Manao can achieve.
     - `remaining_correct`: Remaining correct answers after accounting for full sets.
   - **Base Case:**
     - If the total correct answers (`m`) are less than or equal to `n - n // k`, then Manao doesn't need to double any scores due to the counter rule. Thus, the score is simply `m`.
   - **General Case:**
     - Calculate `excess_full_sets`: The number of additional full sets beyond what can fit within `n - m` questions.
     - Calculate `remaining_correct_answers`: The number of correct answers left after accounting for the excess full sets.
     - Use modular exponentiation to compute the score correctly, ensuring the result is taken modulo `1000000009`.

2. **Key Operations:**
   - **Modular Exponentiation:** 
     - `pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD)` calculates \(2^{excess\_full\_sets} \mod 1000000009\).
     - `pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)` is used for calculating the modular inverse of 2, which helps in avoiding overflow and ensuring operations are within the modulus.
   - **Score Calculation:**
     - The final score is derived by adding the remaining correct answers and applying the doubling effect for each full set of `k` consecutive correct answers.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The constraints are well-handled with the logic ensuring the score is calculated correctly under all scenarios (e.g., when `m` is small, when there are many full sets, etc.).

### Correctness Verification:

- The program correctly handles the basic cases where no full sets are formed or the full sets are formed.
- The modular arithmetic is handled properly using `pow()` for large powers and inverses.
- The overall logic ensures the score is minimized as required by the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
