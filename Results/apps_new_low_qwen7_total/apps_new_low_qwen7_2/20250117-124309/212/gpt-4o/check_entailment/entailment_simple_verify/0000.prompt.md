You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Manao is taking part in a quiz. The quiz consists of n consecutive questions. A correct answer gives one point to the player. The game also has a counter of consecutive correct answers. When the player answers a question correctly, the number on this counter increases by 1. If the player answers a question incorrectly, the counter is reset, that is, the number on it reduces to 0. If after an answer the counter reaches the number k, then it is reset, and the player's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player's score, and then the total score is doubled. At the beginning of the game, both the player's score and the counter of consecutive correct answers are set to zero.

Manao remembers that he has answered exactly m questions correctly. But he does not remember the order in which the questions came. He's trying to figure out what his minimum score may be. Help him and compute the remainder of the corresponding number after division by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).


-----Input-----

The single line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; 0 ≤ m ≤ n).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the remainder from division of Manao's minimum possible score in the quiz by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 3 2

Output
3

Input
5 4 2

Output
6



-----Note-----

Sample 1. Manao answered 3 questions out of 5, and his score would double for each two consecutive correct answers. If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points.

Sample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.

Also note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009. For example, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the answer is 2000000000 mod 1000000009, even though 2000000020 mod 1000000009 is a smaller number.

- Program: 
MOD = 1000000009
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k
    remaining_correct = m % k
    if m <= n - n // k:
        score = m % MOD
    else:
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
        remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
        score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    return score



- Annotated Code: 
MOD = 1000000009
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, m, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k

remaining_correct = m % k
    if (m <= n - n // k) :
        score = m % MOD
    else :
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)

remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k

score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1
    ) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `max_full_sets` is \( m // k \), `remaining_correct` is \( m \% k \), `excess_full_sets` is \( m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1) \), `remaining_correct_answers` is \( m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) * k \), and `score` is \( (m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) * k + k * (2^{(m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1))} - 1) * 2^{MOD - 2}) \% MOD \).
    return score
    #score which is calculated as (m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) * k + k * (2



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program seems to have a logic flaw in how it calculates the score. Specifically, the calculation of `score` in the `func_1` function does not correctly account for the scenario where the number of correct answers `m` exceeds the maximum number of correct answers possible without exceeding the number of questions `n`.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 7`, `m = 8`, `k = 2`

According to the problem description, Manao can answer up to 7 questions correctly, but here `m` is 8. The program should handle this case correctly by considering the maximum possible score without exceeding `n`.

In this specific case, the program will attempt to calculate the score as if `m` were within the limit, which leads to incorrect results. The correct approach would involve ensuring that the score does not exceed the total number of questions available.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the score is capped at `n`. Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
MOD = 1000000009
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k
    remaining_correct = m % k
    if m <= n:
        score = m
    else:
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
        remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
        score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    return score % MOD
```

This revised version ensures that the score is always capped at `n`, which aligns with the problem constraints.
