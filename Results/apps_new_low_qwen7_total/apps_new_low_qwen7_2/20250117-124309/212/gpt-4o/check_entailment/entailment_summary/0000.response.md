Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to verify that it follows the rules described in the problem statement and accurately computes the minimum possible score modulo \(10^9 + 9\).

1. **Function Inputs and Modulo Operation**: The function `func_1` takes three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and returns the score modulo \(10^9 + 9\). This aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Full Sets Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `max_full_sets` as `m // k`. This represents the maximum number of complete sets of `k` consecutive correct answers that can be formed from `m` correct answers.
   - The remaining correct answers after forming these full sets are calculated as `remaining_correct = m % k`. This is done correctly.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - If the number of full sets (`max_full_sets`) is less than or equal to \((n - m) // (k - 1)\), the score is simply the number of remaining correct answers, taken modulo \(10^9 + 9\).
   - Otherwise, the function calculates the excess full sets required to reach at least `n` correct answers. This is done by computing `excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`.

4. **Handling Remaining Correct Answers and Excess Full Sets**:
   - After calculating the excess full sets, the remaining correct answers are updated as `remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k`.
   - The final score is computed using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{score} = (\text{remaining\_correct\_answers} + k \times (2^{\text{excess\_full\_sets}} - 1) \times 2^{(\text{MOD} - 2)} \mod \text{MOD}) \mod \text{MOD}
     \]
   - The use of modular exponentiation (`pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD)`) and the modular inverse (`pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)`) is appropriate for handling large numbers and ensuring the calculations remain within the bounds of \(10^9 + 9\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `m` is zero, resulting in no full sets and a score based solely on the excess full sets calculation.
   - If `m` is exactly `n` and `k`, the function will correctly calculate the score because it will account for all the correct answers through the excess full sets calculation.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided solution appears to follow the problem specification correctly and should produce the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
