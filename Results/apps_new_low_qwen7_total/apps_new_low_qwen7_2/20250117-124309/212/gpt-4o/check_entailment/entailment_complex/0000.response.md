Reasoning:
The given solution follows the logic to compute the minimum possible score for Manao based on the constraints provided. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Determining Full Sets**: 
   - `max_full_sets = m // k` calculates the number of complete sets of `k` correct answers Manao can achieve with `m` correct answers.
   
2. **Remaining Correct Answers**:
   - `remaining_correct = m % k` gives the number of additional correct answers beyond the complete sets.

3. **Excess Full Sets Check**:
   - The condition `if (m <= n - n // k)` checks if the number of full sets is enough considering the remaining questions. If not, it proceeds to calculate the excess full sets required.
   
4. **Excess Full Sets Calculation**:
   - `excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)` determines how many additional full sets are needed beyond the initial ones.
   
5. **Remaining Correct Answers After Excess Full Sets**:
   - `remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k` accounts for the remaining correct answers after forming the excess full sets.
   
6. **Score Calculation**:
   - The final score is calculated using the formula `(remaining_correct_answers + k * (2^(excess_full_sets) - 1) * 2^(MOD - 2)) % MOD`. This accounts for doubling the score for every full set after the initial ones and adding the remaining correct answers.

Given the detailed breakdown and the logical flow of the code, the function correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible score. There are no obvious logical errors or missing parts in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
