Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program seems to have a logic flaw in how it calculates the score. Specifically, the calculation of `score` in the `func_1` function does not correctly account for the scenario where the number of correct answers `m` exceeds the maximum number of correct answers possible without exceeding the number of questions `n`.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 7`, `m = 8`, `k = 2`

According to the problem description, Manao can answer up to 7 questions correctly, but here `m` is 8. The program should handle this case correctly by considering the maximum possible score without exceeding `n`.

In this specific case, the program will attempt to calculate the score as if `m` were within the limit, which leads to incorrect results. The correct approach would involve ensuring that the score does not exceed the total number of questions available.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the score is capped at `n`. Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
MOD = 1000000009
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k
    remaining_correct = m % k
    if m <= n:
        score = m
    else:
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
        remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
        score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    return score % MOD
```

This revised version ensures that the score is always capped at `n`, which aligns with the problem constraints.
