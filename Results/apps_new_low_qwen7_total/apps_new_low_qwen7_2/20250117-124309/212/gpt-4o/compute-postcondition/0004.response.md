Let's break down the code step by step and determine the final state of the variables.

Initial State:
- `m` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `n` is an integer
- `max_full_sets = m // k`
- `remaining_correct = m % k`
- The condition `(m > n - n // k)` holds true

Code:
```python
excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
```

1. **Calculate `excess_full_sets`:**
   - `excess_full_sets` is calculated as `max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`.
   - Since `max_full_sets = m // k`, we substitute it into the equation:
     \[
     excess_full_sets = m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)
     \]

2. **Calculate `remaining_correct_answers`:**
   - `remaining_correct_answers` is calculated as `m - excess_full_sets * k`.

3. **Calculate `score`:**
   - `score` is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (2^{excess_full_sets} - 1) * 2^{MOD - 2}) \% MOD
     \]
   - We need to ensure that all operations respect the modulo `MOD` property.

Let's combine these steps to find the final state.

### Final Calculations:
1. **`excess_full_sets`:**
   \[
   excess_full_sets = m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)
   \]

2. **`remaining_correct_answers`:**
   \[
   remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
   \]

3. **`score`:**
   \[
   score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (2^{excess_full_sets} - 1) * 2^{MOD - 2}) \% MOD
   \]

### Updated State:
- `max_full_sets` remains unchanged.
- `remaining_correct` remains unchanged.
- `excess_full_sets` is updated based on the calculation above.
- `remaining_correct_answers` is updated based on the calculation above.
- `score` is updated based on the calculation above.

Since the exact values of `m`, `k`, `n`, and `MOD` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values. However, the structure of the final state is clear.

### Output State:
\[
\text{Output State: } \text{`m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `max_full_sets` is } m // k, \text{ `remaining_correct` is } m \% k, \text{ `excess_full_sets` is } m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1), \text{ `remaining_correct_answers` is } m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) * k, \text{ `score` is } (m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) * k + k * (2^{(m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1))} - 1) * 2^{MOD - 2}) \% MOD
\]
