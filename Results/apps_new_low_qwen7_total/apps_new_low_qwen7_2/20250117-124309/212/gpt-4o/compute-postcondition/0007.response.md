The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. These parameters are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n. The function calculates a score using the formula: (m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) * k + k * 2. After executing the function body, the function returns the calculated score.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and return a score calculated based on the given formula.
