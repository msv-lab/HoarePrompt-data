Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n. It calculates a score based on the following steps:
1. Determines the maximum number of full sets (`max_full_sets`) that can be formed with `m` elements, each set containing `k` elements.
2. Calculates the remaining correct elements after forming these full sets (`remaining_correct`).
3. Checks if the number of full sets is sufficient given the constraints involving `n`.
4. If the number of full sets is insufficient, it calculates the excess full sets required (`excess_full_sets`).
5. Computes the number of remaining correct answers (`remaining_correct_answers`) after accounting for the excess full sets.
6. Finally, it calculates the score using the formula: `(remaining_correct_answers + k * (2^(excess_full_sets) - 1) * 2^(MOD - 2)) % MOD`.

The function returns the calculated score. Potential edge cases include when `m` is zero, which would result in no full sets and a score based solely on the excess full sets calculation. Additionally, if `m` is exactly `n` and `k`, the function will still correctly calculate the score.**

Note: The annotation about `2` at the end seems incomplete and should likely be `2^{(m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1))}`.
