Output State: **m is an integer, k is an integer, n is an integer, max_full_sets is m // k, remaining_correct is m % k**

Explanation:
The code calculates two new variables: `max_full_sets` and `remaining_correct`.
- `max_full_sets = m // k`: This line computes the integer division of `m` by `k` and assigns the result to `max_full_sets`. The value of `m` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `remaining_correct = m % k`: This line computes the remainder when `m` is divided by `k` and assigns the result to `remaining_correct`. Again, the values of `m` and `k` remain unchanged.

No other variables are affected by this code block. Therefore, the values of `n` remain as they were in the initial state, and `m` and `k` retain their original integer values.
