The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from standard input, where `n` represents the length of `s` and `s` consists of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It then processes the string `s` to find the maximum count of consecutive lowercase characters, while ignoring uppercase characters. The function prints the maximum count of such consecutive lowercase characters. If there are no consecutive lowercase characters, the output will be 0.
