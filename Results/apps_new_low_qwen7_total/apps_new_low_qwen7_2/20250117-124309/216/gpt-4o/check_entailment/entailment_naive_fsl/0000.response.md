Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions according to the given problem description. It iterates through the string, adding lowercase letters to a set if they are not already present, and clears the set upon encountering an uppercase letter. The maximum size of the set is updated accordingly. This approach ensures that the conditions for a pretty set are met:

1. Letters in the set are distinct and lowercase.
2. There are no uppercase letters between the positions of the letters in the set.

Since the program handles all described cases and edge cases properly, it is correct.
