You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from standard input, where `n` represents the length of `s` and `s` consists of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It then processes the string `s` to find the maximum count of consecutive lowercase characters, while ignoring uppercase characters. The function prints the maximum count of such consecutive lowercase characters. If there are no consecutive lowercase characters, the output will be 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic step by step and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables `max_count` to store the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions, `current_set` to keep track of unique lowercase letters encountered, and `current_count` to count the number of elements in the current pretty set.

2. **Iteration**: The program iterates through each character in the string `s`. For each character:
   - If the character is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, it adds the character to `current_set` and increments `current_count`.
   - If the character is uppercase, it checks the maximum number of elements in the current pretty set (`current_count`) against `max_count` and resets `current_set` and `current_count`.

3. **Final Check**: After the loop ends, the program performs one final check to update `max_count` with the maximum value between `max_count` and `current_count`.

Now, let's verify if this logic meets the problem requirements:

- The program correctly identifies lowercase letters and ensures they are distinct by using a set.
- It correctly handles uppercase letters by resetting the current set and count whenever an uppercase letter is encountered.
- The program maintains the requirement that there should be no uppercase letters between positions in the pretty set.
- The program correctly updates `max_count` at the end to include the last pretty set found in the string.

Given this analysis, the provided solution appears to meet all the requirements of the problem accurately.

Correctness: **True**
