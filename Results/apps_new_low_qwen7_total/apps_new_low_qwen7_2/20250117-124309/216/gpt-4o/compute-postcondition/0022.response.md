Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from standard input, where `n` represents the length of `s` and `s` consists of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It then processes the string `s` to find the maximum count of consecutive lowercase characters, while ignoring uppercase characters. The function prints the maximum count of such consecutive lowercase characters. If there are no consecutive lowercase characters, the output will be 0.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the string `s` contains only uppercase characters, the function will print 0.
- If the string `s` contains no lowercase characters, the function will also print 0.
- If the string `s` is empty, the function will print 0.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not handle the case where the string `s` might contain special characters or digits, although the initial comment suggests that `s` consists of "lowercase and uppercase Latin letters." However, the code itself does not explicitly exclude these other characters; they are simply ignored when processing the string.
