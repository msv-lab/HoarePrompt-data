Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any character in `s`, `current_set` contains all unique characters from `s` that are lowercase, and `current_count` is the count of lowercase characters added to `current_set` during the execution of the if statement. If no lowercase characters are added, `current_count` remains 0.***

This postcondition covers all possible scenarios based on the if and else parts provided, summarizing the state of the program variables after the if-else block executes.
