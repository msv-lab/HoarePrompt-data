Output State: **max_count is the maximum count of any character in s, current_set is an empty set, current_count is 0**

Explanation:
- The first line updates `max_count` to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`. Since `current_count` is reset to 0 later, this line ensures `max_count` retains its maximum value from before or becomes 0 if no characters were counted since the last update.
- The second line clears `current_set`, making it an empty set.
- The third line sets `current_count` to 0, indicating the start of counting characters again. 

Given the initial conditions and the operations performed by the code, these are the updated states of the variables.
