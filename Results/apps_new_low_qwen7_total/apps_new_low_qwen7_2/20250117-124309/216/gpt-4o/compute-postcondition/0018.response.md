Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any character in `s`, `current_set` contains all unique lowercase characters from `s` (including `char` if `char` was not already in `current_set`), `current_count` is the total count of unique lowercase characters in `current_set` incremented by 1 if `char` was not already in `current_set` or reset to 0 if `char` is not a lowercase character, and `char` is the next character in the string `s`.***
