n = int(input())
s = input()
max_count = 0
current_set = set()
current_count = 0
```

Explanation:
- The first line reads an integer `n` from the standard input and stores it in the variable `n`.
- The second line reads a string `s` from the standard input and stores it in the variable `s`.
- The third line initializes the variable `max_count` to 0.
- The fourth line initializes an empty set `current_set`.
- The fifth line initializes the variable `current_count` to 0.

Since the input and variables initialization do not modify the existing variables (no other variables from the initial state are mentioned or affected), the output state remains as follows:
Output State: **max_count is 0, current_set is a set(), current_count is 0, n is an integer, s is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters**
