Initial State: `s` must have at least one character, `char` is a lowercase character, and `char` is not in `current_set`.

Code Snippet:
```
current_set.add(char)
current_count += 1
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `current_set.add(char)` adds the character `char` to the set `current_set`. This operation does not change the number of elements in `current_count`, but it updates the contents of `current_set`.
2. The second line `current_count += 1` increments the integer `current_count` by 1.

Since `char` is a lowercase character not already in `current_set`, `current_set` gains one new element, and `current_count` is incremented by 1.

Final Output State: **`s` must have at least one character, `char` is a lowercase character, and `char` is now in `current_set`, `current_count` is 1 more than its original value**.
