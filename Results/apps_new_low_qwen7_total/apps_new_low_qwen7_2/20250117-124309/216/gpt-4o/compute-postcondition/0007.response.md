Output State: **s is a non-empty string, max_count is 0, current_set is an empty set, current_count is 0**

Explanation:
- The initial state precondition states that `s` must have at least one character, and the character is not lowercase.
- The first line `max_count = max(max_count, current_count)` updates `max_count` to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`. However, since `current_count` is initialized to 0 before this line, and there's no previous value of `max_count` given, `max_count` remains 0 (assuming `max_count` was also initialized to 0 before these lines were executed).
- The second line `current_set.clear()` clears the contents of `current_set`, making it an empty set.
- The third line `current_count = 0` sets `current_count` to 0.
- After executing these lines, `s` remains unchanged, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0.
