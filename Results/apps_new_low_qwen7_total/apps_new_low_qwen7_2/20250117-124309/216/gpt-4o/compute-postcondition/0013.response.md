Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any character in `s`, `current_set` contains all unique lowercase characters from the initial string `s`, and `current_count` is the total count of unique lowercase characters added to `current_set` during the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `char.islower()` evaluates to True, `char` is added to `current_set` and `current_count` is incremented by 1. If the condition is False, `current_set` remains unchanged and `current_count` remains as the count of lowercase characters added during the initial evaluation of `current_set`.***
