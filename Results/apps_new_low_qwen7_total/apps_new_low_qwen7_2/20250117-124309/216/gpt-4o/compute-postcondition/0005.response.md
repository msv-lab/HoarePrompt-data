Postcondition: ***`s` must have at least one character, `char` is a lowercase character. If `char` is not initially in `current_set`, then after the execution, `char` will be in `current_set` and `current_count` will be incremented by 1. If `char` is already in `current_set`, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
