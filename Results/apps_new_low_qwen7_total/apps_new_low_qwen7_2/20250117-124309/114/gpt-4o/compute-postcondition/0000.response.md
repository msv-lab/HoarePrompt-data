Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 8, x is n * (10 ** k)**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates the `multiplier` as \(10^k\).
- The second line computes `x` as `n * (10^k // \mathit{gcd}(n, 10^k))`. Since \(10^k\) is a power of 10, it is always divisible by `n` if `n` is a divisor of 10 (i.e., 1, 2, 5, or 10), or it remains `10^k` otherwise. In all cases, the result of the division is simply \(10^k\). Therefore, `x` is effectively `n * 10^k`.

This means that the value of `x` is `n` multiplied by \(10^k\), while `n` and `k` retain their initial values.
