Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` (an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It calculates the value of `n` multiplied by \(10^k\) and then divides the result by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and \(10^k\). The function returns the final computed value `x`. This process effectively shifts the decimal point of `n` by `k` places to the right, ensuring that the result is an integer. The function handles the case when `k` is 0, which results in the original value of `n` being returned.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `k` is 0, the function simply returns `n` because \(10^0 = 1\), and multiplying `n` by 1 and then dividing by the GCD of `n` and 1 will still yield `n`.
- If `n` and \(10^k\) share a common factor greater than 1, the division by the GCD ensures that the result is the largest possible integer after shifting the decimal point by `k` places.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code correctly implements the described logic but does not explicitly handle the case where `k` is negative. However, since the problem statement specifies \(0 \leq k \leq 8\), negative values of `k` are not within the specified range, so this is not a concern in this specific implementation.
