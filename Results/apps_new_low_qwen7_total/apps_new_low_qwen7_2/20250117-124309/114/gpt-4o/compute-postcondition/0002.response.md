The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. 
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
- `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 8.

After executing the function body, the function returns `x`, which is the result of multiplying `n` by 10.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, and return the value of `n` multiplied by 10.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, returns the value of `n` multiplied by 10.**
