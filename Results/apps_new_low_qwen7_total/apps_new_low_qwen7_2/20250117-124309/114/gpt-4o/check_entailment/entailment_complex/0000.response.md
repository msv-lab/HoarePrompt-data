Reasoning:
The provided code aims to find the k-rounding of a given positive integer \( n \). Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness step by step:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is defined correctly to accept two parameters: \( n \) (a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)) and \( k \) (an integer such that \( 0 \leq k \leq 8 \)).
   - The variable `multiplier` is set to \( 10^k \), which is the correct base for determining the number of trailing zeros.

2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   - The GCD of \( n \) and \( 10^k \) is calculated using `math.gcd(n, multiplier)`.
   - The expression \( n \times (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)) \) ensures that the result is the smallest multiple of \( n \) that has at least \( k \) trailing zeros.

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   - Multiplying \( n \) by \( 10^k \) gives a number with \( k \) trailing zeros.
   - Dividing by the GCD ensures that the result is the smallest such multiple of \( n \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \( k = 0 \), \( 10^k = 1 \), and the GCD is also 1, so the result is simply \( n \).
   - For larger values of \( k \), the GCD will ensure that the result is the smallest multiple of \( n \) with at least \( k \) trailing zeros.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the example inputs:
     - `375 4`: \( 375 \times 10000 = 3750000 \), and the GCD of 375 and 10000 is 125, so \( 375 \times (10000 // 125) = 375 \times 80 = 30000 \).
     - `10000 1`: \( 10000 \times 10 = 100000 \), and the GCD of 10000 and 10 is 10, so \( 10000 \times (10 // 10) = 10000 \).
     - `38101 0`: The GCD of 38101 and 1 is 1, so the result is 38101.
     - `123456789 8`: \( 123456789 \times 100000000 = 12345678900000000 \), and the GCD of 123456789 and 100000000 is 1, so the result is \( 123456789 \times 100000000 = 12345678900000000 \).

Given the logic and the verification of the examples, the provided program correctly implements the k-rounding functionality.

Correctness: **True**
