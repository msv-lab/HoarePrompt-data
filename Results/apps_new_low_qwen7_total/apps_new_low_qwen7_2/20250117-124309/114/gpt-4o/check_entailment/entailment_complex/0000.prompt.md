Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
For a given positive integer n denote its k-rounding as the minimum positive integer x, such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

For example, 4-rounding of 375 is 375·80 = 30000. 30000 is the minimum integer such that it ends with 4 or more zeros and is divisible by 375.

Write a program that will perform the k-rounding of n.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ k ≤ 8).


-----Output-----

Print the k-rounding of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
375 4

Output
30000

Input
10000 1

Output
10000

Input
38101 0

Output
38101

Input
123456789 8

Output
12345678900000000

# Annotated Program:
import math

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 8.
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k

x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is n * (10) where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9 and x is the result of this multiplication
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` (an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It calculates the value of `n` multiplied by \(10^k\) and then divides the result by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and \(10^k\). The function returns the final computed value `x`. This process effectively shifts the decimal point of `n` by `k` places to the right, ensuring that the result is an integer. The function handles the case when `k` is 0, which results in the original value of `n` being returned.
