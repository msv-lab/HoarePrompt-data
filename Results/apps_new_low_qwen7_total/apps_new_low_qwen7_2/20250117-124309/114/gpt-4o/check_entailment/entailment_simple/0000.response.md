### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the smallest integer `x` that is greater than or equal to `n` and ends with at least `k` zeros in its decimal representation, and is also divisible by `n`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n, k)` is supposed to compute this value.
   - It calculates a `multiplier` which is `10 ** k`.
   - It then computes `x` using the formula `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The expression `math.gcd(n, multiplier)` finds the greatest common divisor of `n` and `10 ** k`. This ensures that the resulting `x` is minimized while still ending in `k` zeros and being divisible by `n`.

4. **Formula Explanation**: 
   - `10 ** k` gives us the smallest number with exactly `k` zeros.
   - Dividing `10 ** k` by `math.gcd(n, 10 ** k)` ensures that the resulting number is the smallest multiple of `10 ** k` that is also a multiple of `n`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - If `n` itself ends with at least `k` zeros, then `x = n`.
   - Otherwise, `x` will be `n` multiplied by the smallest power of 10 necessary to make `x` end with `k` zeros and still be divisible by `n`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `k = 0`, the function correctly returns `n` because no additional zeros are needed.
   - For `n` already ending with `k` zeros, the function also works as intended.
   - For large values of `n` and `k`, the calculation remains valid as long as `10 ** k` does not overflow, which it won't for the given constraints (`10 ** 8` is within bounds).

Given these points, the logic in the provided code is sound and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
