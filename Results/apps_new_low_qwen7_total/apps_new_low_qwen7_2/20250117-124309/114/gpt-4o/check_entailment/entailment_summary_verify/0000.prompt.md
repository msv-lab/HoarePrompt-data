You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
For a given positive integer n denote its k-rounding as the minimum positive integer x, such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

For example, 4-rounding of 375 is 375·80 = 30000. 30000 is the minimum integer such that it ends with 4 or more zeros and is divisible by 375.

Write a program that will perform the k-rounding of n.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ k ≤ 8).


-----Output-----

Print the k-rounding of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
375 4

Output
30000

Input
10000 1

Output
10000

Input
38101 0

Output
38101

Input
123456789 8

Output
12345678900000000

- Program:
import math

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` (an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It calculates the value of `n` multiplied by \(10^k\) and then divides the result by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and \(10^k\). The function returns the final computed value `x`. This process effectively shifts the decimal point of `n` by `k` places to the right, ensuring that the result is an integer. The function handles the case when `k` is 0, which results in the original value of `n` being returned.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the given `k` is greater than the number of trailing zeros in the smallest multiple of `n` that ends with `k` zeros. Specifically, for the input `123456789 8`, the program will produce `12345678900000000`, which is incorrect because the correct 8-rounding of `123456789` is `123456789000000000`.

The issue arises because the program calculates the multiplier as `10 ** k` and then multiplies `n` by this value divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `n` and `10 ** k`. This approach does not guarantee that the result is the minimum positive integer that ends with `k` or more zeros and is divisible by `n`. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that the multiplier is adjusted to the smallest power of 10 that is at least `10 ** k` and is also a multiple of `n`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1(n, k):
    # Find the smallest power of 10 that is at least 10^k and is a multiple of n
    multiplier = 10 ** (k + int(math.log10(n) - math.floor(math.log10(n)) + 1))
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))
```

This corrected version ensures that the multiplier is the smallest power of 10 that is a multiple of `n` and has at least `k` trailing zeros, thus meeting the problem requirements accurately.
