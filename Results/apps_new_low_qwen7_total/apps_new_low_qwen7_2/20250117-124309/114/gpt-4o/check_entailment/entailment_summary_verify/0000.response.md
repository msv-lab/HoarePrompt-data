### Reasoning:

The original assessment incorrectly identified a problem with the program that does not actually exist in the given implementation. Let's analyze the function `func_1` and the problem requirements step-by-step:

1. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` calculates the value of `n` multiplied by \(10^k\) and then divides the result by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and \(10^k\). This process effectively shifts the decimal point of `n` by `k` places to the right, ensuring that the result is an integer.

2. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: \(k = 0\)**: The function returns `n`, which is correct since \(10^0 = 1\).
   - **Case 2: \(k > 0\)**: The function computes \(10^k\) and then divides \(n \times 10^k\) by \(\text{gcd}(n, 10^k)\). This ensures that the result is the smallest integer that ends with at least `k` zeros and is divisible by `n`.
     - For example, if `n = 375` and `k = 4`, the function computes \(10^4 = 10000\) and \(\text{gcd}(375, 10000) = 125\). Thus, the result is \(375 \times 80 = 30000\), which is the smallest integer ending with 4 zeros and divisible by 375.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases like `n = 123456789` and `k = 8`, producing `12345678900000000`, which is indeed the smallest integer ending with 8 zeros and divisible by 123456789.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the k-rounding of `n`. The original assessment incorrectly flagged an issue that does not affect the current implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
