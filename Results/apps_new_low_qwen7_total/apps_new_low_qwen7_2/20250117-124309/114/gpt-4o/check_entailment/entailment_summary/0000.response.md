Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic for k-rounding. Let's break down the process:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the standard input.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n, k)` is defined to perform the k-rounding.
3. **Multiplier Calculation**: `multiplier = 10 ** k` computes the value of \(10^k\).
4. **GCD Calculation**: `math.gcd(n, multiplier)` computes the greatest common divisor of `n` and \(10^k\).
5. **Result Computation**: The expression `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` calculates the smallest multiple of `n` that ends with at least `k` zeros. This works because dividing by the GCD removes any common factors between `n` and \(10^k\), ensuring the result is the smallest such multiple.

This approach is sound and should work for all valid inputs within the specified ranges. The execution summary accurately describes the function's behavior.

Given the logical correctness and the described behavior, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
