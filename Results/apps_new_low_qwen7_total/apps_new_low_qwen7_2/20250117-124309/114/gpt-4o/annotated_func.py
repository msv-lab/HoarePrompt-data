#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 8.
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k

x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is n * (10) where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9 and x is the result of this multiplication
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` (an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It calculates the value of `n` multiplied by \(10^k\) and then divides the result by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and \(10^k\). The function returns the final computed value `x`. This process effectively shifts the decimal point of `n` by `k` places to the right, ensuring that the result is an integer. The function handles the case when `k` is 0, which results in the original value of `n` being returned.
