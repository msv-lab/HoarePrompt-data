Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string $s$.

Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $n$ which contain $s$ as a substring.

The cyclical string $t$ contains $s$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $t$, such that $s$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $t$.

For example, the cyclical string "000111" contains substrings "001", "01110" and "10", but doesn't contain "0110" and "10110".

Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 40$) — the length of the target string $t$.

The next line contains the string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le n$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $t$. String $s$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $t$, which contain $s$ as a substring.


-----Examples-----

1010

Input
20
10101010101010

Output
962


-----Note-----

In the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain "0" — "00", "01" and "10".

In the second example, there are only two such strings — "1010", "0101".

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, and s is a string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n, containing only the characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    n = int(input())

s = input()

count = 0
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        t = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)
        
        if all(t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n)):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count` is the total number of integers `i` from 0 to \(2^n - 1\) such that the binary string representation of `i` of length `n` satisfies the condition that either a substring of length `len(s)` or a circular shift of this substring equals `s`. `n` and `s` remain unchanged.
    print(count)
