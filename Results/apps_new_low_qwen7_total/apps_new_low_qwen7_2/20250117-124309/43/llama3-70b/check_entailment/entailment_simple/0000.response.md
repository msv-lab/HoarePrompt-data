### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the string `s` as specified in the problem statement.
   
2. **Cyclical String Generation and Check**:
   - The program generates all possible binary strings of length `n` using a loop that iterates over all integers from `0` to \(2^n - 1\). Each integer is converted to a binary string of length `n` using `bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)`.
   - For each generated binary string `t`, it checks whether `s` is a substring of `t` or if a cyclic shift of `s` is a substring of `t`.

3. **Substring and Circular Shift Check**:
   - The condition `all(t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n))` ensures that for every possible starting position `i` within the string `t`, either a substring of length `len(s)` starting at `i` matches `s`, or a circular shift of `s` is found when splitting `t` at `i` and comparing parts.
   - This effectively checks both direct and circular substring conditions for `s` in `t`.

4. **Counting Valid Strings**:
   - The variable `count` keeps track of how many such binary strings satisfy the conditions. After iterating through all possible strings, the final value of `count` is printed.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total count of distinct cyclical binary strings that contain `s` as a substring, which matches the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The provided code accurately implements the logic to find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length `n` that contain the string `s` as a substring. There are no apparent logical errors in the code based on the given problem constraints and examples.

**Correctness:** **True**
