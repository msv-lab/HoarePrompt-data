The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40) and `s` (a string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n, containing only the characters '0' and '1'). The function calculates and prints the number of integers `i` from 0 to \(2^n - 1\) such that the binary string representation of `i` of length `n` contains a substring of length `|s|` or a circular shift of this substring equal to `s`. The function does not return a value; instead, it prints the result directly.
