To determine the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 40\)
- `s` is a string such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq n\) and contains only the characters '0' and '1'
- `count` is 0

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2 ** n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over the range from `0` to \(2^n - 1\). This means `i` will take on all integer values from `0` to \(2^n - 1` during each iteration.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is already defined and within the specified range.
   - `s` is already defined and meets the length requirement relative to `n`.
   - `count` is already initialized to `0`.

3. **First Iteration Condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than \(2^n\).
   - Initially, `i` is set to `0` because the range function starts at `0` by default.

4. **Required States for First Execution**:
   - `i` must be `0` to satisfy the condition `i < 2^n`.
   - There are no additional constraints on `n`, `s`, or `count` for the loop to start executing.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the only state that needs to be modified (or ensured) is `i`, which should be `0`.

### Final State:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, `s` is a string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n and contains only the characters '0' and '1', `count` is 0**
