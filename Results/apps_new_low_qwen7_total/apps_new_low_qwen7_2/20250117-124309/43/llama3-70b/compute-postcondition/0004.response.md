`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `i`, `n`, `s`, `t`, and the conditions related to `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, `s` is a string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n and contains only the characters '0' and '1', `count` is 1, `t` is a string of `n` zeros, and all substrings of `t` starting at index `i` and having the same length as `s` are equal to `s` or the suffix of `t` starting from index `i + len(s)` concatenated with the prefix of `t` up to index `i` is equal to `s`.
