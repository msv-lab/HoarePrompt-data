`count` is incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2; `n` remains the same; `s` remains the same; `count` is increased by 1; `t` is the binary string '10' padded with leading zeros to make its length `n`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` remains the same; `s` remains the same; `count` is increased by 1; `t` is the binary string '10' padded with leading zeros to make its length `n`.**
