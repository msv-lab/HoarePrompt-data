### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the given program, let's analyze each function step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is used to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - The function correctly computes the GCD and also finds integer coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \text{GCD}(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function aims to find the number of integers \(x\) within the range \([L, R]\) that satisfy both arithmetic progressions \(x = a_1k + b_1\) and \(x = a_2l + b_2\).
   - It uses the result from `func_1` to solve the linear Diophantine equation \(A x + B y = C\), where \(A = a_1\), \(B = -a_2\), and \(C = b_2 - b_1\).
   - If the GCD of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) does not divide \(C\), there are no solutions, and it returns `-1`.
   - The function then adjusts the solution to account for the constraints of the arithmetic progressions and counts how many valid solutions fall within the range \([L, R]\).

3. **Function `adjust_solution`:**
   - This function adjusts the initial solution \((x_0, y_0)\) to ensure that the value \(x = a_1 x_0 + b_1\) lies within the range \([L, R]\).
   - It handles cases where the value might be out of bounds by adjusting \(x_0\) and \(y_0\) accordingly.

### Verification:
- **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD and the coefficients.
- **Linear Diophantine Equation Solution**: The `func_2` function correctly solves the linear Diophantine equation and accounts for the constraints.
- **Range Adjustment**: The `adjust_solution` function ensures that the final values lie within the specified range.

Given the logical flow and the implementation details, the provided code appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, we can conclude that the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
