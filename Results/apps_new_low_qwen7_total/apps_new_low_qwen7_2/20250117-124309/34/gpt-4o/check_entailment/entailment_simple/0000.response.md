Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the GCD of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm and also finds the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
   - It correctly implements the extended Euclidean algorithm and returns the necessary values.

2. **Function `func_2(a1, b1, a2, b2, L, R)`**:
   - This function calculates the GCD of `a1` and `-a2` and uses the results to find a solution to the equation `a1*x + (-a2)*y = gcd(a1, -a2)`.
   - It checks if `b2 - b1` is divisible by the GCD, which is essential for a solution to exist.
   - The function then adjusts the solution using the `adjust_solution` function and iterates to count the number of valid solutions in the range `[L, R]`.

3. **Function `adjust_solution(x, y, a1_div_gcd, a2_div_gcd, sign_a1, sign_a2)`**:
   - This function ensures that the solution `x` and `y` are adjusted to fall within the valid range `[L, R]`.
   - It correctly handles the adjustments based on the signs of `a1` and `a2` and ensures that `x` and `y` remain valid.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic to find the number of integers `x` in the range `[L, R]` that satisfy both arithmetic progressions is sound.
   - The use of the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the initial solution and the subsequent adjustments ensure correctness.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program correctly implements the required functionality without any logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
