Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. It also finds the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. The function handles the case where `a` is zero but not where `b` is zero, which is fine given the constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses the result from `func_1` to solve the main problem. It correctly handles the case where `C = b2 - b1` is not divisible by the GCD, returning -1 if this is the case. It then adjusts the solution based on the signs of `A` and `B`. The loop ensures that all possible values of `x` are considered within the given range `[L, R]`.

3. **Function `adjust_solution`**: This function adjusts the solution based on the conditions involving `b1`, `a1`, `L`, and `R`. It ensures that the value `b1 + a1 * x` falls within the range `[L, R]` after each adjustment.

Given the problem statement and the provided functions, the overall approach is correct. The functions handle the GCD calculation, check divisibility, and ensure that the final value `x` satisfies the given constraints. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities that would make the program incorrect based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
