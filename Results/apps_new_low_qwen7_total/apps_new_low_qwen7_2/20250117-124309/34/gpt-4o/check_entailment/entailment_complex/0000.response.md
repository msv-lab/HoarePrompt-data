Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`, and the corresponding coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
   - The base case and recursive logic are sound, though there is a minor edge case not handled explicitly (when `b` is zero, the GCD should be `a` and the coefficients should be `1` and `0` respectively).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function first checks if the constant term difference (`C`) is divisible by the GCD of the coefficients. If not, it returns -1, which is a valid check since solutions cannot exist in this case.
   - It then correctly adjusts the coefficients `x0` and `y0` using the GCD and the signs of `a1` and `a2`.
   - The loop iterates to find all valid integer solutions `x` within the range `[L, R]` that satisfy the given equations. The adjustment of `x0` and `y0` ensures that the loop considers all possible valid values of `x`.

3. **Function `adjust_solution`**:
   - This function adjusts the values of `x` and `y` to ensure they fall within the required range `[L, R]` based on the linear equation `b1 + a1 * x`.
   - The logic for adjusting `x` and `y` is correct and ensures that the solutions are valid within the given constraints.

Given the analysis, the functions collectively work together to solve the problem as described. The primary concerns about potential edge cases (e.g., when `b` is zero) are mitigated by the checks and adjustments in the functions. The overall logic and flow of the program align with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
