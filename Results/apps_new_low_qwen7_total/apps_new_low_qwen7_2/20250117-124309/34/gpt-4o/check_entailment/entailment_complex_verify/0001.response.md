### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute the GCD and the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \text{GCD}(a, b)\).
   - **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles the case where \(a = 0\) by returning \(b, 0, 1\). However, it does not explicitly handle the case where \(b = 0\). In practice, if \(b = 0\), the GCD would be \(a\) and the coefficients would be \(1, 0\) respectively. This is a minor oversight but does not affect the overall correctness since the inputs are constrained to ensure non-zero \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **GCD Check**: The function correctly checks if \(C = b_2 - b_1\) is divisible by the GCD of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\). If not, it returns `-1`, indicating no solutions exist.
   - **Adjustment of Coefficients**: The function adjusts the initial solution \((x_0, y_0)\) to account for the signs of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).
   - **Loop to Count Solutions**: The loop iterates to find all valid solutions \(x\) within the range \([L, R]\). It correctly updates \(x_0\) and \(y_0\) and increments the count whenever \(x\) is within the range.
   - **Adjust Solution Function**: The `adjust_solution` function ensures that the value \(x = a_1 x_0 + b_1\) lies within the range \([L, R]\) by adjusting \(x_0\) and \(y_0\) appropriately.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program follows the steps to compute the GCD, solve the linear Diophantine equation, and count the number of valid solutions within the given range.
   - The use of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and the loop to iterate over possible values ensures that all valid solutions are counted correctly.

### Verification:
- **GCD Calculation**: Correct.
- **Linear Diophantine Equation Solution**: Correct.
- **Range Adjustment and Counting**: Correct.

Given the logical flow and the implementation details, the provided code appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The program handles all necessary cases and ensures that the final count of valid solutions is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
