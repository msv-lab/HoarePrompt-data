- The function handles the case where `C` is not divisible by the GCD by returning -1, ensuring that the subsequent calculations do not proceed if the conditions are not met.
- The function ensures that `x0` and `y0` are correctly adjusted based on the signs of `A` and `B` to maintain the relationship between the variables.
- The loop continues until `val` exceeds `R`, ensuring that all possible valid values are considered within the given range.
