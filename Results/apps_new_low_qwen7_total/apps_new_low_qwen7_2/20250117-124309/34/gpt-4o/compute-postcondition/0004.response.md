Postcondition: ***x and y are integers, a1_div_gcd and a2_div_gcd are positive integers, sign_a1 and sign_a2 are either 1 or -1, and L and R are integers such that L â‰¤ R. If sign_a1 > 0, x is updated by adding k * a2_div_gcd where k = (L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd), and y is updated by subtracting k * a1_div_gcd. a1_div_gcd and a2_div_gcd remain unchanged, sign_a1 and sign_a2 remain unchanged, and L and R remain unchanged. Otherwise, x and y are updated to their new values, a1_div_gcd and a2_div_gcd remain unchanged, sign_a1 and sign_a2 remain unchanged, and L and R remain unchanged.***
