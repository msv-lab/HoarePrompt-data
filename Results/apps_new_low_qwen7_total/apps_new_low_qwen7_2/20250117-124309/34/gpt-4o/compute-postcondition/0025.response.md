`count` is incremented by 1. The values of `x0`, `y0`, `val`, and `R` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `x0` is `x0 - 3`, `y0` is `y0 - 2`, `val` is `a1 * (x0 - 3) + b1`, `R` is unchanged, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`x0` is `x0 - 3`, `y0` is `y0 - 2`, `val` is `a1 * (x0 - 3) + b1`, `R` is unchanged, `count` is increased by 1.**
