Postcondition: ***x and y are integers. If \( b1 + a1 \times x < L \), then \( x \) is updated to its original value plus \( a2\_div\_gcd \) and \( y \) is updated to its original value minus \( a1\_div\_gcd \). Both \( a1\_div\_gcd \) and \( a2\_div\_gcd \) remain unchanged, as do \( sign\_a1 \), \( sign\_a2 \), \( L \), and \( R \). Otherwise, \( x \) and \( y \) retain their updated values from the if condition, and \( a1\_div\_gcd \), \( a2\_div\_gcd \), \( sign\_a1 \), \( sign\_a2 \), \( L \), and \( R \) remain unchanged.***
