Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers. \( b1 + a1 \times x \) is greater than \( R \). Both \( a1\_div\_gcd \), \( a2\_div\_gcd \), \( sign\_a1 \), \( sign\_a2 \), \( L \), and \( R \) remain unchanged. The current value of \( x \) is updated to its original value plus \( a2\_div\_gcd \) and the current value of \( y \) is updated to its original value minus \( a1\_div\_gcd \).***
