`val` is assigned the value of `a1 * x0 + b1`. The values of `x0` and `y0` are updated to `x0 - 3` and `y0 - 2` respectively, so the new value of `x0` is `x0 - 3` and the new value of `y0` is `y0 - 2`. The value of `a1` and `b1` are used in the calculation but their specific values are not provided, so they remain as they are.

Output State: **`x0` is `x0 - 3`, `y0` is `y0 - 2`, `val` is `a1 * (x0 - 3) + b1**
