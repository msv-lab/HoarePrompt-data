The initial state is given as follows:
- `a1` is 6
- `b1` is 3
- `a2` is -9
- `b2` is 12
- `L` is 10
- `R` is 20
- `A` is 6
- `B` is 9
- `C` is 9
- `gcd` is 3
- `x0` is unchanged
- `y0` is unchanged

The provided code snippet is:
```python
x0 += a2_div_gcd
y0 -= a1_div_gcd
```

However, there are no initial assignments for `a2_div_gcd` and `a1_div_gcd` in the provided code or initial state. We can infer that these should be computed as `a2 / gcd` and `a1 / gcd`, respectively. Given `a2 = -9` and `gcd = 3`, we get `a2_div_gcd = -9 / 3 = -3`. Similarly, given `a1 = 6` and `gcd = 3`, we get `a1_div_gcd = 6 / 3 = 2`.

Let's apply these values to the code:
1. `x0 += a2_div_gcd` implies `x0 += -3`.
2. `y0 -= a1_div_gcd` implies `y0 -= 2`.

Since `x0` and `y0` were initially unchanged, we need to calculate their new values:
- `x0` becomes `x0 - 3`.
- `y0` becomes `y0 - 2`.

Given the initial state of `x0` and `y0` is unchanged (which means they are still the same as when defined), let's assume they were initially set to some default value (though it's not specified, it doesn't affect the computation since they are updated directly). For simplicity, we'll denote the unchanged values as `x0` and `y0` without specifying their exact initial values.

Thus, the updated state is:
- `x0` becomes `x0 - 3`
- `y0` becomes `y0 - 2`

The output state after executing the provided code is:
Output State: **x0 is x0 - 3, y0 is y0 - 2**
