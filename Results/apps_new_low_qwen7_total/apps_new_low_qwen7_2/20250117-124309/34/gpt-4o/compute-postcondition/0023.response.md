The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement we were inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement affecting the variables `x0`, `y0`, and `val`, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x0` is `x0 - 3`, `y0` is `y0 - 2`, `val` is `a1 * (x0 - 3) + b1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
