Output State: **`x` is updated to its original value plus \( a2\_div\_gcd \) if \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \), otherwise `x` is updated to its original value minus \( a2\_div\_gcd \). `y` is updated to its original value minus \( a1\_div\_gcd \) if \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \), otherwise `y` is updated to its original value plus \( a1\_div\_gcd \)**
