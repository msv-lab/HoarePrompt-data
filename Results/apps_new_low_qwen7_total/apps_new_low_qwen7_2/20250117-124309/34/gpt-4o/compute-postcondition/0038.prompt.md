You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a1, b1, a2, b2, L, and R are integers such that 0 < a1, a2 ≤ 2·10^9, -2·10^9 ≤ b1, b2, L, R ≤ 2·10^9, and L ≤ R.
def func_2(a1, b1, a2, b2, L, R):
    A = a1

C = b2 - b1

gcd, x0, y0 = func_1(abs(A), abs(B))
    if (C % gcd != 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: a1 is a1, b1 is b1, a2 is a2, b2 is b2, L is L, R is R, A is a1, B is -a2, C is b2 - b1, gcd is result of func_1(abs(a1), abs(-a2)), x0 is result of func_1(abs(a1), abs(-a2)), y0 is result of func_1(abs(a1), abs(-a2)), C is divisible by gcd
    x0 *= C // gcd

y0 *= C // gcd
    if (A < 0) :
        x0 = -x0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a1` is `a1`, `b1` is `b1`, `a2` is `a2`, `b2` is `b2`, `L` is `L`, `R` is `R`, `A` is `a1`, `B` is `-a2`, `C` is `b2 - b1`, `gcd` is the result of `func_1(abs(a1), abs(-a2))`. If `A` (which is `a1`) is less than 0, `x0` is updated to `-x0 * (C // gcd)`. Otherwise, `x0` remains as `x0 * (C // gcd)` and `y0` remains unchanged.

Otherwise, `x0` remains as `x0 * (C // gcd)` and `y0` remains unchanged.

count = 0
    while True:
        val = a1 * x0 + b1
        
        if val > R:
            break
        
        if L <= val <= R:
            count += 1

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: x0 is (x1 - 3) + 9 * a2_div_gcd, y0 is y0 - 9 * a1_div_gcd, val is a1 * ((x0 - 3) + 9 * a2_div_gcd) + b1, R is unchanged, count is increased by 1 for each iteration where L <= val <= R, gcd is unchanged, a1 is unchanged, b1 is unchanged, a2 is unchanged, b2 is unchanged, L is unchanged, A is unchanged, B is unchanged, C is unchanged, x0 and y0 are updated as described above based on the number of iterations.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop continues indefinitely until `val` exceeds `R`. Each iteration updates `x0` by adding `a2_div_gcd` and `y0` by subtracting `a1_div_gcd`.
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
    #   - `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `L`, `R`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `gcd`, `x0`, and `y0` change.
    #   - `val` changes with each iteration but its exact value depends on the current `x0` and `y0`.
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: 
    #   - `x0` starts at `x0` and increases by `a2_div_gcd` each time the loop runs.
    #   - `y0` starts at `y0` and decreases by `a1_div_gcd` each time the loop runs.
    #   - `count` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `L <= val <= R`.
    #   - The loop will continue to run until `val` becomes greater than `R`.
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: 
    #   - After `n` iterations, `x0` is `x0 - 3 + n * a2_div_gcd` and `y0` is `y0 - n * a1_div_gcd`.
    #   - The relationship between `x0` and `y0` and their initial values ensures the loop's behavior.
    #
    #Since the loop condition is `val > R` and we need to account for the maximum possible iterations, the final state will be after the loop exits, i.e., when `val > R`. Given the initial conditions and the increment/decrement of `x0` and `y0`, the final state can be expressed as shown above.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is incremented by 1 for each iteration where L <= val <= R, with val calculated as a1 * ((x0 - 3) + 9 * a2_div_gcd) + b1, and x0 and y0 updated as x0 = x0 - 3 + n * a2_div_gcd and y0 = y0 - n * a1_div_gcd after n iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts six parameters: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `L`, and `R`. These parameters are integers such that \(0 < a1, a2 \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), \(-2 \cdot 10^9 \leq b1, b2, L, R \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), and \(L \leq R\).
#
#Output:
#- Case_1: The function returns -1.
#- Case_2: The function returns a count, which is incremented by 1 for each iteration where \(L \leq val \leq R\). Here, \(val\) is calculated as \(a1 \times ((x0 - 3) + 9 \times \frac{a2}{\text{gcd}(a1, a2)}) + b1\), and \(x0\) and \(y0\) are updated as \(x0 = x0 - 3 + n \times \frac{a2}{\text{gcd}(a1, a2)}\) and \(y0 = y0 - n \times \frac{a1}{\text{gcd}(a1, a2)}\) after \(n\) iterations.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept six integer parameters and return either -1 or a count based on the specified conditions and calculations.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns count which is incremented by 1 for each iteration where L <= val <= R, with val calculated as a1 * ((x0 - 3) + 9 * a2_div_gcd) + b1, and x0 and y0 updated as x0 = x0 - 3 + n * a2_div_gcd and y0 = y0 - n * a1_div_gcd after n iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
