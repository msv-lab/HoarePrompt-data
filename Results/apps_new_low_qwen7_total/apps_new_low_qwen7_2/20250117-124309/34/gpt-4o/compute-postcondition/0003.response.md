Output State: **x is updated to the new value, y is updated to the new value, a1_div_gcd is unchanged, a2_div_gcd is unchanged, sign_a1 is unchanged, sign_a2 is unchanged, L is unchanged, R is unchanged**

Explanation:
1. The first line calculates `k` using the formula `(R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)`. This value is derived based on the initial state and the given formula but does not have specific initial values for `b1`, `a1`, and `x`, so we cannot simplify further without those values.
2. The second line updates `x` by adding `k * a2_div_gcd` to its current value. This modifies `x` based on the calculated value of `k`.
3. The third line updates `y` by subtracting `k * a1_div_gcd` from its current value. This modifies `y` based on the same value of `k`.

Since `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `sign_a2`, `L`, and `R` are not modified by the code, they remain unchanged. `x` and `y` are updated based on the calculation involving `k`.
