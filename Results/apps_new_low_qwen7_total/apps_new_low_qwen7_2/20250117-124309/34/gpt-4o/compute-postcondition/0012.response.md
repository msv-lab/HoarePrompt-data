The function `adjust_solution` accepts the following parameters:
- `x` and `y` are integers.
- `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd` are positive integers representing the division of `a1` and `a2` by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
- `sign_a1` is either 1 or -1 indicating the sign of `a1`.
- `sign_a2` is either 1 or -1 indicating the sign of `a2`.
- `L` and `R` are integers such that `L â‰¤ R`.

After executing the function body, if \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \), then `x` is updated to its original value plus `a2_div_gcd`, otherwise `x` is updated to its original value minus `a2_div_gcd`. Similarly, if \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \), then `y` is updated to its original value minus `a1_div_gcd`, otherwise `y` is updated to its original value plus `a1_div_gcd`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `adjust_solution` is to accept parameters `x`, `y`, `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `sign_a2`, and update `x` and `y` based on the condition \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x`, `y`, `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, and `sign_a2`, and updates `x` and `y` based on the condition \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \).**
