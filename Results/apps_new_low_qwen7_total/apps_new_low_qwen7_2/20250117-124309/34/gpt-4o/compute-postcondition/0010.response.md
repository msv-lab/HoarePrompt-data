Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers. If \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \), then \( x \) is updated to its original value plus \( a2\_div\_gcd \) and \( y \) is updated to its original value minus \( a1\_div\_gcd \). Both \( a1\_div\_gcd \), \( a2\_div\_gcd \), \( sign\_a1 \), \( sign\_a2 \), \( L \), and \( R \) remain unchanged. Otherwise, \( x \) is updated to its original value minus \( a2\_div\_gcd \) and \( y \) is updated to its original value plus \( a1\_div\_gcd \), and \( a1\_div\_gcd \), \( a2\_div\_gcd \), \( sign\_a1 \), \( sign\_a2 \), \( L \), and \( R \) remain unchanged.***
