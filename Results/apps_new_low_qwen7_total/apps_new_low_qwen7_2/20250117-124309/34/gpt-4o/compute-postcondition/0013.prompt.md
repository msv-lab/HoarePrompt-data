You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, a1_div_gcd and a2_div_gcd are positive integers representing the division of a1 and a2 by their greatest common divisor (gcd), sign_a1 is either 1 or -1 indicating the sign of a1, and sign_a2 is either 1 or -1 indicating the sign of a2. Additionally, L and R are integers such that L ≤ R.
def adjust_solution(x, y, a1_div_gcd, a2_div_gcd, sign_a1, sign_a2):
    if (sign_a1 > 0) :
        k = (L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)

x += k * a2_div_gcd

y -= k * a1_div_gcd
    else :
        k = (R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)

x += k * a2_div_gcd

y -= k * a1_div_gcd
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *x and y are integers, a1_div_gcd and a2_div_gcd are positive integers, sign_a1 and sign_a2 are either 1 or -1, and L and R are integers such that L ≤ R. If sign_a1 > 0, x is updated by adding k * a2_div_gcd where k = (L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd), and y is updated by subtracting k * a1_div_gcd. a1_div_gcd and a2_div_gcd remain unchanged, sign_a1 and sign_a2 remain unchanged, and L and R remain unchanged. Otherwise, x and y are updated to their new values, a1_div_gcd and a2_div_gcd remain unchanged, sign_a1 and sign_a2 remain unchanged, and L and R remain unchanged.
    if (b1 + a1 * x < L) :
        x += a2_div_gcd

y -= a1_div_gcd
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *x and y are integers. If \( b1 + a1 \times x < L \), then \( x \) is updated to its original value plus \( a2\_div\_gcd \) and \( y \) is updated to its original value minus \( a1\_div\_gcd \). Both \( a1\_div\_gcd \) and \( a2\_div\_gcd \) remain unchanged, as do \( sign\_a1 \), \( sign\_a2 \), \( L \), and \( R \). Otherwise, \( x \) and \( y \) retain their updated values from the if condition, and \( a1\_div\_gcd \), \( a2\_div\_gcd \), \( sign\_a1 \), \( sign\_a2 \), \( L \), and \( R \) remain unchanged.
    if (b1 + a1 * x > R) :
        x -= a2_div_gcd

y += a1_div_gcd
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`x` and `y` are integers. If \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \), then \( x \) is updated to its original value plus \( a2\_div\_gcd \) and \( y \) is updated to its original value minus \( a1\_div\_gcd \). Both \( a1\_div\_gcd \), \( a2\_div\_gcd \), \( sign\_a1 \), \( sign\_a2 \), \( L \), and \( R \) remain unchanged. Otherwise, \( x \) is updated to its original value minus \( a2\_div\_gcd \) and \( y \) is updated to its original value plus \( a1\_div\_gcd \), and \( a1\_div\_gcd \), \( a2\_div\_gcd \), \( sign\_a1 \), \( sign\_a2 \), \( L \), and \( R \) remain unchanged.
    return x, y
    #`x` is updated to its original value plus \( a2\_div\_gcd \) if \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \), otherwise `x` is updated to its original value minus \( a2\_div\_gcd \). `y` is updated to its original value minus \( a1\_div\_gcd \) if \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \), otherwise `y` is updated to its original value plus \( a1\_div\_gcd \)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `x`, `y`, `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, and `sign_a2`, and updates `x` and `y` based on the condition \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \).

```

Return Postconditions: `x` is updated to its original value plus \( a2\_div\_gcd \) if \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \), otherwise `x` is updated to its original value minus \( a2\_div\_gcd \). `y` is updated to its original value minus \( a1\_div\_gcd \) if \( b1 + a1 \times x \leq R \), otherwise `y` is updated to its original value plus \( a1\_div\_gcd \)


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
