Postcondition: ***x and y are integers, a1_div_gcd and a2_div_gcd are positive integers, sign_a1 and sign_a2 are either 1 or -1, and L and R are integers such that L â‰¤ R. The current value of b1 + a1 * x is less than L. a1_div_gcd and a2_div_gcd remain unchanged, sign_a1 and sign_a2 remain unchanged, and L and R remain unchanged.***
