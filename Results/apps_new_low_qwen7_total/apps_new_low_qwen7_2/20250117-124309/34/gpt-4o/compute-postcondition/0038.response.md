Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts six parameters: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `L`, and `R`. These parameters are integers such that \(0 < a1, a2 \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), \(-2 \cdot 10^9 \leq b1, b2, L, R \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), and \(L \leq R\).

After performing several checks and calculations, the function returns either -1 or a count based on specific conditions:
- It first calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a1` and `a2` using `func_1(abs(a1), abs(-a2))`.
- If `C = b2 - b1` is not divisible by the GCD, the function immediately returns -1.
- Otherwise, it adjusts `x0` and `y0` based on the GCD and signs of `A` and `B`.
- It then iterates through possible values of `x0` and `y0`, updating them based on `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd`.
- For each iteration, it calculates `val` as `a1 * ((x0 - 3) + 9 * a2_div_gcd) + b1`.
- If `L \leq val \leq R`, it increments the count.
- The loop continues until `val` exceeds `R`.

Finally, the function returns the count, which is incremented for each valid `val` within the range `[L, R]`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function handles the case where `C` is not divisible by the GCD by returning -1, ensuring that the subsequent calculations do not proceed if the conditions are not met.
- The function ensures that `x0` and `y0` are correctly adjusted based on the signs of `A` and `B` to maintain the relationship between the variables.
- The loop continues until `val` exceeds `R`, ensuring that all possible valid values are considered within the given range.**

This summary covers all the actions performed by the function and includes the edge case where the function returns -1 if the initial conditions are not met.
