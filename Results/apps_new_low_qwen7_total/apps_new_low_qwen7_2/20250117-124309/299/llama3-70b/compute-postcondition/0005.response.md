Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, and \(k \leq n\). If \((n - 1) // k > n // k\), the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no specific output change, but the condition \((n - 1) // k \leq n // k\) holds true.**
