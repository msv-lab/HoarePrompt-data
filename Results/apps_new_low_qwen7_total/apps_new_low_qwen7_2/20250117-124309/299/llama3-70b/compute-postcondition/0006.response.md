The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\). The function does not return anything directly from the given information. However, based on the structure provided, we need to consider potential return cases.

Given the constraints, the function might return different values or perform some operations based on the relationship between `n` and `k`, but no specific return values are mentioned.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, both non-negative integers with the specified constraints, and perform some operations or return values based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\), and performs some operations or returns values based on these inputs.**
