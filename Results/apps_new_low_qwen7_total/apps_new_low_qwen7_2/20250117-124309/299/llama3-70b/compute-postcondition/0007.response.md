Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters \(n\) and \(k\), both non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\). It checks whether the inequality \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\) holds true. If the condition is met, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. There are no additional changes to the variables \(n\) and \(k\) after the function executes. The function handles the edge case where the values of \(n\) and \(k\) are within the specified range but does not handle cases where \(n\) or \(k\) are outside this range, which would result in an invalid input scenario.**

This summary includes the actual functionality of the code, the conditions under which it prints 'YES' or 'NO', and mentions the handling of edge cases and missing validation for input ranges.
