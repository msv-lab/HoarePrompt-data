The code simply prints 'NO', which does not affect the values of `n` or `k`. The condition \((n - 1) // k \leq n // k\) remains true since printing 'NO' does not change the values of `n` or `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, and \(k \leq n\), and \((n - 1) // k \leq n // k\)**
