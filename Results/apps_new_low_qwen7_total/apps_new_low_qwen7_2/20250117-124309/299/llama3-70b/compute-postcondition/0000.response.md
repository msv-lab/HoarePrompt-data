The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the input is not specified, the exact values of `n` and `k` cannot be determined, but we know they are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\).

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, and \(k \leq n\)**.
