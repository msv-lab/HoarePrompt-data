The code `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console but does not change the values of the variables `n` or `k`. The condition \((n - 1) // k > n // k\) being true remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, and \(k \leq n\); the condition \((n - 1) // k > n // k\) evaluates to True, and the output is 'YES' printed to the console.**
