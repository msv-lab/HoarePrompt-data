You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
It's one more school day now. Sasha doesn't like classes and is always bored at them. So, each day he invents some game and plays in it alone or with friends.

Today he invented one simple game to play with Lena, with whom he shares a desk. The rules are simple. Sasha draws n sticks in a row. After that the players take turns crossing out exactly k sticks from left or right in each turn. Sasha moves first, because he is the inventor of the game. If there are less than k sticks on the paper before some turn, the game ends. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena. Sasha wants to know the result of the game before playing, you are to help him.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k ≤ n) — the number of sticks drawn by Sasha and the number k — the number of sticks to be crossed out on each turn.


-----Output-----

If Sasha wins, print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper of lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
YES

Input
10 4

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Sasha crosses out 1 stick, and then there are no sticks. So Lena can't make a move, and Sasha wins.

In the second example Sasha crosses out 4 sticks, then Lena crosses out 4 sticks, and after that there are only 2 sticks left. Sasha can't make a move. The players make equal number of moves, so Sasha doesn't win.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters \(n\) and \(k\), both non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\). It checks whether the inequality \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\) holds true. If the condition is met, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. There are no additional changes to the variables \(n\) and \(k\) after the function executes. The function handles the edge case where the values of \(n\) and \(k\) are within the specified range but does not handle cases where \(n\) or \(k\) are outside this range, which would result in an invalid input scenario.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is exactly divisible by `k`. In such a scenario, both Sasha and Lena can make an equal number of moves, resulting in a tie. However, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' in this case, as it checks if `(n - 1) // k > n // k`, which is false when `n` is exactly divisible by `k`.

For example, consider the input:
```
8 2
```
In this case, Sasha can make 4 moves by crossing out 2 sticks each time, and Lena can also make 4 moves by crossing out 2 sticks each time. Therefore, Sasha and Lena make an equal number of moves, and Sasha should not win. However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES".

To fix this, the condition should be adjusted to check if Sasha can make more moves than Lena in all scenarios. The correct condition should be:
```python
if (n - 1) // k >= n // k:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

This ensures that Sasha wins if he can make strictly more moves than Lena, including the case where `n` is exactly divisible by `k`.
