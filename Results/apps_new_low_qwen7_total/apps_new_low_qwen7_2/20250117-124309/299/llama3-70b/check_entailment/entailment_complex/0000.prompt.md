Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
It's one more school day now. Sasha doesn't like classes and is always bored at them. So, each day he invents some game and plays in it alone or with friends.

Today he invented one simple game to play with Lena, with whom he shares a desk. The rules are simple. Sasha draws n sticks in a row. After that the players take turns crossing out exactly k sticks from left or right in each turn. Sasha moves first, because he is the inventor of the game. If there are less than k sticks on the paper before some turn, the game ends. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena. Sasha wants to know the result of the game before playing, you are to help him.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k ≤ n) — the number of sticks drawn by Sasha and the number k — the number of sticks to be crossed out on each turn.


-----Output-----

If Sasha wins, print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper of lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
YES

Input
10 4

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Sasha crosses out 1 stick, and then there are no sticks. So Lena can't make a move, and Sasha wins.

In the second example Sasha crosses out 4 sticks, then Lena crosses out 4 sticks, and after that there are only 2 sticks left. Sasha can't make a move. The players make equal number of moves, so Sasha doesn't win.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ n.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - 1) // k > n // k) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, and \(k \leq n\). If \((n - 1) // k > n // k\), the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no specific output change, but the condition \((n - 1) // k \leq n // k\) holds true.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters \(n\) and \(k\), both non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\). It checks whether the inequality \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\) holds true. If the condition is met, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. There are no additional changes to the variables \(n\) and \(k\) after the function executes. The function handles the edge case where the values of \(n\) and \(k\) are within the specified range but does not handle cases where \(n\) or \(k\) are outside this range, which would result in an invalid input scenario.
