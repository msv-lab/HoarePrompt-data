### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game starts with \( n \) sticks.
   - Each player takes turns removing exactly \( k \) sticks either from the left or the right.
   - Sasha (player 1) goes first.
   - The game ends when fewer than \( k \) sticks remain before a player's turn.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

2. **Determining Moves:**
   - To determine who wins, we need to see how many full rounds of moves both players can make.
   - Sasha makes a move first, so if the total number of sticks \( n \) is such that Sasha can make an odd number of full rounds of moves, he will win because he will have one extra move.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Let's calculate the number of full rounds Sasha and Lena can each make.
   - Sasha makes a move first, then they alternate.
   - The number of full rounds is given by \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \).
   - Sasha makes one more move than Lena if \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \) is odd.

4. **Checking the Condition:**
   - We need to check if \( \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \right) \) is even or odd.
   - If \( \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \right) \) is odd, Sasha wins; otherwise, he does not.

5. **Given Solution Analysis:**
   - The provided solution checks if \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \).
   - This condition is equivalent to checking if \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \) is odd.
   - The logic is correct because:
     - \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \) is odd if and only if \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \) is even.
     - This means Sasha can make one more move than Lena.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha wins the game.

### Correctness:
**True**
