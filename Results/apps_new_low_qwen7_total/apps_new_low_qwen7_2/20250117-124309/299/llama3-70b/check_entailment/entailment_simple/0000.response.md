Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Sasha can make more moves than Lena given the rules of the game.
2. Sasha moves first and each player can remove exactly `k` sticks per turn.
3. The key observation here is that Sasha wins if he can make strictly more moves than Lena.
4. The total number of moves is determined by how many times `k` can fit into `n` (i.e., `n // k`). If Sasha can make one more move than Lena, the condition \((n - 1) // k > n // k\) must hold true.
5. Let's analyze the condition:
   - \(n // k\) gives the number of full moves both Sasha and Lena can make.
   - \((n - 1) // k\) considers the scenario where Sasha makes the first move, reducing the total by 1 stick before counting full moves.
6. If Sasha can make one more move, \((n - 1) // k\) will be exactly 1 more than \(n // k\) when \(n % k \neq 0\). However, if \(n % k = 0\), both expressions will be equal, meaning Sasha and Lena will make the same number of moves.

Given this analysis, the provided condition \((n - 1) // k > n // k\) correctly identifies the winning condition for Sasha. Therefore, the annotated program logic is correct.

Correctness: **True**
