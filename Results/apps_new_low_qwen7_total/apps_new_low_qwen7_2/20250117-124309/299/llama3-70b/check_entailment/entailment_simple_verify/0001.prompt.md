You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
It's one more school day now. Sasha doesn't like classes and is always bored at them. So, each day he invents some game and plays in it alone or with friends.

Today he invented one simple game to play with Lena, with whom he shares a desk. The rules are simple. Sasha draws n sticks in a row. After that the players take turns crossing out exactly k sticks from left or right in each turn. Sasha moves first, because he is the inventor of the game. If there are less than k sticks on the paper before some turn, the game ends. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena. Sasha wants to know the result of the game before playing, you are to help him.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k ≤ n) — the number of sticks drawn by Sasha and the number k — the number of sticks to be crossed out on each turn.


-----Output-----

If Sasha wins, print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper of lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
YES

Input
10 4

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Sasha crosses out 1 stick, and then there are no sticks. So Lena can't make a move, and Sasha wins.

In the second example Sasha crosses out 4 sticks, then Lena crosses out 4 sticks, and after that there are only 2 sticks left. Sasha can't make a move. The players make equal number of moves, so Sasha doesn't win.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ n.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - 1) // k > n // k) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, and \(k \leq n\). If \((n - 1) // k > n // k\), the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no specific output change, but the condition \((n - 1) // k \leq n // k\) holds true.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game starts with \( n \) sticks.
   - Each player takes turns removing exactly \( k \) sticks either from the left or the right.
   - Sasha (player 1) goes first.
   - The game ends when fewer than \( k \) sticks remain before a player's turn.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

2. **Determining Moves:**
   - To determine who wins, we need to see how many full rounds of moves both players can make.
   - Sasha makes a move first, so if the total number of sticks \( n \) is such that Sasha can make an odd number of full rounds of moves, he will win because he will have one extra move.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Let's calculate the number of full rounds Sasha and Lena can each make.
   - Sasha makes a move first, then they alternate.
   - The number of full rounds is given by \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \).
   - Sasha makes one more move than Lena if \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \) is odd.

4. **Checking the Condition:**
   - We need to check if \( \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \right) \) is even or odd.
   - If \( \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \right) \) is odd, Sasha wins; otherwise, he does not.

5. **Given Solution Analysis:**
   - The provided solution checks if \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \).
   - This condition is equivalent to checking if \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \) is odd.
   - The logic is correct because:
     - \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \) is odd if and only if \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \) is even.
     - This means Sasha can make one more move than Lena.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha wins the game.

### Correctness:
**True**
