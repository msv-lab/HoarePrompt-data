Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine the correctness of the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis

- **Objective**: Determine if Sasha can make more moves than Lena.
- **Rules**:
  - Sasha goes first.
  - Each player takes turns removing exactly `k` sticks either from the left or the right.
  - If fewer than `k` sticks remain before a player's turn, the game ends.
  - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

### Given Code Analysis

The code provided is:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

#### Annotation Explanation

- The annotation states that the condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` should be checked.
- This condition checks if the number of moves Sasha can make (`(n - 1) // k`) is greater than the number of moves Lena can make (`n // k`).

### Original Assessment

The original assessment correctly identifies that the condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is not sufficient to determine if Sasha can make strictly more moves than Lena in all cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where `n` is exactly divisible by `k`.

### Corrected Condition

To ensure Sasha can make more moves than Lena in all scenarios, we need to adjust the condition to:
```python
if (n - 1) // k >= n // k:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Validation Using Examples

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Correct Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: Sasha removes 1 stick and the game ends. No moves for Lena. Sasha wins.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `10 4`
   - Correct Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: Sasha removes 4 sticks, leaving 6. Lena removes 4 sticks, leaving 2. Sasha cannot make another move. Equal number of moves.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `8 2`
   - Correct Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: Sasha removes 2 sticks four times, and Lena removes 2 sticks four times. Both make 4 moves. Equal number of moves.

By using the corrected condition `(n - 1) // k >= n // k`, the program correctly handles all edge cases, including when `n` is exactly divisible by `k`.

### Conclusion

The original assessment was accurate. The program needs to be fixed by changing the condition to `if (n - 1) // k >= n // k:` to ensure Sasha can make strictly more moves than Lena in all scenarios.

Final: **False**
