### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to verify its correctness.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Sasha and Lena play a game with \( n \) sticks.
   - Each player removes exactly \( k \) sticks in their turn.
   - Sasha moves first.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

2. **Game Dynamics:**
   - After each move, the number of remaining sticks decreases.
   - Sasha makes a move first, so he will always make the first move.
   - The game ends when fewer than \( k \) sticks remain.

3. **Key Observation:**
   - The number of full rounds of moves both players can make depends on how many times \( k \) can be subtracted from \( n \).
   - Sasha wins if he makes one more move than Lena, which means he needs to make an odd number of full moves.

4. **Calculation:**
   - The number of full rounds of moves Sasha and Lena can make is given by \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \).
   - Since Sasha makes the first move, he will make one more move if \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \) is odd.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - To determine if Sasha wins, we need to check if \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor \) is greater than \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \).
   - If \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \), it implies that \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \) is even, meaning Sasha will make an odd number of full moves and thus win.

6. **Provided Solution Analysis:**
   - The code checks if \( \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \).
   - This condition is correct because it ensures that \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \) is even, implying Sasha will make an odd number of full moves.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the given constraints \( 1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18} \) and \( k \leq n \).
   - The logic works for all valid inputs as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha wins the game. The reasoning aligns with the problem requirements, and the code accurately checks the necessary condition.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
