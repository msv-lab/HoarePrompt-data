### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program. The goal is to determine if Sasha wins the game, which requires him to make more moves than Lena. 

#### Key Points:
1. **Turn Logic**: Each player takes turns removing exactly \( k \) sticks from either the left or the right.
2. **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.
3. **Current Implementation**: The program checks if \((n - 1) // k > n // k\). This logic is flawed because it only considers the scenario where Sasha makes one more move than Lena, but it does not account for the case where both make the same number of moves.

#### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial State**: Sasha starts with \( n \) sticks.
- **Move Calculation**:
  - If \( n \) is exactly divisible by \( k \), both Sasha and Lena will make an equal number of moves, and Sasha will not win.
  - If \( n \) is not exactly divisible by \( k \), we need to check how many full moves each can make.

#### Correct Logic:
The correct approach is to compare the number of full moves each player can make. Sasha makes the first move, so he gets an extra turn if the total number of moves is odd.

Given \( n \) and \( k \):
- Sasha's moves = \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor + 1\)
- Lena's moves = \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{k} \right\rfloor\)

Sasha wins if his moves are strictly greater than Lena's moves:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor + 1 > \left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{k} \right\rfloor \]

However, this can be simplified by recognizing that:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{k} \right\rfloor + 1 \text{ if } n \mod k = 0 \]
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor + 1 > \left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{k} \right\rfloor \text{ if } n \mod k \neq 0 \]

Thus, the correct condition should be:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{k} \right\rfloor < \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \]

The given program already checks this condition correctly. The original assessment incorrectly identified the issue, as the current implementation indeed checks if Sasha can make more moves than Lena, including the case where \( n \) is exactly divisible by \( k \).

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate. The given program correctly determines if Sasha can make more moves than Lena, including the edge case where \( n \) is exactly divisible by \( k \).

Final: **True**
