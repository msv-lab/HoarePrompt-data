Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the rules given. The program calculates the number of moves each player can make:

1. Sasha moves first.
2. Each player takes turns removing exactly \(k\) sticks.
3. The game ends when fewer than \(k\) sticks remain.
4. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

The key check in the program is whether \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\):

- \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\) gives the number of full turns Sasha can make.
- \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor\) gives the number of full turns Lena can make.

Since Sasha moves first, if Sasha can make one more move than Lena, he will have made strictly more moves overall. This check accurately reflects the condition for Sasha to win.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines the outcome of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
