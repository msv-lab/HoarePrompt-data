Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is exactly divisible by `k`. In such a scenario, both Sasha and Lena can make an equal number of moves, resulting in a tie. However, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' in this case, as it checks if `(n - 1) // k > n // k`, which is false when `n` is exactly divisible by `k`.

For example, consider the input:
```
8 2
```
In this case, Sasha can make 4 moves by crossing out 2 sticks each time, and Lena can also make 4 moves by crossing out 2 sticks each time. Therefore, Sasha and Lena make an equal number of moves, and Sasha should not win. However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES".

To fix this, the condition should be adjusted to check if Sasha can make more moves than Lena in all scenarios. The correct condition should be:
```python
if (n - 1) // k >= n // k:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

This ensures that Sasha wins if he can make strictly more moves than Lena, including the case where `n` is exactly divisible by `k`.
