Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both `n` and `m` are equal to 1 correctly. According to the problem description, the grid is from `(0, 0)` to `(n, m)` inclusive. For the input `(1, 1)`, the grid contains only one point `(1, 1)`, but the program tries to choose 4 different points, which is impossible. The provided solution returns the points `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`, which are out of bounds for the grid `(1, 1)`. Therefore, the program fails to handle this edge case, making it incorrect.
