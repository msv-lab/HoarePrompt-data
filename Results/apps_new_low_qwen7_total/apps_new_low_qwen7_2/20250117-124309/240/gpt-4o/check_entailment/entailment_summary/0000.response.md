Reasoning:
1. The problem requires choosing 4 points to form the longest possible polyline.
2. The function `func_1` attempts to generate 4 points based on the dimensions `n` and `m`.
3. For cases where both `n` and `m` are at least 2, the function correctly chooses the four corners of the rectangle, ensuring the maximum distance between any two points.
4. For edge cases where `n` or `m` is less than 2, the function selects points that still ensure the maximum possible distances between them.

Let's verify each case:

- When `n >= 2` and `m >= 2`, the points chosen are the corners of the rectangle, which indeed form the longest possible polyline.
- When `n = 0`, the points `(0, 0)`, `(0, m)`, `(0, 1)`, and `(0, m - 1)` are chosen, forming a vertical line segment of maximum length.
- When `m = 0`, the points `(0, 0)`, `(n, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(n - 1, 0)` are chosen, forming a horizontal line segment of maximum length.
- When `n = 1`, the points `(0, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(1, m)`, and `(0, m)` are chosen, forming a vertical line segment of maximum length.

In all these cases, the function correctly generates the points that maximize the length of the polyline. Therefore, the program logic is sound and adheres to the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
