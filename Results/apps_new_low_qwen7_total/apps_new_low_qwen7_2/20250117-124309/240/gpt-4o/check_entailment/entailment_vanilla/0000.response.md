### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - If both `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 2, it returns the points \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), \((0, m)\), which form a rectangle with the maximum possible diagonal.
   - If `n` is 0, it returns points to cover the vertical side from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, m)\).
   - If `m` is 0, it returns points to cover the horizontal side from \((0, 0)\) to \((n, 0)\).
   - If `n` is 1, it forms a diagonal path from \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 0)\) and \((1, m)\) to \((0, m)\).
   - If `m` is 1, it forms a diagonal path from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 1)\) and \((n, 0)\) to \((n, 1)\).

3. **Output Printing**:
   - The main part of the program prints the points returned by `func_1` in order.

4. **Coverage**:
   - For all given conditions (both dimensions â‰¥ 2, one dimension is 0, and single dimension cases), the function `func_1` provides a valid set of points that can form the longest possible polyline.

Given these points:
- For \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 2 \): The points form the maximum diagonal.
- For smaller values of \( n \) or \( m \): The points form the longest path along the edges.

Thus, the program handles all edge cases and returns the correct points for forming the longest polyline.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
