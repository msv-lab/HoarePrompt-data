Reasoning:

1. The problem requires choosing 4 points to form a polyline with the maximum possible length.
2. The polyline's length is determined by the distances between consecutive points.
3. For any given rectangle, the maximum possible length of the polyline can be achieved by selecting the four corners of the rectangle. This is because the distance between opposite corners (diagonals) is the longest possible segment within the rectangle.

Let's examine the code:

- The function `func_1(n, m)` correctly identifies the conditions for the values of `n` and `m` and returns the points corresponding to the four corners of the rectangle.
- If both `n` and `m` are at least 2, it returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`.
- If `n` is 0, it returns `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`, which covers the case where the rectangle degenerates into a vertical line.
- If `m` is 0, it returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`, which covers the case where the rectangle degenerates into a horizontal line.
- If `n` is 1, it returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`, which covers the case where the rectangle is a vertical strip.
- In all other cases, it returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.

Given these conditions, the function will always return the four corner points of the grid, ensuring the maximum possible polyline length.

Therefore, the function correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
