### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Case 1: Both \( n \) and \( m \) are at least 2**:
     - The function returns \([(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]\). These points form a rectangle with the maximum possible diagonal, ensuring the longest polyline.
   - **Case 2: \( n = 0 \)**:
     - The function returns \([(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]\). This covers the vertical side from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, m)\).
   - **Case 3: \( m = 0 \)**:
     - The function returns \([(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]\). This covers the horizontal side from \((0, 0)\) to \((n, 0)\).
   - **Case 4: \( n = 1 \)**:
     - The function returns \([(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]\). This forms a diagonal path from \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 0)\) and \((1, m)\) to \((0, m)\).

3. **Output Printing**:
   - The main part of the program prints the points returned by `func_1` in order.

4. **Coverage**:
   - The function `func_1` provides a valid set of points for forming the longest possible polyline in all given conditions.
   - However, there is one important consideration: the function assumes that the points are distinct and form a valid polyline. We need to ensure that the points are indeed distinct and the output is correct.

5. **Distinct Points**:
   - In all cases, the points returned by `func_1` are distinct. Let's verify:
     - For \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 2 \): The points are \([(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]\), which are clearly distinct.
     - For \( n = 0 \): The points are \([(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]\), which are also distinct.
     - For \( m = 0 \): The points are \([(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]\), which are distinct.
     - For \( n = 1 \): The points are \([(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]\), which are distinct.

6. **Longest Polyline**:
   - The function ensures that the points returned form the longest possible polyline by covering the maximum distance along the edges of the grid.

Given these considerations, the program correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the points are distinct and form the longest possible polyline.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all given conditions and ensures that the points form the longest possible polyline.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
