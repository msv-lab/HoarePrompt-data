Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given code. The goal is to find four points on a grid such that they form the longest possible polyline. The function `func_1` handles different cases based on the values of `n` and `m`.

### Case Analysis

1. **Both `n` and `m` are at least 2**:
   - The function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`.
   - These points form a rectangle with the maximum possible length when `n` and `m` are both at least 2.

2. **`n` is 0**:
   - The function returns `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`.
   - This forms a vertical line segment.

3. **`m` is 0**:
   - The function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`.
   - This forms a horizontal line segment.

4. **`n` is 1**:
   - The function returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`.
   - This forms a rectangle but with a width of 1.

5. **`m` is 1**:
   - This case is not explicitly handled in the provided function. However, we can infer that the function will handle it similarly to the case where `n` is 1.

6. **Both `n` and `m` are 1**:
   - This is an edge case. The grid is a single point `(1, 1)`, and the function tries to return `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]`, which is out of bounds for the grid `(1, 1)`.
   - The provided function does not handle this case correctly because it tries to use indices out of the grid's range.

### Correctness Analysis

- The function handles most cases correctly, ensuring that the points returned are within the grid boundaries.
- However, the function fails to handle the case where both `n` and `m` are 1, as it returns points that are out of bounds.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where both `n` and `m` are 1 correctly, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
