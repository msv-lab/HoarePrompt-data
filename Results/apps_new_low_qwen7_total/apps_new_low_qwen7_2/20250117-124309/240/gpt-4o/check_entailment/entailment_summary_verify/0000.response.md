### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem, the program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description:
- The task is to choose 4 different points from a grid of lattice points from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive to form the longest possible polyline.
- The polyline's length is the sum of the lengths of the individual line segments formed by these points.
- The program must handle various cases for the dimensions of the grid (n, m).

#### Given Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` returns a list of 4 points based on the values of `n` and `m`.
- The function handles different cases to ensure there are exactly 4 distinct points within the grid boundaries.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` handles several cases to generate 4 points within the grid.
   - **Case 1**: Both `n` and `m` are at least 2.
     - The function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`, which are valid points within the grid.
   - **Case 2**: `n` is 0.
     - The function returns `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`, ensuring the points are within the grid.
   - **Case 3**: `m` is 0.
     - The function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`, ensuring the points are within the grid.
   - **Case 4**: `n` is 1.
     - The function returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`, ensuring the points are within the grid.
   - **Case 5**: `m` is 1.
     - The function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`, ensuring the points are within the grid.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - For the input `(1, 1)`, the function returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]`, which are valid points within the grid.
   - For the input `(0, 0)`, the function returns `[(0, 0)]`, which is not possible since we need 4 points, but the input guarantees at least 4 points.

#### Conclusion:
- The function `func_1` correctly handles all cases to ensure there are 4 distinct points within the grid boundaries.
- The program reads the input and calls `func_1` to get the points, then prints them out.
- The original assessment stated that the program does not handle the case where both `n` and `m` are 1 correctly. However, the function summary and the implementation show that the function handles this case appropriately by returning valid points.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the provided function summary and the analysis of the code.
