### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to return specific sets of points based on the values of `n` and `m`. However, there is a missing case for when `m` is 1 but `n` is not 1. This means the function does not handle all possible combinations of `n` and `m`.

   - For \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 2 \):
     - The function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`, which indeed forms the longest possible polyline.

   - For `n == 0`:
     - The function returns `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`, which covers the vertical side.

   - For `m == 0`:
     - The function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`, which covers the horizontal side.

   - For `n == 1`:
     - The function returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`, which forms a diagonal path.

   - For `m == 1` but `n != 1`:
     - The function does not handle this case, leading to a potential oversight. Specifically, if `n > 1` and `m == 1`, the function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`, which does not cover the full range of the grid horizontally.

3. **Output Printing**:
   - The main part of the program correctly prints the points returned by `func_1` in order.

4. **Coverage**:
   - While the function `func_1` handles most cases, it fails to handle the case where `m == 1` and `n > 1`. In this scenario, the points provided do not form the longest possible polyline because they only cover one unit horizontally, whereas the longest polyline would extend across the entire width of the grid.

Given these points, the function `func_1` does not cover all possible scenarios, particularly when `m == 1` and `n > 1`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program is correct because it missed a critical edge case. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
