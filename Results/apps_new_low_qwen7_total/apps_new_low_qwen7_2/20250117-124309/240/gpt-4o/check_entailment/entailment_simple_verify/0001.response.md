### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is accurate and correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - If both `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 2, it returns the points \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), \((0, m)\), which form a rectangle with the maximum possible diagonal. This is correct.
   - If `n` is 0, it returns points to cover the vertical side from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, m)\). This is correct.
   - If `m` is 0, it returns points to cover the horizontal side from \((0, 0)\) to \((n, 0)\). This is correct.
   - If `n` is 1, it forms a diagonal path from \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 0)\) and \((1, m)\) to \((0, m)\). This is correct.
   - If `m` is 1, it forms a diagonal path from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 1)\) and \((n, 0)\) to \((n, 1)\). This is correct.

3. **Output Printing**:
   - The main part of the program prints the points returned by `func_1` in order. This is correct.

4. **Coverage**:
   - For all given conditions (both dimensions â‰¥ 2, one dimension is 0, and single dimension cases), the function `func_1` provides a valid set of points that can form the longest possible polyline. This is correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when `n` or `m` is 0, or 1. The points returned form the longest possible polyline for each case.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code clearly shows that the function `func_1` handles all cases as described in the original assessment.
- Each condition in the if-else block ensures that the correct points are chosen to maximize the length of the polyline.
- The output is printed in the correct order, as described.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and the correctness of the solution. Therefore, we can maintain the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
