You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a rectangular grid of lattice points from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. You have to choose exactly 4 different points to build a polyline possibly with self-intersections and self-touching. This polyline should be as long as possible.

A polyline defined by points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 consists of the line segments p_1 p_2, p_2 p_3, p_3 p_4, and its length is the sum of the lengths of the individual line segments.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that grid contains at least 4 different points.


-----Output-----

Print 4 lines with two integers per line separated by space — coordinates of points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 in order which represent the longest possible polyline.

Judge program compares your answer and jury's answer with 10^{ - 6} precision.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - If both `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 2, it returns the points \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), \((0, m)\), which form a rectangle with the maximum possible diagonal.
   - If `n` is 0, it returns points to cover the vertical side from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, m)\).
   - If `m` is 0, it returns points to cover the horizontal side from \((0, 0)\) to \((n, 0)\).
   - If `n` is 1, it forms a diagonal path from \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 0)\) and \((1, m)\) to \((0, m)\).
   - If `m` is 1, it forms a diagonal path from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 1)\) and \((n, 0)\) to \((n, 1)\).

3. **Output Printing**:
   - The main part of the program prints the points returned by `func_1` in order.

4. **Coverage**:
   - For all given conditions (both dimensions ≥ 2, one dimension is 0, and single dimension cases), the function `func_1` provides a valid set of points that can form the longest possible polyline.

Given these points:
- For \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 2 \): The points form the maximum diagonal.
- For smaller values of \( n \) or \( m \): The points form the longest path along the edges.

Thus, the program handles all edge cases and returns the correct points for forming the longest polyline.
