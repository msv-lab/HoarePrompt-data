### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem statement and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Statement:**
   - We need to choose 4 different points from a grid of size \( (n, m) \) to form the longest possible polyline.
   - The polyline should be as long as possible, and the input guarantees that there are at least 4 different points on the grid.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code handles several cases for different values of \( n \) and \( m \).
   - For \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 2 \), the code correctly returns the points \([(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]\), which indeed form the longest possible polyline.
   - For other cases:
     - If \( n = 0 \), it returns \([(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]\).
     - If \( m = 0 \), it returns \([(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]\).
     - If \( n = 1 \), it returns \([(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]\).
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it returns \([(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]\).

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where both \( n \) and \( m \) are equal to 1 correctly.
   - However, the problem statement specifies that the grid is from \((0, 0)\) to \((n, m)\) inclusive, meaning for \( (1, 1) \), the grid contains exactly the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((1, 1)\). These are 4 different points.
   - The code returns \([(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]\), which is a valid set of 4 points and forms a valid polyline.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles all cases, including the edge case \( (1, 1) \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct because it handles all specified cases and edge cases as required by the problem statement.
