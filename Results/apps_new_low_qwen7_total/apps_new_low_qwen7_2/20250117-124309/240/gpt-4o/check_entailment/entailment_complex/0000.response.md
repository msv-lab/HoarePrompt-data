### Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to return a set of four points that form a polyline with the maximum possible length given the dimensions of the grid. The function handles different cases based on the values of `n` and `m`:

1. **Both `n` and `m` are at least 2**: The function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`. These points form a rectangle that maximizes the length of the polyline.
2. **`n` is 0**: The function returns `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`. This forms a vertical line segment and a small horizontal segment, which still ensures a polyline of significant length.
3. **`m` is 0**: The function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`. This forms a horizontal line segment and a small vertical segment.
4. **`n` is 1**: The function returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`. This forms a vertical line segment and a large horizontal segment.

In each case, the function ensures that the points are distinct and form a polyline of maximum possible length given the constraints.

Given that the function correctly handles all possible edge cases and ensures that the output is a valid set of 4 points forming a polyline of maximum length, the implementation appears to be correct.
