Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a rectangular grid of lattice points from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. You have to choose exactly 4 different points to build a polyline possibly with self-intersections and self-touching. This polyline should be as long as possible.

A polyline defined by points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 consists of the line segments p_1 p_2, p_2 p_3, p_3 p_4, and its length is the sum of the lengths of the individual line segments.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that grid contains at least 4 different points.


-----Output-----

Print 4 lines with two integers per line separated by space — coordinates of points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 in order which represent the longest possible polyline.

Judge program compares your answer and jury's answer with 10^{ - 6} precision.

There exist at least 4 different points on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. If `n` is 1, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`. Otherwise, `points` is a list containing the elements [(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)].

If `m` is 0, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`. Otherwise, if `n` is 1, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`. If neither of these conditions is met, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.

If `m` is 0, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`. If `n` is 1, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`. Otherwise, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.

There exist at least 4 different points on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. If both `n` and `m` are at least 2, `points` is a list containing the elements [(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]. Otherwise, if `n` is 0, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`. If `m` is 0, `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`. If `n` is 1, `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`.
    return points
    #`points` is a list containing the elements based on the conditions: if both n and m are at least 2, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`. If n is 0, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`. If m is 0, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`. If n is 1, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1000\). Based on the values of `n` and `m`, it returns a list of points that satisfy the condition of having at least 4 different points on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. Specifically:
- If both `n` and `m` are at least 2, the function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`.
- If `n` is 0, the function returns `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`.
- If `m` is 0, the function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`.
- If `n` is 1, the function returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`.

The function ensures that the returned list always contains exactly 4 distinct points on the grid, adhering to the given constraints.
