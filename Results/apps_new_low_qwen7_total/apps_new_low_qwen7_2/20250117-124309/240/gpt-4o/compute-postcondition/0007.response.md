The code creates a list named `points` and assigns it the values `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `m`. After executing this code, the value of `m` remains 0, and `n` retains its initial value. The precondition that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), `n \geq 2` or `m \geq 2`, and the current value of `m` is 0 is still valid.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), `n \geq 2` or `m \geq 2\), `m` is 0; `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`**
