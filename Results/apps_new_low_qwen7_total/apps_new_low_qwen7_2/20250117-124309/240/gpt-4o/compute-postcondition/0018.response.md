The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1000 and there exist at least 4 different points on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive.

Based on the conditions:
- If both `n` and `m` are at least 2, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`.
- If `n` is 0, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`.
- If `m` is 0, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`.
- If `n` is 1, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `n` and `m`, and based on the given conditions, it returns a list of points that satisfy the specified criteria.
