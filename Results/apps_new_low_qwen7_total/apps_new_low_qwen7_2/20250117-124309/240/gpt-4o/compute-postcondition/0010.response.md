The code creates a list of tuples named `points` containing the coordinates \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), and \((0, m)\). The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list of points and the unchanged values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 1000, there exist at least 4 different points on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive, and m is not equal to 0; `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`**
