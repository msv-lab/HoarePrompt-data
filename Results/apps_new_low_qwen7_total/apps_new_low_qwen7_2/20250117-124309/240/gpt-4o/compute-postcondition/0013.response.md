Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1000, and m != 0. There exist at least 4 different points on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. If `n` is 1, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`. Otherwise, `points` is a list containing the elements [(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)].**
