Output State: **`points` is a list containing the elements based on the conditions: if both n and m are at least 2, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`. If n is 0, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`. If m is 0, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`. If n is 1, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`**.
