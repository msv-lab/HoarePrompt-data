The code creates a list `points` and assigns it the values `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`. This means that the variable `points` now holds this list of tuples. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 1000; `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`**
