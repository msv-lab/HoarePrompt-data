Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1000\). There exist at least 4 different points on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. If `n` is 0, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`. If `m` is 0, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`. If `n` is 1, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`. Otherwise, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.***
