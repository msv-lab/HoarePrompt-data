The code initializes a list of tuples called `points` with four specific points: `(0, 0)`, `(n, 0)`, `(n, m)`, and `(0, m)`. This does not affect the values of `n` and `m` directly but updates the `points` list. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 1000 and `n` >= 2; `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `m` <= 1000 and `m` >= 2; `points` is a list containing the elements [(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]**
