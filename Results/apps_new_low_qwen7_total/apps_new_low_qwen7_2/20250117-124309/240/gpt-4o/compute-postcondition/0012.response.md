The code initializes a list `points` with four tuples: `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(n, 1)`, and `(n, 0)`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `m` themselves, but it sets up these points on the grid. The conditions given in the initial state (0 <= n, m <= 1000, m != 0, n != 1, and there are at least 4 different points) are preserved.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 1000 and n != 1; `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 1000 and m != 0; `points` is a list containing the elements [(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]**
