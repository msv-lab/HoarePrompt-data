Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `tiles` which contains exactly three space-separated strings representing suited tiles. Each string consists of a digit from 1 to 9 followed by a lowercase letter `m`, `p`, or `s`, indicating the suit. The function checks if the given three tiles form a koutsu or shuntsu (consecutive sequence or triplet of the same number). If they do, it returns 0. Otherwise, it processes the tiles to determine the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a group of three consecutive tiles or a triplet for each suit (`m`, `p`, `s`). The function returns this minimum number.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
1. **If the input string `tiles` does not contain exactly three space-separated strings:** The function does not handle this case. It will raise a `ValueError` when calling `split()`.
2. **If the input string `tiles` contains invalid tile formats (e.g., incorrect digits or letters):** The function does not validate the tile format. It assumes the input is correct and will crash if invalid tiles are provided.
3. **If the input tiles already form a valid koutsu or shuntsu for all suits:** The function will incorrectly return 0 even though additional tiles might still be needed for other suits.
4. **If the input tiles do not form a valid koutsu or shuntsu for any suit:** The function correctly calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a group for each suit.

After the function executes, the final state of the program is:
- The function returns either 0 or the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a group for each suit, depending on the input tiles.
