Functionality: **The function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` accepts a list `tiles` containing three strings representing suited tiles. Each string consists of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') representing the suit. The function sorts the list and then checks the length of the list to determine the number of additional tiles needed to complete a group.

- If the length of `tiles` is 1, the function returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.
- If the length of `tiles` is 2, the function further checks if the two tiles are identical. If they are, it returns 1, indicating that 1 more tile is needed. If the two tiles are not identical, it checks if the difference between the two tiles is less than or equal to 2. If true, it returns 1, indicating that 1 more tile is needed. Otherwise, it returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.
- If the length of `tiles` is 3, the function returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.

This covers all potential cases: the list can have 1, 2, or 3 elements, and the function will always return either 1 or 2 based on the conditions described. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.**
