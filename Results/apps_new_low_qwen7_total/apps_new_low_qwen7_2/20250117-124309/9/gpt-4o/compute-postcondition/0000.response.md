The `sort()` method sorts the `tiles` list in ascending order. Since the list contains strings consisting of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's'), the sorting will first compare the digits and then the letters. The letters 'm', 'p', and 's' are sorted alphabetically.

Given that the list initially contains exactly three unique or duplicate strings, let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. If the list contains three unique strings, they will be sorted based on their digits and then letters.
2. If there are duplicates, the duplicates will remain adjacent after sorting.

Let's denote the initial list as `['a', 'b', 'c']` where `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings representing tiles. After sorting, the list will be in ascending order.

Since the exact initial values are not specified, we can use generic placeholders and then provide a general output state.

For example, if the initial list was `['3m', '5p', '7s']`, after sorting, it would become `['3m', '5p', '7s']`.

Another example, if the initial list was `['3m', '3p', '3s']`, after sorting, it would remain `['3m', '3p', '3s']` because they are duplicates and already in order.

To provide a specific output, let's assume an initial list `['5m', '3p', '7s']`. After sorting, it would become `['3p', '5m', '7s']`.

Output State: **`tiles` is ['3p', '5m', '7s']**
