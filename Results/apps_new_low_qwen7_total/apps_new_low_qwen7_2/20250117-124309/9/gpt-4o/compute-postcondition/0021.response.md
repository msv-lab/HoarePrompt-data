The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tiles`. `tiles` is a string containing exactly three space-separated strings representing suited tiles. Each string consists of a digit from 1 to 9 followed by a lowercase letter m, p, or s, indicating the suit.

The function returns:
- Case_1: 0
- Case_2: `min_additional_tiles`, which is the minimum number of additional tiles needed

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `tiles` and return either 0 or the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a group.
