Reasoning:

1. **Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`**: This function correctly identifies whether three given tiles form a koutsu (triplet) or a shuntsu (sequence). It handles both conditions appropriately.
2. **Function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`**: This function correctly calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a group of three tiles. It handles all edge cases where the group has 1, 2, or 3 tiles and determines the necessary additional tiles accurately.
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function combines the results of `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` and `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`. It first checks if the three tiles already form a mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu). If not, it calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed to form a mentsu by considering each suit separately.

Given these observations, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the minimum number of extra suited tiles needed to ensure Tokitsukaze has at least one mentsu in her hand.

Correctness: **True**
