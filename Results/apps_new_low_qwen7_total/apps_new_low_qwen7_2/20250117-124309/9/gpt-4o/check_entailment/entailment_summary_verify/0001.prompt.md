You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\ldots$, 9s.

In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.

Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?

Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. 

Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. 

Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$ and the second character is m, p or s.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.


-----Examples-----
Input
1s 2s 3s

Output
0

Input
9m 9m 9m

Output
0

Input
3p 9m 2p

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.

In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.

In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` accepts a list `tiles` containing three strings representing suited tiles. Each string consists of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') representing the suit. The function sorts the list and then checks the length of the list to determine the number of additional tiles needed to complete a group.

- If the length of `tiles` is 1, the function returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.
- If the length of `tiles` is 2, the function further checks if the two tiles are identical. If they are, it returns 1, indicating that 1 more tile is needed. If the two tiles are not identical, it checks if the difference between the two tiles is less than or equal to 2. If true, it returns 1, indicating that 1 more tile is needed. Otherwise, it returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.
- If the length of `tiles` is 3, the function returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.

This covers all potential cases: the list can have 1, 2, or 3 elements, and the function will always return either 1 or 2 based on the conditions described. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's break down the problem and the provided functions.

1. **Function `func_1(tiles)`**:
   - This function splits the input into three tiles.
   - It checks if the tiles form a koutsu or shuntsu using the helper function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`.
   - If they do, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it categorizes the tiles by their suit and calculates the minimum additional tiles needed to complete a koutsu or shuntsu for each suit using `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`.

2. **Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3)`**:
   - This function checks if the three tiles form a koutsu or shuntsu.
   - It handles the case where all three tiles are identical (koutsu).
   - It also handles the case where the three tiles are consecutive in the same suit (shuntsu).

3. **Function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(tiles)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a group of tiles.
   - If there is only one tile, it needs two more tiles.
   - If there are two tiles, it checks if they are the same or if they are consecutive. If not, it needs one more tile.
   - If there are three tiles, it always returns 2, which seems incorrect because a group of three is already a koutsu.

### Analysis:

- The logic in `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` is correct.
- The logic in `func_1` is mostly correct but has a flaw in `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` for groups of three tiles.
- `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` incorrectly returns 2 for groups of three tiles, which should be 0.

### Conclusion:

The function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` for groups of three tiles needs to be fixed. Specifically, it should return 0 when the input is a koutsu.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def tiles_needed_to_complete_group(tiles):
    tiles.sort()
    if len(tiles) == 1:
        return 2
    if len(tiles) == 2:
        if tiles[0] == tiles[1]:
            return 1
        if tiles[1] - tiles[0] <= 2:
            return 1
        return 2
    if len(tiles) == 3:
        return 0
```

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flaw in the `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` function for groups of three tiles.
