Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input consists of two identical tiles and one tile that forms a valid shuntsu with another tile drawn. Let's consider the following example:

- Input: `3p 9m 2p`

According to the problem description, Tokitsukaze needs to draw one additional tile to form a shuntsu. However, the current implementation of the `func_1` function returns `2` instead of `1`, because it incorrectly calculates the minimum additional tiles needed as follows:

1. It checks if there is a koutsu or shuntsu among the three tiles, which is not the case here.
2. It then tries to complete groups for each suit:
   - For the 'p' suit: `[3, 2]`. To complete this group, it returns `2`.
   - For the 'm' and 's' suits: they are empty, so it returns `2` as well.

Since the function takes the minimum value between the calculated values for each suit, it returns `2` instead of `1`.

To fix this, the function should directly check if any two tiles can form part of a shuntsu and return `1` if so. This can be achieved by checking all possible pairs of tiles and seeing if they can be extended to form a valid shuntsu with an additional tile.
