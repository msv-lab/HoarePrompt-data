Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function takes a string of three space-separated suited tiles and checks if Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu or shuntsu. If she does, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed to form either a koutsu or a shuntsu. The function calls `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` and `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` to perform these checks.

2. **Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`**: This function correctly checks if the given three tiles form either a koutsu or a shuntsu. It returns `True` if the tiles are identical (koutsu) or if they are three consecutive numbers in the same suit (shuntsu).

3. **Function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`**: This function calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a group (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) based on the current tiles in the hand. The logic in this function is correct, covering all possible scenarios for the length of the input list.

Given the descriptions and the logical flow of the provided functions, the overall program logic appears to be correct. It checks for existing mentsu and calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed if none exist.

Correctness: **True**
