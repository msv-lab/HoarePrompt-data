### Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's break down the problem and the provided functions.

1. **Function `func_1(tiles)`**:
   - This function splits the input into three tiles.
   - It checks if the tiles form a koutsu or shuntsu using the helper function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`.
   - If they do, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it categorizes the tiles by their suit and calculates the minimum additional tiles needed to complete a koutsu or shuntsu for each suit using `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`.

2. **Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3)`**:
   - This function checks if the three tiles form a koutsu or shuntsu.
   - It handles the case where all three tiles are identical (koutsu).
   - It also handles the case where the three tiles are consecutive in the same suit (shuntsu).

3. **Function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(tiles)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a group of tiles.
   - If there is only one tile, it needs two more tiles.
   - If there are two tiles, it checks if they are the same or if they are consecutive. If not, it needs one more tile.
   - If there are three tiles, it always returns 2, which seems incorrect because a group of three is already a koutsu.

### Analysis:

- The logic in `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` is correct.
- The logic in `func_1` is mostly correct but has a flaw in `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` for groups of three tiles.
- `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` incorrectly returns 2 for groups of three tiles, which should be 0.

### Conclusion:

The function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` for groups of three tiles needs to be fixed. Specifically, it should return 0 when the input is a koutsu.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def tiles_needed_to_complete_group(tiles):
    tiles.sort()
    if len(tiles) == 1:
        return 2
    if len(tiles) == 2:
        if tiles[0] == tiles[1]:
            return 1
        if tiles[1] - tiles[0] <= 2:
            return 1
        return 2
    if len(tiles) == 3:
        return 0
```

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flaw in the `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` function for groups of three tiles.
