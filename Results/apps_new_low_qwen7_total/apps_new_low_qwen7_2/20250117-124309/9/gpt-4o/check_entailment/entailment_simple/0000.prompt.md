# Problem:
Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\ldots$, 9s.

In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.

Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?

Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. 

Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. 

Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$ and the second character is m, p or s.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.


-----Examples-----
Input
1s 2s 3s

Output
0

Input
9m 9m 9m

Output
0

Input
3p 9m 2p

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.

In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.

In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
tiles = input().strip()
print(func_1(tiles))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tiles is a string containing exactly three space-separated strings representing suited tiles. Each string consists of a digit from 1 to 9 followed by a lowercase letter m, p, or s, indicating the suit. The function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` and `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` are assumed to be defined elsewhere and work correctly.
def func_1(tiles):
    t1, t2, t3 = tiles.split()
    if is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `tiles` is a string containing exactly three space-separated strings representing suited tiles; `t1` is the first tile from `tiles`, `t2` is the second tile from `tiles`, `t3` is the third tile from `tiles`; `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` and `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` are defined and their values are unchanged. The condition `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3)` is false.
    suits = {'m': [], 'p': [], 's': []}
    for tile in [t1, t2, t3]:
        suits[tile[1]].append(int(tile[0]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `tiles` is a string containing exactly three space-separated strings representing suited tiles, `t1` is the first tile from `tiles`, `t2` is the second tile from `tiles`, `t3` is the third tile from `tiles`, `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` remains unchanged, `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` remains unchanged, `suits` is initialized with keys `'m'`, `'p'`, and `'s'` and their values are empty lists, except `suits['m'] = [5]`, `suits['p'] = [5]`, `suits['s'] = [3]`, `tile` is the third tile from `tiles`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over the tiles `t1`, `t2`, and `t3`.
    #   - For each tile, the code appends the numeric part of the tile (converted to an integer) to the corresponding suit list in the `suits` dictionary.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - The loop updates the `suits` dictionary but does not change the values of `tiles`, `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`, `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`, or `t1`, `t2`, `t3`.
    #   - The variable `tile` changes with each iteration, taking on the values `t1`, `t2`, and `t3` in order.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - After the first iteration, `suits['m']` or `suits['p']` or `suits['s']` gets populated with the integer value of the first tile.
    #   - After the second iteration, the second tile’s integer value is appended to one of the suit lists.
    #   - After the third iteration, the third tile’s integer value is appended to one of the suit lists.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The final state of the `suits` dictionary will contain the integer values of the three tiles in the respective suit lists.
    #   - Since the loop processes each tile exactly once, the final values in the `suits` dictionary will be:
    #     - `suits['m'] = [5]` if `t1` is a '5m', `suits['p'] = [5]` if `t1` is a '5p', or `suits['s'] = [3]` if `t1` is a '3s'.
    #   - After processing all three tiles, the `suits` dictionary will reflect the complete set of integers for each suit based on the tiles provided.
    #
    #Therefore, the final state of the variables after the loop completes is as described in the "Output State" section.
    min_additional_tiles = 2
    for (suit, numbers) in suits.items():
        min_additional_tiles = min(min_additional_tiles,
            tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers))

    return False
    #The program returns False
