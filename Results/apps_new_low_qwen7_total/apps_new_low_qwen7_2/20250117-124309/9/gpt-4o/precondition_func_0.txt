tiles is a string containing exactly three space-separated strings representing suited tiles. Each string consists of a digit from 1 to 9 followed by a lowercase letter m, p, or s, indicating the suit. The function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` and `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` are assumed to be defined elsewhere and work correctly.
