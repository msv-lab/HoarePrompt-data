The function accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `a`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l, r, a \leq 100\). It adjusts the values of `l` and `r` based on the value of `a` and then calculates the maximum team size. Specifically, it ensures that `l` and `r` are updated to their closest reachable values given the constraint that `a` can be used to increase either `l` or `r` by at most `a`. If `r < l`, `r` is updated to `r + a` and `a` is set to 0. Otherwise, `l` is increased by the minimum of `a` and the difference between `r` and `l`. After updating `l` and `r`, the function calculates `max_team_size` as the sum of `l`, `r`, and half of `a` rounded down to the nearest integer, adjusting `max_team_size` to be even if necessary. Finally, it prints the calculated `max_team_size`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `a` is exactly equal to the difference between `l` and `r`, and the case where `r < l`, in which case `r` is updated to `r + a` and `a` is reset to 0.
