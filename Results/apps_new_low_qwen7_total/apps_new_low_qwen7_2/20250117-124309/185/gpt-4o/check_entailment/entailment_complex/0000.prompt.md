Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are at a water bowling training. There are l people who play with their left hand, r people, who play with their right hand, and a ambidexters, who can play with left or right hand.

The coach decided to form a team of even number of players, exactly half of the players should play with their right hand, and exactly half of the players should play with their left hand. One player should use only on of his hands.

Ambidexters play as well with their right hand as with their left hand. In the team, an ambidexter can play with their left hand, or with their right hand.

Please find the maximum possible size of the team, where equal number of players use their left and right hands, respectively.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers l, r and a (0 ≤ l, r, a ≤ 100) — the number of left-handers, the number of right-handers and the number of ambidexters at the training. 


-----Output-----

Print a single even integer — the maximum number of players in the team. It is possible that the team can only have zero number of players.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 4 2

Output
6

Input
5 5 5

Output
14

Input
0 2 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example you can form a team of 6 players. You should take the only left-hander and two ambidexters to play with left hand, and three right-handers to play with right hand. The only person left can't be taken into the team.

In the second example you can form a team of 14 people. You have to take all five left-handers, all five right-handers, two ambidexters to play with left hand and two ambidexters to play with right hand.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, and a are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l, r, a <= 100.
def func():
    l, r, a = map(int, input().split())
    if (l < r) :
        l += min(a, r - l)

a -= min(a, r - l)
    else :
        if (r < l) :
            r += min(a, l - r)

a -= min(a, l - r)
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l` is `l_input`, `r` is `r_input`, `a` is `a_input`. If `r < l` is true, then `r` is updated to `r_input + a_input` and `a` is set to 0. Since there is no else part, these changes only occur when `r < l` is true.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `l` is `l_input + min(a_input, r_input - l_input)` and `a` is `a_input - min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, and `r` is `r_input` if `l < r`. If `r < l`, then `r` is updated to `r_input + a_input` and `a` is set to 0.
    max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
    if (max_team_size % 2 != 0) :
        max_team_size -= 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l` is `l_input + min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, `a` is `a_input - min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, `r` is `r_input` if `l < r` and 0 otherwise, and `max_team_size` is `l + r + a`. If `max_team_size` is an odd number, then `max_team_size` is adjusted to the nearest even number. Otherwise, `max_team_size` remains unchanged.
    print(max_team_size)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `a`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l, r, a \leq 100\). It adjusts the values of `l` and `r` based on the value of `a` and then calculates the maximum team size. Specifically, it ensures that `l` and `r` are updated to their closest reachable values given the constraint that `a` can be used to increase either `l` or `r` by at most `a`. If `r < l`, `r` is updated to `r + a` and `a` is set to 0. Otherwise, `l` is increased by the minimum of `a` and the difference between `r` and `l`. After updating `l` and `r`, the function calculates `max_team_size` as the sum of `l`, `r`, and half of `a` rounded down to the nearest integer, adjusting `max_team_size` to be even if necessary. Finally, it prints the calculated `max_team_size`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `a` is exactly equal to the difference between `l` and `r`, and the case where `r < l`, in which case `r` is updated to `r + a` and `a` is reset to 0.
