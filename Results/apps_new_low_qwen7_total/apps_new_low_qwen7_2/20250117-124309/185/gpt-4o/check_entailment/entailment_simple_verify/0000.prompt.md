You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are at a water bowling training. There are l people who play with their left hand, r people, who play with their right hand, and a ambidexters, who can play with left or right hand.

The coach decided to form a team of even number of players, exactly half of the players should play with their right hand, and exactly half of the players should play with their left hand. One player should use only on of his hands.

Ambidexters play as well with their right hand as with their left hand. In the team, an ambidexter can play with their left hand, or with their right hand.

Please find the maximum possible size of the team, where equal number of players use their left and right hands, respectively.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers l, r and a (0 ≤ l, r, a ≤ 100) — the number of left-handers, the number of right-handers and the number of ambidexters at the training. 


-----Output-----

Print a single even integer — the maximum number of players in the team. It is possible that the team can only have zero number of players.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 4 2

Output
6

Input
5 5 5

Output
14

Input
0 2 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example you can form a team of 6 players. You should take the only left-hander and two ambidexters to play with left hand, and three right-handers to play with right hand. The only person left can't be taken into the team.

In the second example you can form a team of 14 people. You have to take all five left-handers, all five right-handers, two ambidexters to play with left hand and two ambidexters to play with right hand.

- Program: 
def func():
    (l, r, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if l < r:
        l += min(a, r - l)
        a -= min(a, r - l)
    elif r < l:
        r += min(a, l - r)
        a -= min(a, l - r)
    max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
    if max_team_size % 2 != 0:
        max_team_size -= 1
    print(max_team_size)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, and a are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l, r, a <= 100.
def func():
    l, r, a = map(int, input().split())
    if (l < r) :
        l += min(a, r - l)

a -= min(a, r - l)
    else :
        if (r < l) :
            r += min(a, l - r)

a -= min(a, l - r)
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l` is `l_input`, `r` is `r_input`, `a` is `a_input`. If `r < l` is true, then `r` is updated to `r_input + a_input` and `a` is set to 0. Since there is no else part, these changes only occur when `r < l` is true.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `l` is `l_input + min(a_input, r_input - l_input)` and `a` is `a_input - min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, and `r` is `r_input` if `l < r`. If `r < l`, then `r` is updated to `r_input + a_input` and `a` is set to 0.
    max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
    if (max_team_size % 2 != 0) :
        max_team_size -= 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l` is `l_input + min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, `a` is `a_input - min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, `r` is `r_input` if `l < r` and 0 otherwise, and `max_team_size` is `l + r + a`. If `max_team_size` is an odd number, then `max_team_size` is adjusted to the nearest even number. Otherwise, `max_team_size` remains unchanged.
    print(max_team_size)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total number of players (including ambidexters) is odd, and it does not ensure that the final team size is always even. 

Consider the following input:
```
0 0 3
```
- According to the problem description, we should have `l=0`, `r=0`, and `a=3`. 
- The program adds the minimum number of ambidexters to the smaller group, which results in:
  - `l = 0 + min(3, 0 - 0) = 0`
  - `a = 3 - min(3, 0 - 0) = 3`
- Then it calculates the maximum team size as:
  - `max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2 = 0 + 0 + 3 // 2 * 2 = 3`
- Since 3 is not an even number, the program subtracts 1 to make it even, resulting in `max_team_size = 2`.

However, the correct output should be 0 because we cannot form a team with an equal number of players using their left and right hands. The program fails to handle this edge case properly.
