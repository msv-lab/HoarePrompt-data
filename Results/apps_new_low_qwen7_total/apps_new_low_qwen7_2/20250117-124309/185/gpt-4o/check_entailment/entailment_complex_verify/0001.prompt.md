You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are at a water bowling training. There are l people who play with their left hand, r people, who play with their right hand, and a ambidexters, who can play with left or right hand.

The coach decided to form a team of even number of players, exactly half of the players should play with their right hand, and exactly half of the players should play with their left hand. One player should use only on of his hands.

Ambidexters play as well with their right hand as with their left hand. In the team, an ambidexter can play with their left hand, or with their right hand.

Please find the maximum possible size of the team, where equal number of players use their left and right hands, respectively.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers l, r and a (0 ≤ l, r, a ≤ 100) — the number of left-handers, the number of right-handers and the number of ambidexters at the training. 


-----Output-----

Print a single even integer — the maximum number of players in the team. It is possible that the team can only have zero number of players.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 4 2

Output
6

Input
5 5 5

Output
14

Input
0 2 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example you can form a team of 6 players. You should take the only left-hander and two ambidexters to play with left hand, and three right-handers to play with right hand. The only person left can't be taken into the team.

In the second example you can form a team of 14 people. You have to take all five left-handers, all five right-handers, two ambidexters to play with left hand and two ambidexters to play with right hand.

- Program: 
def func():
    (l, r, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if l < r:
        l += min(a, r - l)
        a -= min(a, r - l)
    elif r < l:
        r += min(a, l - r)
        a -= min(a, l - r)
    max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
    if max_team_size % 2 != 0:
        max_team_size -= 1
    print(max_team_size)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, and a are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l, r, a <= 100.
def func():
    l, r, a = map(int, input().split())
    if (l < r) :
        l += min(a, r - l)

a -= min(a, r - l)
    else :
        if (r < l) :
            r += min(a, l - r)

a -= min(a, l - r)
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l` is `l_input`, `r` is `r_input`, `a` is `a_input`. If `r < l` is true, then `r` is updated to `r_input + a_input` and `a` is set to 0. Since there is no else part, these changes only occur when `r < l` is true.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `l` is `l_input + min(a_input, r_input - l_input)` and `a` is `a_input - min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, and `r` is `r_input` if `l < r`. If `r < l`, then `r` is updated to `r_input + a_input` and `a` is set to 0.
    max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
    if (max_team_size % 2 != 0) :
        max_team_size -= 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l` is `l_input + min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, `a` is `a_input - min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, `r` is `r_input` if `l < r` and 0 otherwise, and `max_team_size` is `l + r + a`. If `max_team_size` is an odd number, then `max_team_size` is adjusted to the nearest even number. Otherwise, `max_team_size` remains unchanged.
    print(max_team_size)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `a`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l, r, a \leq 100\). It adjusts the values of `l` and `r` based on the value of `a` and then calculates the maximum team size. Specifically, it ensures that `l` and `r` are updated to their closest reachable values given the constraint that `a` can be used to increase either `l` or `r` by at most `a`. If `r < l`, `r` is updated to `r + a` and `a` is set to 0. Otherwise, `l` is increased by the minimum of `a` and the difference between `r` and `l`. After updating `l` and `r`, the function calculates `max_team_size` as the sum of `l`, `r`, and half of `a` rounded down to the nearest integer, adjusting `max_team_size` to be even if necessary. Finally, it prints the calculated `max_team_size`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `a` is exactly equal to the difference between `l` and `r`, and the case where `r < l`, in which case `r` is updated to `r + a` and `a` is reset to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program aims to calculate the maximum possible size of a team where the number of players using their left hand is equal to the number of players using their right hand. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input values for `l`, `r`, and `a` (the number of left-handers, right-handers, and ambidexters, respectively) using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Balancing Hands**: 
   - If there are more right-handers than left-handers (`r > l`), the program adjusts the count of left-handers by adding the minimum of `a` (ambidexters) and the difference between right-handers and left-handers (`r - l`). This ensures that the number of left-handers can be brought up to match or exceed the number of right-handers.
   - Similarly, if there are more left-handers than right-handers (`l > r`), the program adjusts the count of right-handers by adding the minimum of `a` and the difference between left-handers and right-handers (`l - r`).

3. **Calculating Maximum Team Size**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible team size by summing the adjusted counts of left-handers and right-handers (`l + r`) and adding half of the remaining ambidexters (`a // 2 * 2`).
   - It then checks if this calculated size is odd and reduces it by 1 if necessary to ensure the team size is even.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final calculated team size.

This approach correctly balances the number of left-handers and right-handers and ensures the team size is even, as required by the problem statement. The logic handles all edge cases such as when one group has more members or when no ambidexters are available to balance the hands.
