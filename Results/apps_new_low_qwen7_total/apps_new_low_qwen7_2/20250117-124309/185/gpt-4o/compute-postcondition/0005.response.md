Given the initial state where `r < l` is true, `l` is `l_input`, `r` is `r_input`, and `a` is `a_input`, we need to execute the following code block:

```python
r += min(a, l - r)
a -= min(a, l - r)
```

Let's break down the execution of these lines:

1. **First Line: `r += min(a, l - r)`**
   - Calculate `min(a, l - r)`: Since `r < l` is true, `l - r` is positive, and it's greater than or equal to `a` if `a` is the smaller value. So, `min(a, l - r)` is either `a` or `l - r`, whichever is smaller.
   - Add this value to `r`. This updates `r` to `r + min(a, l - r)`.

2. **Second Line: `a -= min(a, l - r)`**
   - Subtract `min(a, l - r)` from `a`. This updates `a` to `a - min(a, l - r)`.

Since `r < l` is true, letâ€™s assume without loss of generality that `a <= l - r`. If `a` were larger than `l - r`, the assignment would stop at `r + (l - r) = l`, but since `a <= l - r`, `a` will be fully subtracted in one step. Therefore, both lines effectively make `a` zero and adjust `r` to `r + a`.

Thus, after executing the code block:
- `a` becomes 0 because it is fully subtracted.
- `r` becomes `r_input + a_input` because `r` is incremented by `a_input`.

The final state is:

Output State: **`l` is `l_input`, `r` is `r_input + a_input`, `a` is 0**
