Postcondition: ***`l` is `l_input + min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, `a` is `a_input - min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, `r` is `r_input` if `l < r` and 0 otherwise, and `max_team_size` is `l + r + a`. If `max_team_size` is an odd number, then `max_team_size` is adjusted to the nearest even number. Otherwise, `max_team_size` remains unchanged.***
