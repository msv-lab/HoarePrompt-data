Initial State: `l` is `l_input`, `r` is `r_input`, `a` is `a_input`. The condition `l < r` is true.
```
l += min(a, r - l)
a -= min(a, r - l)
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `l += min(a, r - l)` updates `l` by adding the minimum value between `a` and `r - l` to it.
2. The second line `a -= min(a, r - l)` updates `a` by subtracting the same minimum value from it.

Since both `l` and `a` are modified based on the same minimum value, let's denote this minimum value as `min_val`.

Let's assume `min_val = min(a, r - l)`. After the first line, `l` becomes `l + min_val`. Then, after the second line, `a` becomes `a - min_val`.

The updated values are:
- `l` becomes `l_input + min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`
- `a` becomes `a_input - min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`

No other variables are affected.

Final Output State: **l is l_input + min(a_input, r_input - l_input), a is a_input - min(a_input, r_input - l_input), r is r_input**
