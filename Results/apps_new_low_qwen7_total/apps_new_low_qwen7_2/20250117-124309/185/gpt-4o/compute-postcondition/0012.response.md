The code `print(max_team_size)` simply prints the value of the variable `max_team_size` without changing its value. Therefore, the only thing that happens is the output of `max_team_size`.

Given the initial state, the values of `l`, `a`, `r`, and `max_team_size` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is `l_input + min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, `a` is `a_input - min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, `r` is `r_input` if `l < r` and 0 otherwise, `max_team_size` is `l + r + a`, and we print the value of `max_team_size`.**
