The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to variables `l`, `r`, and `a`. Since the input values are not specified in the initial state, we can denote the input values as `l_input`, `r_input`, and `a_input`.

Impact of the code:
- `l` is assigned the value of `l_input`.
- `r` is assigned the value of `r_input`.
- `a` is assigned the value of `a_input`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is `l_input`, `r` is `r_input`, `a` is `a_input`**
