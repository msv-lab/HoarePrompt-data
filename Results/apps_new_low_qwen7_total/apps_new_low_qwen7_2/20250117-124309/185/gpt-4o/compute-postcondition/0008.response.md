First, let's analyze the initial state and the given code snippet.

### Initial State
- `l` is calculated as `l_input + min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`
- `a` is calculated as `a_input - min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`
- `r` is `r_input` if `l < r`. If `r < l`, then `r` is updated to `r_input + a_input` and `a` is set to 0.

### Code Snippet
```python
max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Calculate `max_team_size`:**
   - The expression `l + r + a // 2 * 2` is evaluated.
   - `a // 2 * 2` simplifies to just `a` because integer division followed by multiplication by 2 is equivalent to `a`.

2. **Update the Values:**
   - The value of `max_team_size` is assigned to the expression `l + r + a`.
   - The values of `l`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state because no assignment back to these variables occurs in the code.

### Output State
- The only new variable introduced or modified is `max_team_size`, which is the sum of `l`, `r`, and `a`.
- The original variables `l`, `a`, and `r` retain their initial values.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`l` is `l_input + min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, `a` is `a_input - min(a_input, r_input - l_input)`, `r` is `r_input` if `l < r` and 0 otherwise, and `max_team_size` is `l + r + a`**.
