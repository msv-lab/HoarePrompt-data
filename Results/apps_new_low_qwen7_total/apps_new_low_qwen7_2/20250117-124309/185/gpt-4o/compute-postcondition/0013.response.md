The function `func` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `a`. These parameters are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l, r, a \leq 100\). The function does not return anything directly mentioned in the provided output cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three non-negative integers `l`, `r`, and `a` within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `a`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l, r, a \leq 100\).**
