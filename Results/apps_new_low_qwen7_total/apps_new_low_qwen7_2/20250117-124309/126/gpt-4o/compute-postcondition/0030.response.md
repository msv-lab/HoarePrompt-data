The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n` (which is implied by the range function). Given the provided code, the loop's continuation depends on the value of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
- `traffic_lights` is a list of integers
- `accident_possible` remains `True`
- `i` is `3`
- `l` is `3`
- `s` is `4`
- `r` is `5`
- `p` is `1`
- `j` is `2`

Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(4)`, the loop will continue as long as `i < 4`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `3`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `4`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `accident_possible` remains `True`, `i` is `4`, `l` is `3`, `s` is `4`, `r` is `5`, `p` is `1`, `j` is `2`**
