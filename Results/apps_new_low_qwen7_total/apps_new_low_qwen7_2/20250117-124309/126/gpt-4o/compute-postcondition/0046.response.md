The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop or structure being broken out of is exited. Given that no loop or structure is specified in the provided code, the only impact is that the program exits the current loop or structure. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`accident_possible` is `True`, `i` is `4`, `traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `j` is `2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
