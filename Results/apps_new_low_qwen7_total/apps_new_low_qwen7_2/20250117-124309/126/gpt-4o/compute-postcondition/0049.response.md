Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `range(4)`.
2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < 4`.
3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `accident_possible` remains `True`
   - `i` is `4`
   - `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index 4 of `traffic_lights`
   - `j` is `2`

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `4`, it is equal to `4`, which means the loop condition `i < 4` is no longer satisfied.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute another iteration because `i` has reached its upper limit.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that the loop will not execute another iteration, there is no need to adjust the states of `i`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, or `j`. The states of these variables remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`accident_possible` remains `True`, `i` is `4`, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `j` is `2`**
