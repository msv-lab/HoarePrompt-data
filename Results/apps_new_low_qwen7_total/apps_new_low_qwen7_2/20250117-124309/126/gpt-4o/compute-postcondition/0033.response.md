Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `accident_possible` is `False`, `i` is `4`, `l` is the value at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `s` is the value at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `r` is the value at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `p` is the value at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `j` is `2`. If any of `l`, `s`, or `r` equals `1`, then `accident_possible` becomes `False`. Otherwise, the values of `accident_possible`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
