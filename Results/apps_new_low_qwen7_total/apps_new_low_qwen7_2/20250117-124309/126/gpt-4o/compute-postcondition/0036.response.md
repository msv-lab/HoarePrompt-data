Output State: **accident_possible is True, i is 4, traffic_lights is a list of integers, l, s, r, and p are the values at index 4 of traffic_lights, j is 0** 

Explanation: 
- The first and only line of the code sets `accident_possible` to `True`.
- All other variables (`i`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, `j`) remain unchanged because they are not reassigned or used in any way within the given code block. 
- The value of `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` is not explicitly changed, but it is mentioned that this value is `1` before the code execution, and there's no operation affecting this specific element in the list. Therefore, the value `1` remains the same.
