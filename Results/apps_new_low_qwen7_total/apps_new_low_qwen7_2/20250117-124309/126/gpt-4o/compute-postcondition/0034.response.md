Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(3)`. This means the loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = 2`.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `traffic_lights` is a list of integers.
   - `accident_possible` is `False`.
   - `i` is `4`.
   - `l` is the value at index 4 of `traffic_lights`.
   - `s` is the value at index 4 of `traffic_lights`.
   - `r` is the value at index 4 of `traffic_lights`.
   - `p` is the value at index 4 of `traffic_lights`.
   - `j` is `2`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be within the range specified by `range(3)`, which means `j` must be `0`.

4. **States in the Loop Head**:
   - `i` remains `4` because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are still the values at index `4` of `traffic_lights`.
   - `j` must change from `2` to `0` for the loop to execute the first time.

5. **Condition for `accident_possible`**: The condition `if any of l, s, or r equals 1` will not affect the initial states since we are considering the state just before the loop starts. However, it is important to note that if any of `l`, `s`, or `r` equals `1` during the loop execution, `accident_possible` will become `True`. But for the loop to execute the first time, this condition does not need to be evaluated.

Given these points, the states that must hold true for the loop to execute the first time are:

- `i` is `4`.
- `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index `4` of `traffic_lights`.
- `j` must be `0` for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`total` is not relevant, `traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `accident_possible` is `False`, `i` is `4`, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `j` must be `0`**
