The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not change the values of any variables. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is `[3, 4, 5, ...]`, `accident_possible` is `True`, `i` is `4`, `l` is `...`, `s` is `...`, `r` is `...`, `p` is `...`, `j` is `2` or `3` depending on the iteration that caused the loop to break. The condition `accident_possible` is true; 'YES' is printed to the console.**
