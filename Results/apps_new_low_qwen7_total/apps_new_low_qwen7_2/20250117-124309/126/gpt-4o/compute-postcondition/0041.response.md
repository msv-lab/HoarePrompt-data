Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `accident_possible` is `True`
   - `i` is `4`
   - `traffic_lights` is a list of integers
   - `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index `4` of `traffic_lights`
   - `j` is `1`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(3):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `2`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the value at index `(i + j) % 4` and position `j` of `traffic_lights` is `1`.
   - If it is `1`, the condition remains unchanged (`accident_possible` stays `True`).
   - If it is not `1`, there is no change to the variables since there is no else part specified.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `j` is currently `1` (end of the previous iteration).

5. **Next Iteration of the Loop:**
   - In the next iteration, `j` will be `2`.

6. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to check the condition for `j = 2`.
   - The index to check in `traffic_lights` will be `(i + j) % 4`, which is `(4 + 2) % 4 = 2`.
   - The values at this index are `r` (since `j` is `2` and `r` is the value at index `2` of `traffic_lights`).

7. **Possible States After the Next Iteration:**
   - If `r` is `1`, `accident_possible` remains `True`.
   - If `r` is not `1`, `accident_possible` remains `True` but no other state changes.

Since the only possible change is in the value of `r` and its effect on `accident_possible`, and given that the problem does not specify any change if `r` is not `1`, we assume the condition remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`accident_possible` is `True`, `i` is `4`, `traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `j` is `2**.
