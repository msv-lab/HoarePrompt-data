Postcondition: ***`accident_possible` remains `True`, `i` is `4`, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `j` is `2`. For any `j` from `0` to `2`, if `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1`, `accident_possible` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains `True` as no condition was met.***
