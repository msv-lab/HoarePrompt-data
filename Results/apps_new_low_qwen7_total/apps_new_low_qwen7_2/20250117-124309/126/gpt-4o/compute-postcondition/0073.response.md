Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` remains as a list of integers starting from 3, `accident_possible` is either `True` or `False`, `i` is `4`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, and `j` maintain their respective states depending on the iteration that caused the loop to break. If `accident_possible` is `True`, the console prints 'YES'. If `accident_possible` is `False`, the console prints 'NO'.***
