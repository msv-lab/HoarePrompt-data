The function `func` accepts no parameters. It processes input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian) for each of the four road parts. The possible values for each light are 0 for red and 1 for green. Based on this input, the function determines the current traffic light configuration but does not return any specific value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the given input representing traffic light states for four road parts.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian) for each of the four road parts.**
