Postcondition: ***`accident_possible` remains true if any of `traffic_lights[4][0]`, `traffic_lights[4][1]`, or `traffic_lights[4][2]` is 1. After executing the if statement, `accident_possible` remains true if at least one of these conditions is met, and `i` is 4, `j` is 3, with `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` being the values at index 4 of `traffic_lights`. If none of these conditions are met, `accident_possible` becomes false.***
