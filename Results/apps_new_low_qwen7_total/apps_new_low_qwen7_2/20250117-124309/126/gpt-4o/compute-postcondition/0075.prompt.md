You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian) for each of the four road parts. The possible values for each light are 0 for red and 1 for green.
def func():
    traffic_lights = []
    for _ in range(4):
        traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `traffic_lights` is `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The initial state of `traffic_lights` is an empty list: `[]`.
    #   - The loop runs for a fixed number of times, specified by `range(4)`, meaning it will execute exactly 4 times.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - Each iteration of the loop appends a new list of integers (obtained from `input().split()`) to `traffic_lights`.
    #   - No other variable is mentioned or modified within the loop, so `traffic_lights` is the only variable changing.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - Since the loop runs exactly 4 times, each iteration will append a new list of integers to `traffic_lights`.
    #   - After the first iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers]`.
    #   - After the second iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5]]`.
    #   - After the third iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input]`.
    #   - After the fourth iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The output states provided match the behavior of appending lists in each iteration.
    #   - Since the loop always runs 4 times regardless of the input values, there are no conditions under which the loop does not execute.
    #
    #Therefore, after all 4 executions of the loop, the final state of `traffic_lights` is as described above.
    accident_possible = False
    for i in range(4):
        l, s, r, p = traffic_lights[i]
        
        if p == 1:
            if l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1:
                accident_possible = True
                break
            for j in range(3):
                if traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1:
                    accident_possible = True
                    break
            if accident_possible:
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `traffic_lights` is `[3, 4, 5, ...]`, `accident_possible` is `True`, `i` is `4`, `l` is `...`, `s` is `...`, `r` is `...`, `p` is `...`, `j` is `2` or `3` depending on the iteration that caused the loop to break.
    if accident_possible :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`traffic_lights` remains as a list of integers starting from 3, `accident_possible` is either `True` or `False`, `i` is `4`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, and `j` maintain their respective states depending on the iteration that caused the loop to break. If `accident_possible` is `True`, the console prints 'YES'. If `accident_possible` is `False`, the console prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and processes input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian) for each of the four road parts.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
