Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `accident_possible` remains `True`, `i` is `3`, `l` is `3`, `s` is `4`, `r` is `5`, `p` is `1`, `j` is `2`. If `p` equals `1`, the accident_possible condition is met, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as stated in the if part.***
