`l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are assigned the values from the list `traffic_lights` at index `i`. Since `i` is 4, the values of `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are updated to the values at index 4 of the `traffic_lights` list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `accident_possible` remains `True`, `i` is `4`, `l` is the value at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `s` is the value at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `r` is the value at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `p` is the value at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `j` is `2`**
