Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `accident_possible` remains `True`, `i` is 0, `l` is 3, `s` is 4, `r` is 5, `p` is 1, `j` is 2. If the condition `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1` evaluates to true, then `accident_possible` becomes `False`. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
