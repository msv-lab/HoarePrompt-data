The code `break` is executed inside a loop or conditional statement, and it breaks out of the innermost loop or statement it is within. Since the initial state mentions that the condition inside the if statement is met (meaning `accident_possible` is `True`), the `break` statement would cause us to exit that if statement or loop. No variables are assigned new values by this statement.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `accident_possible` remains `True`, `i` is `3`, `l` is `3`, `s` is `4`, `r` is `5`, `p` is `1`, `j` is `2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
