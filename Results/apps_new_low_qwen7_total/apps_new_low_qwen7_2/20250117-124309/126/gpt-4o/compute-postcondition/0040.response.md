Postcondition: ***`accident_possible` is `True`, `i` is `4`, `traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index 4 of `traffic_lights`, `j` is `1`. If the value at index `(i + j) % 4` and position `j` of `traffic_lights` is `1`, then the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables since there is no else part specified.***
