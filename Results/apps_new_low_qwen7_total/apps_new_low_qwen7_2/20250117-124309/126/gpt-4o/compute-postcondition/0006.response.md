The code appends a new list, which is created by converting each element of the space-separated input into an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, to the `traffic_lights` list. Since the initial state of `traffic_lights` is `[initial_traffic_lights, [3, 4, 5]]`, after the code executes, `traffic_lights` will be updated to include the newly created list.

Let's denote the input as `user_input`, which is a space-separated string of integers. After converting it to a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`, it will be appended to `traffic_lights`.

Thus, the updated state of `traffic_lights` will be `[initial_traffic_lights, [3, 4, 5], user_input]`.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is `[initial_traffic_lights, [3, 4, 5], user_input]`**
