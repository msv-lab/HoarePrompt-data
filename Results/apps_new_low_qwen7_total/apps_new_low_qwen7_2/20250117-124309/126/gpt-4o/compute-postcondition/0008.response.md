The code snippet assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `accident_possible`. This variable was not initially defined in the initial state, so its assignment here directly changes its value.

The initial state provided includes `traffic_lights` being `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`. The assignment of `accident_possible` does not affect this list.

Thus, the only change is the introduction and assignment of `accident_possible` to `False`.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`; `accident_possible` is `False`**
