The first line does not change the value of `accident_possible`, it just reassigns it to `True`. However, the second line is a `break` statement, which is typically used inside loops to exit them. Since there is no loop context provided, this `break` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. Given that there are no further assignments or operations that modify the variables, the final state remains unchanged.

Output State: **accident_possible is True, i is 4, traffic_lights is a list of integers, l, s, r, p are the values at index 4 of traffic_lights, j is 1**
