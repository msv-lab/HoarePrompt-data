Functionality: **The function processes input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian) for each of the four road parts. It then checks whether an accident is possible based on the traffic light states and prints 'YES' if an accident is possible, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of lines or integers). The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle such errors. Additionally, the function does not validate the range of integers (0 or 1) for the traffic light states, which could lead to incorrect results if non-binary values are provided.**

After the function concludes, the final state of the program includes:
- `traffic_lights`: A list of lists, where each inner list contains four integers representing the state of the traffic lights for each of the four road parts.
- `accident_possible`: A boolean indicating whether an accident is possible based on the traffic light states.
- `i`: The index of the last iteration of the loop, which is always set to 4 after the loop completes.
- `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`: The values of the traffic lights for the current road part being checked, which are only defined within the scope of the inner loop.
- `j`: The index used in the inner loop, which is only defined within the scope of the inner loop and takes a value between 0 and 2 depending on the iteration that caused the loop to break.

The function checks for accidents by verifying if any pedestrian light is green (`p == 1`) while any left, straight, or right light is also green (`l == 1`, `s == 1`, or `r == 1`). If such a condition is met, an accident is considered possible. Additionally, the function checks for accidents in adjacent road parts by iterating through the next three road parts and checking if any of their corresponding lights are green. If an accident is detected, the function breaks out of the loops and prints 'YES'. If no accident is found, it prints 'NO'.
