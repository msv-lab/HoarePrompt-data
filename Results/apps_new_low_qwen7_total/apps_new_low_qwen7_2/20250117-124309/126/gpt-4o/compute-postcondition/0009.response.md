Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `traffic_lights` is `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`
- `accident_possible` is `False`

### For Loop Statement
```
for i in range(4):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable `i` is used in the `range(4)` function, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to 3 inclusive.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(4)`, i.e., `0 <= i < 4`.

### Step-by-Step Verification
- Before entering the loop, `i` should be 0 (the starting value).
- The loop condition checks if `i` is less than 4, so `i` must be in the range `[0, 3]`.

### State Required for First Execution
- `i` must be 0.
- There are no other variables directly controlling the loop execution based on the given information.

### Final State for Loop Execution
- `traffic_lights` remains `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`.
- `accident_possible` remains `False`.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute the first time, the only necessary condition is that `i` is 0.

### Final Answer
State: **`traffic_lights` is `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`, `accident_possible` is `False`, `i` is 0**
