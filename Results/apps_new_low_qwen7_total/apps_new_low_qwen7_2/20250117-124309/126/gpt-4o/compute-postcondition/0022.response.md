Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `traffic_lights` is a list of integers.
   - `accident_possible` remains `True`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l` is 3.
   - `s` is 4.
   - `r` is 5.
   - `p` is 1.
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Loop Header:**
   ```python
   for j in range(3):
   ```

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 2 (inclusive).
   - In each iteration, the condition `accident_possible = traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1` is checked.
   - If `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` equals 1, `accident_possible` becomes `False`.
   - Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains `True`.

4. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - We need to check if `traffic_lights[(i + 2) % 4][2]` affects `accident_possible`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `j`, which will be set to 2.
   - All other variables (`i`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, `accident_possible`, and `traffic_lights`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

7. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `traffic_lights` remains a list of integers.
   - `accident_possible` remains `True` unless the condition is met.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `l` remains 3.
   - `s` remains 4.
   - `r` remains 5.
   - `p` remains 1.
   - `j` is now 2.

Given this analysis, the final state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `accident_possible` remains `True`, `i` is 0, `l` is 3, `s` is 4, `r` is 5, `p` is 1, `j` is 2**
