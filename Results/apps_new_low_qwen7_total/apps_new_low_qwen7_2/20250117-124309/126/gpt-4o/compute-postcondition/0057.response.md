The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p`. Since the loop starts with `j` being 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. The loop will continue if `accident_possible` is still `True`.

Let's go through the steps:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, `i` is 4, and `accident_possible` is `True`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from 2 to 3.
3. We need to check the condition `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` to determine if `accident_possible` remains `True`.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 and the loop will continue if `accident_possible` remains `True`, we can proceed with `j` being 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`accident_possible` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index 4 of `traffic_lights`**
