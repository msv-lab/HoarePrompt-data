Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(3)`, which means `j` will take values from 0 to 2.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `accident_possible` is `False`
   - `i` is `4`
   - `j` is `3`
   - `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index 4 of `traffic_lights`

3. **Determine the new value of `j`**: Since the loop is `for j in range(3)`, and `j` was `3` at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `j` has gone through all its possible values (0, 1, 2) and has wrapped around to `3`. However, since `range(3)` does not include 3, `j` cannot be 3 at the end of the loop. This implies that the loop has completed its iterations.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since `j` is out of the range defined by `range(3)`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, we do not need to change the value of `j`.

5. **Other variables**: The other variables (`accident_possible`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given these observations, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the current state because the loop will not execute again.

**Final State**:
State: **`accident_possible` is False, `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index 4 of `traffic_lights`**
