Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(4):`. The loop variable here is an underscore `_`, which means it's not actually used in the loop body. However, the loop itself runs 4 times.

2. **Determine the number of iterations left**: Since the loop has already run, and there were 4 iterations in total, we need to determine how many iterations remain. If the loop has run once, then 3 iterations are left.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop has already run once, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that one iteration has completed. This means the loop will run 3 more times from the start of the next iteration.

Given that the loop has already run once, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- The loop will run 3 more times.
- No specific changes to `traffic_lights` or other variables since the loop head does not depend on them directly.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`traffic_lights` is `[list_of_integers]`**
