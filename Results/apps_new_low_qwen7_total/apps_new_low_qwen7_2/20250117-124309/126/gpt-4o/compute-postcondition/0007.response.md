Output State: `traffic_lights` is `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`.

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The initial state of `traffic_lights` is an empty list: `[]`.
   - The loop runs for a fixed number of times, specified by `range(4)`, meaning it will execute exactly 4 times.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - Each iteration of the loop appends a new list of integers (obtained from `input().split()`) to `traffic_lights`.
   - No other variable is mentioned or modified within the loop, so `traffic_lights` is the only variable changing.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - Since the loop runs exactly 4 times, each iteration will append a new list of integers to `traffic_lights`.
   - After the first iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers]`.
   - After the second iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5]]`.
   - After the third iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input]`.
   - After the fourth iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The output states provided match the behavior of appending lists in each iteration.
   - Since the loop always runs 4 times regardless of the input values, there are no conditions under which the loop does not execute.

Therefore, after all 4 executions of the loop, the final state of `traffic_lights` is as described above.
