Postcondition: **`traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `accident_possible` remains `True`, `i` is `0`, `l` is `3`, `s` is `4`, `r` is `5`, `p` is `1`, `j` is `0`. If `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` equals `1`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables also remains unchanged since there is no modification in the else part.**
