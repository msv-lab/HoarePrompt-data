The code appends a list of integers (converted from user input) to the `traffic_lights` list. Since the initial state of `traffic_lights` is an empty list, after appending the new list, `traffic_lights` will contain the newly added list. However, the specific values in the input list are not provided, so we will denote them generically.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is `[list_of_integers]`**
