The code appends a new list of integers, converted from user input, to the existing `traffic_lights` list. Since the initial state of `traffic_lights` is given as `[list_of_integers]`, let's denote this list as `initial_traffic_lights`. The user input will be split into a list of integers, which will be appended to `traffic_lights`.

Let's assume the user inputs "3 4 5" (for example), then `input().split()` would result in `['3', '4', '5']`, and `map(int, input().split())` would convert these strings to integers resulting in `[3, 4, 5]`. This new list is then appended to `traffic_lights`.

The output state will reflect the updated `traffic_lights` list.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is `[initial_traffic_lights, [3, 4, 5]]`**
