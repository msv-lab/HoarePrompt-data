The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or switch statement it is within. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`accident_possible` is True because at least one of `traffic_lights[4][0]`, `traffic_lights[4][1]`, or `traffic_lights[4][2]` is 1; `i` is 4; `j` is 3; `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are the values at index 4 of `traffic_lights`.**
