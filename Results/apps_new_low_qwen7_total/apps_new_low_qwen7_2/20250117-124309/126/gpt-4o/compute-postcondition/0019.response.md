Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(3)`, which means the variables `j` are within the loop head.

2. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `traffic_lights` is a list of integers.
   - `accident_possible` remains `True`.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `l` is `3`.
   - `s` is `4`.
   - `r` is `5`.
   - `p` is `1`.
   - `j` is `0`.

3. **Loop Condition and Effects**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `2` (inclusive).
   - For each value of `j`, the condition `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
   - If the condition is false, the state of the variables remains unchanged as well (since no modifications are made in the else part).

4. **Determine New State**:
   - Since the loop has completed one iteration (`j = 0`), the next iteration will start with `j = 1`.
   - All other variables (`traffic_lights`, `accident_possible`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the only variable that changes is `j`, which will now be `1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`traffic_lights` is a list of integers, `accident_possible` remains `True`, `i` is `0`, `l` is `3`, `s` is `4`, `r` is `5`, `p` is `1`, `j` is `1`**.
