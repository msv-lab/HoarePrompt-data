The function processes input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian) for each of the four road parts. It then checks whether an accident is possible based on the traffic light states and prints 'YES' if an accident is possible, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of lines or integers). The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle such errors. Additionally, the function does not validate the range of integers (0 or 1) for the traffic light states, which could lead to incorrect results if non-binary values are provided.
