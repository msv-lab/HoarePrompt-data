#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian) for each of the four road parts. The possible values for each light are 0 for red and 1 for green.
def func():
    traffic_lights = []
    for _ in range(4):
        traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `traffic_lights` is `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The initial state of `traffic_lights` is an empty list: `[]`.
    #   - The loop runs for a fixed number of times, specified by `range(4)`, meaning it will execute exactly 4 times.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - Each iteration of the loop appends a new list of integers (obtained from `input().split()`) to `traffic_lights`.
    #   - No other variable is mentioned or modified within the loop, so `traffic_lights` is the only variable changing.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - Since the loop runs exactly 4 times, each iteration will append a new list of integers to `traffic_lights`.
    #   - After the first iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers]`.
    #   - After the second iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5]]`.
    #   - After the third iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input]`.
    #   - After the fourth iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The output states provided match the behavior of appending lists in each iteration.
    #   - Since the loop always runs 4 times regardless of the input values, there are no conditions under which the loop does not execute.
    #
    #Therefore, after all 4 executions of the loop, the final state of `traffic_lights` is as described above.
    accident_possible = False
    for i in range(4):
        l, s, r, p = traffic_lights[i]
        
        if p == 1:
            if l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1:
                accident_possible = True
                break
            for j in range(3):
                if traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1:
                    accident_possible = True
                    break
            if accident_possible:
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `traffic_lights` is `[3, 4, 5, ...]`, `accident_possible` is `True`, `i` is `4`, `l` is `...`, `s` is `...`, `r` is `...`, `p` is `...`, `j` is `2` or `3` depending on the iteration that caused the loop to break.
    if accident_possible :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`traffic_lights` remains as a list of integers starting from 3, `accident_possible` is either `True` or `False`, `i` is `4`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, and `j` maintain their respective states depending on the iteration that caused the loop to break. If `accident_possible` is `True`, the console prints 'YES'. If `accident_possible` is `False`, the console prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian) for each of the four road parts. It then checks whether an accident is possible based on the traffic light states and prints 'YES' if an accident is possible, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of lines or integers). The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle such errors. Additionally, the function does not validate the range of integers (0 or 1) for the traffic light states, which could lead to incorrect results if non-binary values are provided.
