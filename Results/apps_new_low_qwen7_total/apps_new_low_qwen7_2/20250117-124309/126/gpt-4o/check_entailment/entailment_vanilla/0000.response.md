### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly detects if an accident is possible based on the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the configuration of the traffic lights for each of the four parts of the intersection.
   - This is correctly implemented using a loop that reads four lines of input and converts them into a list of lists, `traffic_lights`.

2. **Detecting Accidents:**
   - The program iterates through each part (i.e., each set of traffic lights).
   - For each part, it checks if the pedestrian light (`p`) is green (i.e., `p == 1`).
   - If the pedestrian light is green, it checks the other three types of traffic lights (`l`, `s`, `r`), and if any of these lights are also green, an accident is possible.
   - If the pedestrian light is green but none of the other lights are green, the program then checks the corresponding lane in the adjacent parts to see if any of those are green. This check is done using a nested loop iterating over the adjacent parts.
   - If any accident condition is found during these checks, the variable `accident_possible` is set to `True`.

3. **Output:**
   - After checking all parts, if `accident_possible` is still `False`, the program prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

This approach correctly implements the logic to detect if an accident is possible based on the given problem constraints. It checks both direct and indirect conditions for accidents (i.e., if a pedestrian light is green and any corresponding lane light is also green).

### Conclusion:
The provided program accurately implements the required logic to determine if an accident is possible based on the traffic light configurations.

### Correctness:
**True**
