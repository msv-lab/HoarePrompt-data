You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads. Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l — left, s — straight, r — right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] 

An accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.

Now, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.

Each line contains four integers l, s, r, p — for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.


-----Output-----

On a single line, print "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1

Output
YES

Input
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1

Output
NO

Input
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4.

In the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So, no accident can occur.

- Program:
def func():
    traffic_lights = []
    for _ in range(4):
        traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
    accident_possible = False
    for i in range(4):
        (l, s, r, p) = traffic_lights[i]
        if p == 1:
            if l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1:
                accident_possible = True
                break
            for j in range(3):
                if traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1:
                    accident_possible = True
                    break
            if accident_possible:
                break
    if accident_possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian) for each of the four road parts. It then checks whether an accident is possible based on the traffic light states and prints 'YES' if an accident is possible, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of lines or integers). The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle such errors. Additionally, the function does not validate the range of integers (0 or 1) for the traffic light states, which could lead to incorrect results if non-binary values are provided.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly detects if an accident is possible based on the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the configuration of the traffic lights for each of the four parts of the intersection.
   - This is correctly implemented using a loop that reads four lines of input and converts them into a list of lists, `traffic_lights`.

2. **Detecting Accidents:**
   - The program iterates through each part (i.e., each set of traffic lights).
   - For each part, it checks if the pedestrian light (`p`) is green (i.e., `p == 1`).
   - If the pedestrian light is green, it checks the other three types of traffic lights (`l`, `s`, `r`), and if any of these lights are also green, an accident is possible.
   - If the pedestrian light is green but none of the other lights are green, the program then checks the corresponding lane in the adjacent parts to see if any of those are green. This check is done using a nested loop iterating over the adjacent parts.
   - If any accident condition is found during these checks, the variable `accident_possible` is set to `True`.

3. **Output:**
   - After checking all parts, if `accident_possible` is still `False`, the program prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

This approach correctly implements the logic to detect if an accident is possible based on the given problem constraints. It checks both direct and indirect conditions for accidents (i.e., if a pedestrian light is green and any corresponding lane light is also green).

### Conclusion:
The provided program accurately implements the required logic to determine if an accident is possible based on the traffic light configurations.

### Correctness:
**True**
