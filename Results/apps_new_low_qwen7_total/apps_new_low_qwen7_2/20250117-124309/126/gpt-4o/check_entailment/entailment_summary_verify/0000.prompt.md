You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads. Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l — left, s — straight, r — right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] 

An accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.

Now, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.

Each line contains four integers l, s, r, p — for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.


-----Output-----

On a single line, print "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1

Output
YES

Input
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1

Output
NO

Input
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4.

In the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So, no accident can occur.

- Program:
def func():
    traffic_lights = []
    for _ in range(4):
        traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
    accident_possible = False
    for i in range(4):
        (l, s, r, p) = traffic_lights[i]
        if p == 1:
            if l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1:
                accident_possible = True
                break
            for j in range(3):
                if traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1:
                    accident_possible = True
                    break
            if accident_possible:
                break
    if accident_possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian) for each of the four road parts. It then checks whether an accident is possible based on the traffic light states and prints 'YES' if an accident is possible, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of lines or integers). The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle such errors. Additionally, the function does not validate the range of integers (0 or 1) for the traffic light states, which could lead to incorrect results if non-binary values are provided.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where a pedestrian light is green but none of the incoming lanes are green, and there are no outgoing lanes that could cause an accident. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0
```

In this case, the pedestrian light of part 4 is green, and there is a right lane (part 3) that could potentially lead to part 4. However, the program does not check the incoming lanes for part 4, leading to an incorrect conclusion that no accident is possible. Therefore, the program fails to detect the possibility of an accident in this scenario.
