Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The program correctly reads and stores the traffic light states for each of the four road parts into a list called `traffic_lights`. This part is handled accurately, and the final state of `traffic_lights` after the loop is as described.

2. **Accident Detection Logic**:
   - The program iterates over each of the four road parts and checks if the pedestrian light (`p`) is green.
   - If the pedestrian light is green (`p == 1`), the program then checks if any of the incoming lanes (left, straight, right) are also green (`l == 1` or `s == 1` or `r == 1`). If any of these lanes are green, an accident is possible, and the flag `accident_possible` is set to `True`.
   - If the pedestrian light is green but none of the incoming lanes are green, the program then checks the adjacent road parts for any green incoming lanes. This is done using a loop that checks the lanes of the next three road parts in a counter-clockwise direction (using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list).

3. **Output Determination**:
   - Based on the value of `accident_possible`, the program prints either 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic implemented in the program is correct. It accurately detects the possibility of an accident based on the traffic light states as specified.

**Correctness: **True**
