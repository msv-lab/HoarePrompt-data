Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads. Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l — left, s — straight, r — right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] 

An accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.

Now, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.

Each line contains four integers l, s, r, p — for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.


-----Output-----

On a single line, print "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1

Output
YES

Input
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1

Output
NO

Input
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4.

In the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So, no accident can occur.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian) for each of the four road parts. The possible values for each light are 0 for red and 1 for green.
def func():
    traffic_lights = []
    for _ in range(4):
        traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `traffic_lights` is `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The initial state of `traffic_lights` is an empty list: `[]`.
    #   - The loop runs for a fixed number of times, specified by `range(4)`, meaning it will execute exactly 4 times.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - Each iteration of the loop appends a new list of integers (obtained from `input().split()`) to `traffic_lights`.
    #   - No other variable is mentioned or modified within the loop, so `traffic_lights` is the only variable changing.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - Since the loop runs exactly 4 times, each iteration will append a new list of integers to `traffic_lights`.
    #   - After the first iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers]`.
    #   - After the second iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5]]`.
    #   - After the third iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input]`.
    #   - After the fourth iteration, `traffic_lights` will be `[list_of_integers, [3, 4, 5], user_input, last_user_input]`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The output states provided match the behavior of appending lists in each iteration.
    #   - Since the loop always runs 4 times regardless of the input values, there are no conditions under which the loop does not execute.
    #
    #Therefore, after all 4 executions of the loop, the final state of `traffic_lights` is as described above.
    accident_possible = False
    for i in range(4):
        l, s, r, p = traffic_lights[i]
        
        if p == 1:
            if l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1:
                accident_possible = True
                break
            for j in range(3):
                if traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1:
                    accident_possible = True
                    break
            if accident_possible:
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `traffic_lights` is `[3, 4, 5, ...]`, `accident_possible` is `True`, `i` is `4`, `l` is `...`, `s` is `...`, `r` is `...`, `p` is `...`, `j` is `2` or `3` depending on the iteration that caused the loop to break.
    if accident_possible :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`traffic_lights` remains as a list of integers starting from 3, `accident_possible` is either `True` or `False`, `i` is `4`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, and `j` maintain their respective states depending on the iteration that caused the loop to break. If `accident_possible` is `True`, the console prints 'YES'. If `accident_possible` is `False`, the console prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian) for each of the four road parts. It then checks whether an accident is possible based on the traffic light states and prints 'YES' if an accident is possible, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of lines or integers). The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle such errors. Additionally, the function does not validate the range of integers (0 or 1) for the traffic light states, which could lead to incorrect results if non-binary values are provided.
