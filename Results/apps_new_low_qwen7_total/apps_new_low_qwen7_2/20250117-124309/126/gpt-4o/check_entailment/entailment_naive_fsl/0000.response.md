Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where a pedestrian light is green but none of the incoming lanes are green, and there are no outgoing lanes that could cause an accident. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0
```

In this case, the pedestrian light of part 4 is green, and there is a right lane (part 3) that could potentially lead to part 4. However, the program does not check the incoming lanes for part 4, leading to an incorrect conclusion that no accident is possible. Therefore, the program fails to detect the possibility of an accident in this scenario.
