Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check for potential accidents at the intersection based on the traffic light configurations. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the traffic light states for four road parts, each part having four lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian). It correctly processes this input using a loop and `map` function.
2. **Accident Detection Logic**:
   - For each part, it checks if the pedestrian light (`p`) is green (value 1).
   - If the pedestrian light is green, it checks if any of the other three lights (left, straight, right) are also green.
   - If the pedestrian light is green but none of the other lights are green, it still checks the adjacent parts to see if any of their corresponding lights are green.
3. **Output**: Based on the above checks, it prints 'YES' if an accident is possible and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the execution summary, the program handles the expected inputs and logic correctly, although it does not explicitly handle potential formatting or value range errors in the input. However, the problem statement assumes valid inputs as described, so these edge cases are not a concern in this context.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the specified functionality based on the provided problem description and input format.

Correctness: **True**
