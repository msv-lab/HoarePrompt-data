The function `func` accepts three non-negative integers `t`, `s`, and `x` as input, where \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\). It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. Specifically:
- If `x` is equal to `t`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `x` is greater than `t` and the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `x` is greater than `t`, but the difference between `x` and `t` minus one is divisible by `s` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`, it also prints 'YES'.
- In all other cases, it prints 'NO'.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `x` is exactly `t`, the function correctly prints 'YES'.
- When `x` is greater than `t` and the difference between them is exactly divisible by `s`, the function prints 'YES'.
- When `x` is greater than `t` and the difference minus one is divisible by `s` but `x` is not `t + 1`, the function prints 'YES'.
- For all other cases, including when `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the function prints 'NO'.

There is no return value; instead, the function directly prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions.
