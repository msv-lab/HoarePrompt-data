You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Ted has a pineapple. This pineapple is able to bark like a bulldog! At time t (in seconds) it barks for the first time. Then every s seconds after it, it barks twice with 1 second interval. Thus it barks at times t, t + s, t + s + 1, t + 2s, t + 2s + 1, etc.

Barney woke up in the morning and wants to eat the pineapple, but he can't eat it when it's barking. Barney plans to eat it at time x (in seconds), so he asked you to tell him if it's gonna bark at that time.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains three integers t, s and x (0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the time the pineapple barks for the first time, the pineapple barking interval, and the time Barney wants to eat the pineapple respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single "YES" (without quotes) if the pineapple will bark at time x or a single "NO" (without quotes) otherwise in the only line of output.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 10 4

Output
NO

Input
3 10 3

Output
YES

Input
3 8 51

Output
YES

Input
3 8 52

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first and the second sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 13, 14, ..., so it won't bark at the moment 4 and will bark at the moment 3.

In the third and fourth sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 11, 12, 19, 20, 27, 28, 35, 36, 43, 44, 51, 52, 59, ..., so it will bark at both moments 51 and 52.

- Program:
def func():
    (t, s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    if x == t:
        print('YES')
    elif x > t:
        if (x - t) % s == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif (x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts three non-negative integers `t`, `s`, and `x` as input, where \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\). It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. Specifically:
- If `x` is equal to `t`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `x` is greater than `t` and the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `x` is greater than `t`, but the difference between `x` and `t` minus one is divisible by `s` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`, it also prints 'YES'.
- In all other cases, it prints 'NO'.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `x` is exactly `t`, the function correctly prints 'YES'.
- When `x` is greater than `t` and the difference between them is exactly divisible by `s`, the function prints 'YES'.
- When `x` is greater than `t` and the difference minus one is divisible by `s` but `x` is not `t + 1`, the function prints 'YES'.
- For all other cases, including when `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the function prints 'NO'.

There is no return value; instead, the function directly prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether the pineapple will bark at the specified time `x`. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Case when \( x = t \)**: The program correctly prints "YES" because the pineapple barks at time `t`.
2. **Case when \( x > t \)**:
   - If `(x - t) % s == 0`, it means `x` is at a time when the pineapple would bark normally (at multiples of `s` after `t`).
   - If `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x != t + 1`, it means `x` is exactly one second after a bark time, which is also a valid bark time due to the pineapple barking twice with a one-second interval.
3. **Case when \( x < t \)**: The program correctly prints "NO" because the pineapple hasn’t started barking yet.

Since the program covers all the mentioned cases and handles the conditions correctly, it is correct according to the problem description.
