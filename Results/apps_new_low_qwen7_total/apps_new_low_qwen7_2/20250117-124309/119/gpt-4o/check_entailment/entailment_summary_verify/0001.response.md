### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided function against the problem statement and the given examples to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function correctly reads `t`, `s`, and `x` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Initial Bark Time (`t`):**
   - The function correctly prints 'YES' if `x` is exactly equal to `t`.

3. **Handling Future Bark Times:**
   - The logic checks if `(x - t)` is divisible by `s` or if `(x - t - 1)` is divisible by `s` with the condition `x != t + 1`.
     - If `(x - t) % s == 0`, it means `x` is a time when the pineapple barks directly after an interval.
     - If `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x != t + 1`, it means `x` is a time when the pineapple just finished barking once in the current interval.
   - These conditions cover the two scenarios where the pineapple will bark:
     - At times like `t + s` or `t + s + 1`.
     - At times like `t + 2s` or `t + 2s + 1`, etc.

4. **Handling Past Times:**
   - The function correctly prints 'NO' if `x` is less than `t`.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic when `x` is exactly `t + 1`. The function currently handles this by checking `x != t + 1` before evaluating `(x - t - 1) % s == 0`. This means the function will miss the case where `x = t + 1`, which should be considered a bark time.

To illustrate, let's consider the following example:
- **Example:**
  - Input: `3 10 4`
  - Expected Output: `NO`
  - Actual Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Example:**
  - Input: `3 10 3`
  - Expected Output: `YES`
  - Actual Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Example:**
  - Input: `3 10 4`
  - Expected Output: `NO`
  - Actual Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Example:**
  - Input: `3 10 13`
  - Expected Output: `YES`
  - Actual Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Example:**
  - Input: `3 10 4`
  - Expected Output: `NO`
  - Actual Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Example:**
  - Input: `3 10 4`
  - Expected Output: `NO`
  - Actual Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Example:**
  - Input: `3 8 51`
  - Expected Output: `YES`
  - Actual Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Example:**
  - Input: `3 8 52`
  - Expected Output: `YES`
  - Actual Output: `YES` (Correct)

The function works correctly in most cases, but it fails to account for the case where `x = t + 1`. This specific case should be handled separately or included in the logic.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment missed the edge case where `x = t + 1`. Therefore, the function is not entirely correct as it does not handle this specific scenario.

**Final: False**
