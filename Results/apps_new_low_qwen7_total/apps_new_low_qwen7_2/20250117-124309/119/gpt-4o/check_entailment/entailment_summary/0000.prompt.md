Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Ted has a pineapple. This pineapple is able to bark like a bulldog! At time t (in seconds) it barks for the first time. Then every s seconds after it, it barks twice with 1 second interval. Thus it barks at times t, t + s, t + s + 1, t + 2s, t + 2s + 1, etc.

Barney woke up in the morning and wants to eat the pineapple, but he can't eat it when it's barking. Barney plans to eat it at time x (in seconds), so he asked you to tell him if it's gonna bark at that time.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains three integers t, s and x (0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the time the pineapple barks for the first time, the pineapple barking interval, and the time Barney wants to eat the pineapple respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single "YES" (without quotes) if the pineapple will bark at time x or a single "NO" (without quotes) otherwise in the only line of output.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 10 4

Output
NO

Input
3 10 3

Output
YES

Input
3 8 51

Output
YES

Input
3 8 52

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first and the second sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 13, 14, ..., so it won't bark at the moment 4 and will bark at the moment 3.

In the third and fourth sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 11, 12, 19, 20, 27, 28, 35, 36, 43, 44, 51, 52, 59, ..., so it will bark at both moments 51 and 52.

# Program:
def func():
    (t, s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    if x == t:
        print('YES')
    elif x > t:
        if (x - t) % s == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif (x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` accepts three non-negative integers `t`, `s`, and `x` as input, where \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\). It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. Specifically:
- If `x` is equal to `t`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `x` is greater than `t` and the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `x` is greater than `t`, but the difference between `x` and `t` minus one is divisible by `s` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`, it also prints 'YES'.
- In all other cases, it prints 'NO'.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `x` is exactly `t`, the function correctly prints 'YES'.
- When `x` is greater than `t` and the difference between them is exactly divisible by `s`, the function prints 'YES'.
- When `x` is greater than `t` and the difference minus one is divisible by `s` but `x` is not `t + 1`, the function prints 'YES'.
- For all other cases, including when `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the function prints 'NO'.

There is no return value; instead, the function directly prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions.
