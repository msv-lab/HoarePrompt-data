### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if the pineapple will bark at a specific time `x` based on the initial bark time `t` and the interval `s`. Let's analyze the logic of the provided function:

1. **Reading Input:** The function correctly reads three integers `t`, `s`, and `x` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Checking Initial Bark Time (`t`):**
   - If `x` is exactly equal to `t`, it prints 'YES', which is correct because the pineapple barks at time `t`.

3. **Handling Future Bark Times:**
   - If `x` is greater than `t`, the function checks if `(x - t)` is divisible by `s` or if `(x - t - 1)` is divisible by `s` (with a special condition to handle `x` not being `t + 1`).
     - `(x - t) % s == 0` would mean `x` is a time when the pineapple barks directly after an interval.
     - `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` would mean `x` is a time when the pineapple just finished barking once in the current interval.
   - The special condition `x != t + 1` ensures we don't mistakenly consider the case where `x` is immediately after `t` but not part of any interval pattern.

4. **Handling Past Times:**
   - If `x` is less than `t`, the function correctly prints 'NO' since the pineapple hasn't started barking yet.

The logic handles all edge cases appropriately, including the exact start time `t`, the immediate post-start time `t+1`, and general future times considering the interval `s`.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program correctly determines whether the pineapple will bark at time `x` based on the provided conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
