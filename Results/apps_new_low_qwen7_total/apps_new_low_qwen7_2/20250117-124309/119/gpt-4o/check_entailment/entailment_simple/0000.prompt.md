Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Ted has a pineapple. This pineapple is able to bark like a bulldog! At time t (in seconds) it barks for the first time. Then every s seconds after it, it barks twice with 1 second interval. Thus it barks at times t, t + s, t + s + 1, t + 2s, t + 2s + 1, etc.

Barney woke up in the morning and wants to eat the pineapple, but he can't eat it when it's barking. Barney plans to eat it at time x (in seconds), so he asked you to tell him if it's gonna bark at that time.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains three integers t, s and x (0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the time the pineapple barks for the first time, the pineapple barking interval, and the time Barney wants to eat the pineapple respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single "YES" (without quotes) if the pineapple will bark at time x or a single "NO" (without quotes) otherwise in the only line of output.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 10 4

Output
NO

Input
3 10 3

Output
YES

Input
3 8 51

Output
YES

Input
3 8 52

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first and the second sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 13, 14, ..., so it won't bark at the moment 4 and will bark at the moment 3.

In the third and fourth sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 11, 12, 19, 20, 27, 28, 35, 36, 43, 44, 51, 52, 59, ..., so it will bark at both moments 51 and 52.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t, s, and x are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t, s, x = map(int, input().split())
    if (x == t) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        if (x > t) :
            if ((x - t) % s == 0) :
                print('YES')
            else :
                if ((x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1) :
                    print('YES')
                else :
                    print('NO')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input. `x` is greater than `t`. If `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x != t + 1`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input. `x` is greater than `t`. If the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x != t + 1`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input (with `x` not equal to `t`). If `x` is greater than `t`, the output is 'YES' under two conditions: when the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, or when `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`. If `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the output remains the same as per the else condition where the output is 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input. If `x` equals `t`, the program does not change the output. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than `t`, the output is 'YES' if the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, or if `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`. If `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the output remains 'NO'.
