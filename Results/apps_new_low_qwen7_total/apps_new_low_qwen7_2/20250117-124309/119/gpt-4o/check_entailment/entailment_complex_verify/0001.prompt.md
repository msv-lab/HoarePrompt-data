You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Ted has a pineapple. This pineapple is able to bark like a bulldog! At time t (in seconds) it barks for the first time. Then every s seconds after it, it barks twice with 1 second interval. Thus it barks at times t, t + s, t + s + 1, t + 2s, t + 2s + 1, etc.

Barney woke up in the morning and wants to eat the pineapple, but he can't eat it when it's barking. Barney plans to eat it at time x (in seconds), so he asked you to tell him if it's gonna bark at that time.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains three integers t, s and x (0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the time the pineapple barks for the first time, the pineapple barking interval, and the time Barney wants to eat the pineapple respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single "YES" (without quotes) if the pineapple will bark at time x or a single "NO" (without quotes) otherwise in the only line of output.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 10 4

Output
NO

Input
3 10 3

Output
YES

Input
3 8 51

Output
YES

Input
3 8 52

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first and the second sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 13, 14, ..., so it won't bark at the moment 4 and will bark at the moment 3.

In the third and fourth sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 11, 12, 19, 20, 27, 28, 35, 36, 43, 44, 51, 52, 59, ..., so it will bark at both moments 51 and 52.

- Program: 
def func():
    (t, s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    if x == t:
        print('YES')
    elif x > t:
        if (x - t) % s == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif (x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t, s, and x are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t, s, x = map(int, input().split())
    if (x == t) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        if (x > t) :

                if ((x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1) :
                    print('YES')
                else :
                    print('NO')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input. `x` is greater than `t`. If `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x != t + 1`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input. `x` is greater than `t`. If the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x != t + 1`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input (with `x` not equal to `t`). If `x` is greater than `t`, the output is 'YES' under two conditions: when the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, or when `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`. If `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the output remains the same as per the else condition where the output is 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input. If `x` equals `t`, the program does not change the output. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than `t`, the output is 'YES' if the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, or if `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`. If `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the output remains 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts three non-negative integers `t`, `s`, and `x` as input, where \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\). It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. Specifically:
- If `x` is equal to `t`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `x` is greater than `t` and the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `x` is greater than `t`, but the difference between `x` and `t` minus one is divisible by `s` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`, it also prints 'YES'.
- In all other cases, it prints 'NO'.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `x` is exactly `t`, the function correctly prints 'YES'.
- When `x` is greater than `t` and the difference between them is exactly divisible by `s`, the function prints 'YES'.
- When `x` is greater than `t` and the difference minus one is divisible by `s` but `x` is not `t + 1`, the function prints 'YES'.
- For all other cases, including when `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the function prints 'NO'.

There is no return value; instead, the function directly prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if the pineapple will bark at a specific time `x` based on the initial bark time `t` and the interval `s`. Let's analyze the logic of the provided function:

1. **Reading Input:** The function correctly reads three integers `t`, `s`, and `x` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Checking Initial Bark Time (`t`):**
   - If `x` is exactly equal to `t`, it prints 'YES', which is correct because the pineapple barks at time `t`.

3. **Handling Future Bark Times:**
   - If `x` is greater than `t`, the function checks if `(x - t)` is divisible by `s` or if `(x - t - 1)` is divisible by `s` (with a special condition to handle `x` not being `t + 1`).
     - `(x - t) % s == 0` would mean `x` is a time when the pineapple barks directly after an interval.
     - `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` would mean `x` is a time when the pineapple just finished barking once in the current interval.
   - The special condition `x != t + 1` ensures we don't mistakenly consider the case where `x` is immediately after `t` but not part of any interval pattern.

4. **Handling Past Times:**
   - If `x` is less than `t`, the function correctly prints 'NO' since the pineapple hasn't started barking yet.

The logic handles all edge cases appropriately, including the exact start time `t`, the immediate post-start time `t+1`, and general future times considering the interval `s`.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program correctly determines whether the pineapple will bark at time `x` based on the provided conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
