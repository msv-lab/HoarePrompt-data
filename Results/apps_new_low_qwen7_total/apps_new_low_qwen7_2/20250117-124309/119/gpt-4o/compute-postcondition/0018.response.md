The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `s`, and `x`. These parameters are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\). 

Case_1: The function returns an integer value based on some condition involving `t`, `s`, and `x`.
Case_2: The function returns an integer value based on another condition involving `t`, `s`, and `x`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three parameters `t`, `s`, and `x`, and based on certain conditions, return an integer value.
