The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `s`, and `x`. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input, and the value of `x` is equal to the value of `t`.**
