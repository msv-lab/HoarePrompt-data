The code `t, s, x = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `t`, `s`, and `x`. Since the input values are not specified, we will represent them generically as `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively, where `0 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^9` and `2 ≤ b ≤ 10^9`.

Given the initial conditions: `t`, `s`, and `x` are non-negative integers such that `0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9` and `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9`.

After executing the code, the values of `t`, `s`, and `x` are updated based on the input. The initial values of `t` and `x` are replaced by the first and third integers in the input, while `s` is replaced by the second integer in the input.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input.**
