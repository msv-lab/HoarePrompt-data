Postcondition: ***`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input. `x` is greater than `t`. If the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x != t + 1`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
