Postcondition: ***`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input. If `x` equals `t`, the program does not change the output. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than `t`, the output is 'YES' if the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, or if `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`. If `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the output remains 'NO'.***
