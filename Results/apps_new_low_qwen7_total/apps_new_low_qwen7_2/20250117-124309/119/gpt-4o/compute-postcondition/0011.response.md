The code prints 'NO', which does not assign any new values to the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged. The precondition that `(x - t) % s != 0` and either `(x - t - 1) % s != 0` is false or `x == t + 1` also remains valid.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input. `x` is greater than `t`. `(x - t) % s != 0`, and either `(x - t - 1) % s != 0` is false or `x == t + 1`. The output is 'NO'.**
