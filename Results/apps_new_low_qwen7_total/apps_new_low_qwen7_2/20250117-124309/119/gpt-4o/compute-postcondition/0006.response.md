The code `print('YES')` does not modify any of the existing variables (`t`, `s`, `x`). It simply prints the string 'YES'. Since the variables `t`, `s`, and `x` are unaffected by this print statement, they retain their initial conditions. The only new information provided by the code is the printed string 'YES', which is part of the output but not a variable value.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input. `x` is greater than `t`. The difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s` (i.e., `(x - t) % s == 0`); printed output is 'YES'**
