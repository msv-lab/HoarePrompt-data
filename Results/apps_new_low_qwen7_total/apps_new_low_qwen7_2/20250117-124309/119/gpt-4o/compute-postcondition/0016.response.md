Postcondition: ***`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input (with `x` not equal to `t`). If `x` is greater than `t`, the output is 'YES' under two conditions: when the difference between `x` and `t` is divisible by `s`, or when `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`. If `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the output remains the same as per the else condition where the output is 'NO'.***
