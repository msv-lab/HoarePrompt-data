The code snippet simply prints 'YES' and does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `s`, and `x`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged after executing the print statement.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer in the input, `s` is the second integer in the input, and `x` is the third integer in the input. `x` is greater than `t`. `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x != t + 1; printed value is 'YES'**
