Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is the string `t` without its last two characters. If `s + t[-i:] == t`, then the function prints 'YES\n' followed by the string `t` without its last two characters. Otherwise, the function does nothing.***
