The code `s = t[:-i]` assigns a new value to `s`. The slice `t[:-i]` extracts the substring from the beginning of `t` up to (but not including) the character at index `-i`. Given the precondition that the substring from the start to index `i` is equal to the substring from the end to index `-i`, this means `t[:i] == t[-i:]`.

Since `s` is now set to this slice, the value of `s` will be `t[:i]` because `t[:i]` and `t[-i:]` are the same. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is the substring `t[:i]`**
