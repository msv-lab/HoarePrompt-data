Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The loop iterates `n-1` times. During each iteration, it checks if the prefix `t[:i]` is equal to the suffix `t[-i:]`. If this condition is met for any `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the function prints 'YES\n' followed by the string `t` excluding the matching suffix and returns. If no such `i` exists, the function does not print anything and returns `None`.**

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: `t` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `t[:i]` equals `t[-i:]`.
   - If this condition is true, it sets `s = t[:-i]` and checks if `s + t[-i:] == t`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES\n' followed by `s` and returns, effectively terminating the function.

3. **Variables and Invariants**:
   - `t` remains unchanged unless the function returns early with a modified string `s`.
   - `i` increments with each iteration but is not returned or modified outside the loop.
   - The loop does not modify `n` or create new variables that persist beyond the loop.

4. **Final State**:
   - If the condition `t[:i] == t[-i:]` is ever true for any `i` during the loop, the function will print 'YES\n' followed by `t` minus the matched suffix and return.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such `i`, the function returns `None` without modifying `t`.

Thus, the final output state is determined by whether the loop finds a suitable `i` during its execution.
