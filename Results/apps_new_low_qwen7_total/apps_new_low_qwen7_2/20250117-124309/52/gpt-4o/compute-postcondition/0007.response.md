Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. If the substring `t[:i]` is equal to the suffix `t[-i:]`, the condition is false, hence `t` remains unchanged. Given the precondition that `n` must be greater than 1, this condition always holds since no value of `i` would make the substring and suffix equal for a valid `n > 1`. Therefore, the postcondition is the same as the precondition: `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.***
