Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. If the first two characters of `t` match the last two characters of `t`, the function prints 'YES\n' followed by the string `t` without its last two characters. Otherwise, the function does nothing.***
