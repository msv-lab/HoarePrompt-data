Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - Since `i` is initially set to 2, the loop condition `1 <= i < n` is checked.
   - If `i == 2`, the loop condition is satisfied, and the loop body would execute. However, since the loop body is omitted, no changes are made inside the loop itself.
   - After this iteration, `i` is incremented to 3 (i.e., `i += 1`).

4. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute again if it satisfies the condition `1 <= i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` should be 3.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 1.**
