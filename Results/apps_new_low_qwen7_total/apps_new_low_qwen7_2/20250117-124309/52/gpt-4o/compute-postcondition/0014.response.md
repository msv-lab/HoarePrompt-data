`s` is assigned the value of `t` sliced from the beginning to the end excluding the last `i` characters. The values of `t` and `i` are not specified in the initial state, so we will keep them as they are.

Output State: **`s` is `t` sliced from the beginning to the end excluding the last `i` characters, `t` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged.**
