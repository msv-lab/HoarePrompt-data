Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- The condition in the loop checks if the substring `t[:i]` is equal to the suffix `t[-i:]`.
- Since `n` must be greater than 1, the loop will run from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.

### Loop Head
- The loop variable is `i`.
- The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `n-1`.

### Analysis
- At the end of each iteration, the value of `i` increases by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration
- Assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration.
- Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

### Updated State
- The string `t` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.

### Conclusion
Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, the next value of `i` should be `2` if it was `1` in the previous iteration, and so on.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**.

If the loop just finished its first iteration (i.e., `i` was 1), then the next value of `i` should be 2. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**.
