`s` is assigned the value of `t[:-i]`. Since `i` is 2, this means `s` will be the string `t` without its last two characters. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1; `s` is the string `t` without its last two characters.

Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1; `s` is the string `t` without its last two characters.**
