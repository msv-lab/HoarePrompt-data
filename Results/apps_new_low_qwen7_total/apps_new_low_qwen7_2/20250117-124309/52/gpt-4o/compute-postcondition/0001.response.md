To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- The length of `t` is `n`, where `n` is an integer representing the length of `t`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(1, n)`.
   - This means `i` will take values from 1 up to but not including `n`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be the smallest value in the range, which is 1.
   - Additionally, the condition `1 < n` must be satisfied because the range `range(1, n)` requires the upper limit to be greater than the lower limit (which is 1).

3. **Initial State:**
   - From the problem statement, we know `t` is a non-empty string, so `n` (the length of `t`) must be at least 1. However, since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at all.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

### Final State:
- `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- The length of `t` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state must be:

**State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` must be greater than 1**
