Reasoning:
The provided program seems to follow the problem's requirements correctly. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input string `t` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace, which is necessary for processing the string.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through each possible suffix length from 1 to the length of `t` minus 1.
   - For each suffix length `i`, it checks if the prefix of `t` (of length `n-i`) is equal to the suffix of `t` (of length `i`).
   - If such a matching prefix-suffix pair is found, it means the string `t` can be split into a prefix `s` and a suffix `t[-i:]` such that `s + t[-i:] == t`. In this case, the function returns `'YES\n' + s`.
   - If no such `i` is found, the function checks if removing the last two characters of `t` (i.e., `t[:-2]`) results in a string that matches the original `t` when the last character is removed (i.e., `t[:-2] + t[-1] == t`). This condition would only be true if `t` ends with the same two characters repeated.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function returns `'NO'`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where `t` might be a simple repetition of a smaller substring (e.g., "abcabc").
   - It also correctly identifies strings that cannot be split in the required manner (e.g., "tatbt").

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The function formats the output as required, printing 'YES' followed by the substring `s` if an error condition is met, or 'NO' otherwise.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program appears to correctly identify whether the given string `t` could have resulted from a network error and outputs the correct response.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is verified as **True**.
