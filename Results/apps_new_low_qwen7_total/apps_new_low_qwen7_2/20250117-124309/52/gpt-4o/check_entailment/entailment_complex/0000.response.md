Reasoning:

The function `func_1` aims to determine if the given string `t` can be formed by merging two identical messages with a possible overlap due to transmission errors. The function correctly implements the logic to check if such an overlap exists. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The function starts by validating that `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and its length does not exceed 100 characters. This is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Loop Through Possible Overlaps**: The function iterates through possible overlaps starting from 1 to `n-1` characters, checking if the prefix of length `i` is equal to the suffix of length `i`. If such an overlap is found, it extracts the prefix (`s = t[:-i]`) and checks if appending the suffix to `s` gives back the original string `t`. If so, it returns 'YES' followed by the extracted prefix.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function also handles the edge case where the last two characters of `t` might form a valid overlap. However, this specific case is not strictly necessary since the general loop already covers all possible overlaps up to `n-1`.

4. **Return 'NO' if No Overlap Found**: If no such overlap is found during the loop, the function returns 'NO', indicating that the string cannot be formed by the described error mechanism.

Given these points, the function correctly identifies whether the input string can be the result of the described transmission error and provides the correct output format as specified in the problem statement.
