The code simply prints 'Yes', which does not affect the values of any variables. The print statement itself does not change the state of the variables. The precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 1,000,000, `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 1,000,000, `deficit_blue`, `deficit_violet`, and `deficit_orange` are non-negative integers, `extra_blue`, `extra_violet`, and `extra_orange` are non-negative integers, `extra_spheres` is a non-negative integer, `total_deficit` is a non-negative integer, and 'Yes' is printed.**
