The function takes six non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as input and determines whether it is possible to exchange spheres between two groups such that both groups end up with the same number of blue, violet, and orange spheres. If it is possible, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After executing, the program state will show the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) unchanged, along with the calculation of deficits and excesses in the respective colors. If the total excess spheres are enough to cover the total deficits, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'.
