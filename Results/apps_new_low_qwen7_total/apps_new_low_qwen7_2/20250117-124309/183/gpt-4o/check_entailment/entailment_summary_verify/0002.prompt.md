You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Carl is a beginner magician. He has a blue, b violet and c orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least x blue, y violet and z orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b and c (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that are in the magician's disposal.

The second line of the input contains three integers, x, y and z (0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that he needs to get.


-----Output-----

If the wizard is able to obtain the required numbers of spheres, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4 0
2 1 2

Output
Yes

Input
5 6 1
2 7 2

Output
No

Input
3 3 3
2 2 2

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample the wizard has 4 blue and 4 violet spheres. In his first action he can turn two blue spheres into one violet one. After that he will have 2 blue and 5 violet spheres. Then he turns 4 violet spheres into 2 orange spheres and he ends up with 2 blue, 1 violet and 2 orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.

- Program:
def func():
    (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    deficit_blue = max(0, x - a)
    deficit_violet = max(0, y - b)
    deficit_orange = max(0, z - c)
    extra_blue = max(0, a - x)
    extra_violet = max(0, b - y)
    extra_orange = max(0, c - z)
    extra_spheres = extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2
    total_deficit = deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange
    if extra_spheres >= total_deficit:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function takes six non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as input and determines whether it is possible to exchange spheres between two groups such that both groups end up with the same number of blue, violet, and orange spheres. If it is possible, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After executing, the program state will show the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) unchanged, along with the calculation of deficits and excesses in the respective colors. If the total excess spheres are enough to cover the total deficits, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Carl needs to obtain specific numbers of blue, violet, and orange spheres.
   - He can perform transformations where two spheres of the same color can be turned into one sphere of any other color.
   - The goal is to check if it is possible for Carl to end up with the required number of each type of sphere.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the initial and target number of spheres from the input.
   - It calculates the deficit for each color (i.e., the difference between the required and available number of spheres).
   - It also calculates the excess number of spheres that can be used for transformation.
   - The key logic checks if the total excess spheres are sufficient to cover the total deficit.

3. **Key Points in the Code:**
   - `deficit_blue`, `deficit_violet`, `deficit_orange` are calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between the required and available spheres.
   - `extra_blue`, `extra_violet`, `extra_orange` are calculated similarly but represent the excess spheres.
   - The total excess spheres are calculated by summing `extra_blue // 2`, `extra_violet // 2`, and `extra_orange // 2`. This accounts for the fact that each transformation reduces the count by 1 from the original color and increases another color by 1.
   - The total deficit is the sum of the deficits for each color.
   - If the total excess spheres are greater than or equal to the total deficit, it means Carl can achieve the required number of spheres through transformations.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles cases where the required number of spheres is less than or equal to the available number of spheres.
   - It correctly accounts for the possibility of having negative values (though they are not used in the final logic).

Given this analysis, the code accurately determines whether Carl can obtain the required number of spheres through the allowed transformations.
