You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Carl is a beginner magician. He has a blue, b violet and c orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least x blue, y violet and z orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b and c (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that are in the magician's disposal.

The second line of the input contains three integers, x, y and z (0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that he needs to get.


-----Output-----

If the wizard is able to obtain the required numbers of spheres, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4 0
2 1 2

Output
Yes

Input
5 6 1
2 7 2

Output
No

Input
3 3 3
2 2 2

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample the wizard has 4 blue and 4 violet spheres. In his first action he can turn two blue spheres into one violet one. After that he will have 2 blue and 5 violet spheres. Then he turns 4 violet spheres into 2 orange spheres and he ends up with 2 blue, 1 violet and 2 orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.

def func():
    (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    deficit_blue = max(0, x - a)
    deficit_violet = max(0, y - b)
    deficit_orange = max(0, z - c)
    extra_blue = max(0, a - x)
    extra_violet = max(0, b - y)
    extra_orange = max(0, c - z)
    extra_spheres = extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2
    total_deficit = deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange
    if extra_spheres >= total_deficit:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1,000,000, and x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1,000,000.

    if (extra_spheres >= total_deficit) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 1,000,000, `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 1,000,000, `deficit_blue`, `deficit_violet`, and `deficit_orange` are non-negative integers, `extra_blue`, `extra_violet`, and `extra_orange` are non-negative integers, `extra_spheres` is a non-negative integer, `total_deficit` is a non-negative integer, and either 'Yes' is printed if `extra_spheres` is greater than or equal to `total_deficit`, or 'No' is printed if `extra_spheres` is less than `total_deficit`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the transformation rules of the spheres. According to the problem description, in one move, Carl can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of extra spheres available for transformation and does not properly account for the transformation process.

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input
5 5 5
3 3 3
```

The correct approach would be to transform pairs of the same color to get the needed colors. Here, Carl can transform 2 blue and 2 violet spheres each into 1 orange sphere, and then transform 2 orange spheres into 1 blue sphere. This way, he can achieve the desired configuration. However, the given program does not implement this logic and instead checks if the sum of extra spheres is enough to cover the total deficit, which is not a valid transformation rule as per the problem description.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
