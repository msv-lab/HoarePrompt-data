Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Carl is a beginner magician. He has a blue, b violet and c orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least x blue, y violet and z orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b and c (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that are in the magician's disposal.

The second line of the input contains three integers, x, y and z (0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that he needs to get.


-----Output-----

If the wizard is able to obtain the required numbers of spheres, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4 0
2 1 2

Output
Yes

Input
5 6 1
2 7 2

Output
No

Input
3 3 3
2 2 2

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample the wizard has 4 blue and 4 violet spheres. In his first action he can turn two blue spheres into one violet one. After that he will have 2 blue and 5 violet spheres. Then he turns 4 violet spheres into 2 orange spheres and he ends up with 2 blue, 1 violet and 2 orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1,000,000, and x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1,000,000.
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

x, y, z = map(int, input().split())

deficit_blue = max(0, x - a)

deficit_violet = max(0, y - b)

deficit_orange = max(0, z - c)

extra_blue = max(0, a - x)

extra_violet = max(0, b - y)

extra_orange = max(0, c - z)

extra_spheres = extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2

total_deficit = deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange
    if (extra_spheres >= total_deficit) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 1,000,000, `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 1,000,000, `deficit_blue`, `deficit_violet`, and `deficit_orange` are non-negative integers, `extra_blue`, `extra_violet`, and `extra_orange` are non-negative integers, `extra_spheres` is a non-negative integer, `total_deficit` is a non-negative integer, and either 'Yes' is printed if `extra_spheres` is greater than or equal to `total_deficit`, or 'No' is printed if `extra_spheres` is less than `total_deficit`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes six non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as input and determines whether it is possible to exchange spheres between two groups such that both groups end up with the same number of blue, violet, and orange spheres. If it is possible, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After executing, the program state will show the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) unchanged, along with the calculation of deficits and excesses in the respective colors. If the total excess spheres are enough to cover the total deficits, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'.
