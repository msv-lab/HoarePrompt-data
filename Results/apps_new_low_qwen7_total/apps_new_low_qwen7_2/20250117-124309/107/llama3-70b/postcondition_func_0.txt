The function reads four positive integers \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), \(a\), and \(b\) from standard input, where \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \times m \times k\) with \(a \neq b\). It calculates the minimum time required for two entities to meet, considering both block and floor traversal times. Specifically, it computes the time to traverse between the blocks containing \(a\) and \(b\) and the time to traverse between the floors within those blocks. The function then prints the total time required for the entities to meet. The function does not return any value.
