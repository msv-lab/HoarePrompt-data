The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the definition `def func():`. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on certain conditions, but the specific conditions and return values are not detailed in the given output.

Given the constraints and relationships for the parameters (which do not actually appear as parameters in the function definition), the function's behavior can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on certain conditions related to positive integers n, m, k, a, and b, where 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k and a != b.**
