Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `a_floor` is a positive integer, `a_block` is calculated based on `a`, `b_floor` is a positive integer, `b_block` is calculated based on `b`, `min_block_time` is calculated based on `a` and `b`. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Otherwise, `min_floor_time` is `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, and `min_block_time` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
