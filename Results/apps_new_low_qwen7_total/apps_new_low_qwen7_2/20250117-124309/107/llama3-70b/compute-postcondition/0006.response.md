The code simply calculates and prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`. Since `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` are already determined based on the initial conditions and do not change within this code snippet, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, and `min_block_time` remain unchanged.

The calculation of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` is based on the given conditions:

- If `a_floor` > `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` = `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`.
- Otherwise, `min_floor_time` = `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.

After the print statement, these values are summed and printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `a_floor` is a positive integer, `a_block` is calculated based on `a`, `b_floor` is a positive integer, `b_block` is calculated based on `b`, `min_block_time` is calculated based on `a` and `b`, `min_floor_time` is either `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` if `a_floor` > `b_floor` or `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10` otherwise, and the output of the print statement is `min_block_time + min_floor_time`.**
