Functionality: **The function reads four positive integers \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), \(a\), and \(b\) from standard input, where \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \times m \times k\) with \(a \neq b\). It calculates the minimum time required for two entities to meet, considering both block and floor traversal times. Specifically, it computes the time to traverse between the blocks containing \(a\) and \(b\) and the time to traverse between the floors within those blocks. The function then prints the total time required for the entities to meet. The function does not return any value.**

- The function starts by reading \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) from input and stores them in variables.
- It then reads \(a\) and \(b\) from input and stores them in variables.
- It calculates the floor and block indices for both \(a\) and \(b\).
- It determines the minimum block traversal time, which is based on the absolute difference between the block indices of \(a\) and \(b\).
- It calculates the minimum floor traversal time based on whether the floor index of \(a\) is greater than that of \(b\).
- Finally, it prints the sum of the minimum block and floor traversal times.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If \(a\) and \(b\) are in the same block but different floors, the block traversal time would be zero.
- If \(a\) and \(b\) are in the same floor but different blocks, the floor traversal time would be zero.
- If \(a\) and \(b\) are in the same block and the same floor, both the block and floor traversal times would be zero, resulting in a total time of zero.

Missing Functionality:
- The code does not handle the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are in the same floor and the same block but at different positions. This would require additional calculations to determine the exact position-based traversal time, which is not covered in the current implementation.
