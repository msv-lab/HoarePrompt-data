Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Variable Calculation**:
   - The program correctly reads \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), \(a\), and \(b\) from the input.
   - It then calculates the floor and block numbers for both apartments \(a\) and \(b\). This is done using the formulas:
     - `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1` to get the floor number for apartment \(a\).
     - `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` to get the block number for apartment \(a\).
     - Similarly for apartment \(b\).

2. **Block Traversal Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum time to travel between the blocks of apartments \(a\) and \(b\):
     - `min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`
     - This formula considers the circular nature of the building, ensuring that the minimum path is taken either directly or by going around the building.

3. **Floor Traversal Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the minimum time to travel between the floors of the blocks:
     - If `a_floor > b_floor`, it calculates `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` to account for moving up.
     - If `a_floor <= b_floor`, it calculates `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10` to account for moving down.
     - Adding 10 seconds accounts for the elevator ride which takes 10 seconds plus 1 second per floor change.

4. **Total Time Calculation**:
   - The program sums the block traversal time and the floor traversal time to get the total time required for the journey.
   - Finally, it prints the total time.

Given the detailed step-by-step breakdown, the logic appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program should work as intended for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
