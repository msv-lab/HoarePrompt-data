Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The program correctly reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` from the standard input.
   - This part is accurate and correctly follows the problem requirements.

2. **Calculating Floors and Blocks**:
   - The program correctly computes the floor and block numbers for both apartments using modulo and integer division operations.
   - This is crucial for determining the distance between the two apartments.
   - Specifically:
     - `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1` calculates the floor of apartment `a`.
     - `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` calculates the block of apartment `a`.
     - Similar calculations are done for `b_floor` and `b_block`.

3. **Minimum Block Transition Time**:
   - The program calculates the minimum time required to transition between blocks using the formula `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.
   - This formula correctly accounts for the shortest path either directly or by going around the building.
   - If `a_block` and `b_block` are on opposite sides of the building, the formula `n - abs(a_block - b_block)` accounts for the round trip.

4. **Minimum Floor Transition Time**:
   - The program calculates the minimum time required to move between floors within the same block using the formula `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` if `a_floor > b_floor`, otherwise `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.
   - This formula correctly accounts for the elevator ride time plus the walking time if necessary.
   - Note that the addition of 10 seconds accounts for the waiting time at the elevator and the time to board the elevator.

5. **Output**:
   - The program adds the minimum block transition time and the minimum floor transition time to get the total minimum time.
   - This part is correctly implemented.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases like moving from one side of the building to the other effectively using the `min` function for block transitions and simple arithmetic for floor transitions.

### Test Cases Analysis:
- The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program. The logic appears sound and matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and the provided function summary, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
