Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility that Edward and Natasha might live in the same block but different floors. In such a scenario, the program would incorrectly calculate the time based on moving between blocks instead of just moving within the same block.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 10 5
15 15
```
Here, both Edward and Natasha live in the same apartment (15th apartment on the first floor). According to the problem description, the minimum time should be 0 because they are already in the same place. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the time based on moving between blocks, which will result in a non-zero value.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where Edward and Natasha live in the same block but different floors. The correct approach would be to calculate the absolute difference in floors and add the necessary time for moving between floors, regardless of whether they are in the same block or not.
