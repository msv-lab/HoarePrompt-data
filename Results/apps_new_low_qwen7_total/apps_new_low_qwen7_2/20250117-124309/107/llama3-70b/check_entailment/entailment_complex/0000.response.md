Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The function correctly reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), \( a \), and \( b \) from the input.
2. **Calculating Floor and Block Indices**: 
   - The floor indices (\(a\_floor\) and \(b\_floor\)) are correctly calculated as \((a - 1) \% m + 1\) and \((b - 1) \% m + 1\).
   - The block indices (\(a\_block\) and \(b\_block\)) are correctly calculated as \((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1\) and \((b - 1) // (m * k) + 1\).
3. **Block Traversal Time Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `min_block_time` is correct. It accounts for the minimum time to travel between the blocks containing \(a\) and \(b\).
4. **Floor Traversal Time Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `min_floor_time` is correct. It accounts for the time to travel between the floors within the same block. However, there is an error in the logic here. The formula should be:
     ```python
     min_floor_time = abs(a_floor - b_floor) * 5
     ```
     The current implementation includes an unnecessary constant term `+10`, which should not be added unless explicitly stated.
5. **Total Time Calculation**:
   - The total time is correctly calculated as the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.

Given these points, the main issue is in the `min_floor_time` calculation. The function incorrectly adds `10` seconds to the absolute difference of the floor indices, which is not aligned with the problem statement. 

Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

    a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
    a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1

    b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
    b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1

    min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15

    min_floor_time = abs(a_floor - b_floor) * 5

    print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
```

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False** due to the incorrect calculation of `min_floor_time`.
