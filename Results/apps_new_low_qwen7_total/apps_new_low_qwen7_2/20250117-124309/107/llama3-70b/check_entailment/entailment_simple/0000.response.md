### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by two more integers `a` and `b` from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Floor and Block Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates `a_floor` and `a_block` correctly for apartment `a` as:
     \[
     \text{a\_floor} = (\text{a} - 1) \% m + 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{a\_block} = (\text{a} - 1) // (\text{m} \times \text{k}) + 1
     \]
   - Similarly, it calculates `b_floor` and `b_block` for apartment `b` correctly.

3. **Block Time Calculation**:
   - The program correctly computes the minimum time to move between blocks (`min_block_time`) as:
     \[
     \text{min\_block\_time} = \min(|\text{a\_block} - \text{b\_block}|, n - |\text{a\_block} - \text{b\_block}|) \times 15
     \]

4. **Floor Time Calculation**:
   - The program checks whether `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor` to compute `min_floor_time`:
     \[
     \text{if } (\text{a\_floor} > \text{b\_floor}), \text{min\_floor\_time} = (\text{a\_floor} - \text{b\_floor}) \times 5 + 10
     \]
     \[
     \text{else}, \text{min\_floor\_time} = (\text{b\_floor} - \text{a\_floor}) \times 5 + 10
     \]
   - This logic is implemented correctly.

5. **Output**: The program sums up `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` and prints the result, which is the total minimum time required to travel from apartment `a` to apartment `b`.

Given the above points, the program logic and calculations align with the problem statement and examples provided. Therefore, the program should work as intended for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
