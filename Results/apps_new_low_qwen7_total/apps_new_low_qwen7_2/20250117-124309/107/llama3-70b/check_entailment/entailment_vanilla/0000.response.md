### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment given their apartment numbers and the structure of the building.

#### Key Components:
1. **Input Processing**:
   - The program correctly extracts the number of floors (`n`), number of apartments per floor (`m`), and number of flats per apartment (`k`) from the first line.
   - It also correctly extracts the apartment numbers `a` and `b` from the second line.

2. **Calculating Floors and Blocks**:
   - The program correctly computes the floor and block numbers for both apartments using modulo and integer division operations.
   - This is crucial for determining the distance between the two apartments.

3. **Minimum Block Transition Time**:
   - The program calculates the minimum time required to transition between blocks (subway walk or lift ride) using the formula `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.
   - This accounts for the shortest path either directly or by going around the building.

4. **Minimum Floor Transition Time**:
   - The program calculates the minimum time required to move between floors within the same block using the formula `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` if `a_floor > b_floor`, otherwise `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.
   - This accounts for the elevator ride time plus the walking time if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - The program adds the minimum block transition time and the minimum floor transition time to get the total minimum time.

#### Test Cases Analysis:
- The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program. The logic appears sound and matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases like moving from one side of the building to the other effectively using the `min` function for block transitions and simple arithmetic for floor transitions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment according to the problem description.

**Correctness:** **True**
