The provided code reads four integer inputs from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. Since the actual input values are not specified, we will keep the variables in their general form as per the initial state conditions. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers representing the cost of a plastic liter bottle, the cost of a glass liter bottle, and the amount of money Kolya gets back for returning an empty glass bottle, respectively, with the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18.

After executing the code block, the following assignments are made:
- `n` is set to the value of the first input.
- `a` is set to the value of the second input.
- `b` is set to the value of the third input.
- `c` is set to the value of the fourth input.

Since no further operations are performed on these variables, their values remain as input by the user.

Output State: **n is the value of the first input, a is the value of the second input, b is the value of the third input, c is the value of the fourth input**
