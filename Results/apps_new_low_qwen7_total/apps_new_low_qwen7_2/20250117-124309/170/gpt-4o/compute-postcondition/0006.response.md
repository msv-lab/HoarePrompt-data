Let's break down the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `n` is `n - remaining_rubles`
   - `remaining_rubles` is `n - k * (b - c)`
   - `k` is `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`
   - `a` is `a`
   - `b` is `b`
   - `c` is `c`
   - The current value of `remaining_rubles` is less than `b`

2. Code Execution:
   ```python
   print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
   ```

3. Impact on Variables:
   - `k` and `remaining_rubles` are used in the print statement.
   - `remaining_rubles // a` computes an integer division of `remaining_rubles` by `a`.
   - The result of `k + (remaining_rubles // a)` is printed.

Since `remaining_rubles` is less than `b` and `b - c` is a positive value (as `k` is calculated assuming `b > c`), `remaining_rubles // a` will be 0 because `remaining_rubles` is less than `b` and thus less than `a * (b - c) / (b - c)`, making the integer division result 0.

4. Output:
   - The value of `k + remaining_rubles // a` is `k + 0 = k`.

5. Updated Values:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `remaining_rubles` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `c` remains unchanged.
   - The current value of `remaining_rubles` is still less than `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is `n - remaining_rubles`, `remaining_rubles` is `n - k * (b - c)`, `k` is `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`, `a` is `a`, `b` is `b`, `c` is `c`, the current value of `remaining_rubles` is less than `b`, and the output of the print statement is `k`.**
