Output State: **n is n - remaining_rubles, remaining_rubles is n - k * (b - c), k is (n - b) // (b - c) + 1, a is a, b is b, c is c**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates `k` as `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`. This formula determines the number of full steps of `(b - c)` that can be subtracted from `n` before reaching or going below `b`.
- The second line calculates `remaining_rubles` as `n - k * (b - c)`, which represents the remainder after performing the full steps calculated in the first line.
- Variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n` are updated as described above, with `a` and `b - c` relationship still holding true.
