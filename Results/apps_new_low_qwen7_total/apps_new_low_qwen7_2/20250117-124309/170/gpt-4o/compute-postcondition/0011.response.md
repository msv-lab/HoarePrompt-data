The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, and one optional parameter `c`. The parameter `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, `a` is a positive integer representing the cost of a plastic liter bottle, `b` is a positive integer representing the cost of a glass liter bottle, and `c` is a positive integer representing the amount of money Kolya gets back for returning an empty glass bottle, with the conditions that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), \(1 \leq a \leq 10^{18}\), and \(1 \leq c < b \leq 10^{18}\). Based on these inputs, the function returns the maximum number of liters of water Kolya can buy.
