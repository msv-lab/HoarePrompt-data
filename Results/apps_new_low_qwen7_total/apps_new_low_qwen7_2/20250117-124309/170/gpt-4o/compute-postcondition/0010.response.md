Postcondition: ***`n` is the value of the first input, `a` is the value of the second input, `b` is the value of the third input, `c` is the value of the fourth input. If `a <= b - c`, the function prints `n // a`. Otherwise, `remaining_rubles` is calculated as `n - k * (b - c)`, where `k` is `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`. If `remaining_rubles < b`, the function prints `k`. Otherwise, the function prints `k + 1`.***
