The code `print(k + 1)` prints the value of `k` plus 1. Based on the initial state, `k` is defined as `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`. The print statement does not change the value of `k`, it only outputs it. Since `k` is already defined in terms of `n`, `b`, and `c`, and no other variables are affected by this line of code, the output of the print statement will be `k + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is `n - remaining_rubles`
- `remaining_rubles` is `n - k * (b - c)`
- `k` is `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`
- `a` is a
- `b` is b
- `c` is c
- `remaining_rubles` is greater than or equal to `b`

The output of the print statement is `k + 1`. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is `n - remaining_rubles`, `remaining_rubles` is `n - k * (b - c)`, `k` is `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`, `a` is a, `b` is b, `c` is c, `remaining_rubles` is greater than or equal to `b`, the value of `k + 1` is printed.**
