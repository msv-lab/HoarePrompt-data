Reasoning:

The program provided aims to calculate the maximum number of liters of kefir that Kolya can drink given the costs of plastic and glass bottles and the refund for returning a glass bottle. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the initial number of rubles `n` and the costs `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Decision Based on Cost Comparison**: 
   - If `a <= b - c`, Kolya should buy as many plastic bottles as possible since they are cheaper than the net cost of a glass bottle after refund.
   - Otherwise, Kolya should buy glass bottles and use the refund mechanism to maximize the number of liters he can drink.

3. **Calculation for Glass Bottles and Refunds**:
   - Calculate how many glass bottles `k` Kolya can initially buy: `k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1`.
   - Calculate the remaining rubles after buying `k` glass bottles: `remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)`.
   - If the remaining rubles are less than the cost of a glass bottle (`b`), Kolya can only drink `k` liters.
   - Otherwise, Kolya can buy one additional plastic bottle, so the total liters would be `k + 1`.

The logic in the code matches the described strategy, and it correctly handles the edge cases. Hereâ€™s the detailed breakdown:

- If `a <= b - c`, the program simply outputs `n // a`, which is the maximum number of plastic bottles Kolya can buy.
- If `a > b - c`, the program calculates the number of glass bottles Kolya can buy and then uses the remaining rubles to buy additional plastic bottles if possible.

The given logic appears to be correct according to the problem statement and constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**
