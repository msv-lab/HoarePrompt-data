### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initial Variables:**
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   a = int(input())
   b = int(input())
   c = int(input())
   ```
   This part correctly reads the input values and assigns them to variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   ```python
   if a <= b - c:
       print(n // a)
   else:
       k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1
       remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
       if remaining_rubles < b:
           print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
       else:
           print(k + 1)
   ```

   - **Case 1: `a <= b - c`:**
     - This condition checks if buying a plastic bottle is cheaper than buying a glass bottle and getting a refund.
     - If true, the program simply prints the number of plastic bottles Kolya can buy: `n // a`.
   
   - **Case 2: `a > b - c`:**
     - Here, the program attempts to calculate the maximum number of liters Kolya can drink by buying glass bottles and using the refund to buy more bottles.
     - `k` is calculated as the number of full cycles of buying a glass bottle and getting a refund: `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`.
     - `remaining_rubles` is the amount of money left after buying `k` glass bottles.
     - The program then checks if `remaining_rubles` is less than `b` (the cost of a glass bottle).
       - If true, it prints `k + remaining_rubles // a`, meaning Kolya can buy `k` glass bottles and use the remaining rubles to buy a plastic bottle.
       - If false, it prints `k + 1`, meaning Kolya can buy `k` glass bottles and still have enough rubles to buy another glass bottle after the refund.

#### Detailed Analysis of the Program:

1. **Handling `a <= b - c`:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if buying a plastic bottle is cheaper, Kolya should buy as many plastic bottles as possible: `n // a`.
   - This is the optimal solution when buying plastic bottles is cheaper.

2. **Handling `a > b - c`:**
   - The logic in this case is more complex. The program tries to buy as many glass bottles as possible and use the refund to buy more bottles.
   - The calculation of `k` and `remaining_rubles` is correct.
   - The check `if remaining_rubles < b` ensures that Kolya can no longer buy a glass bottle and must use the remaining rubbles to buy a plastic bottle if available.
   - The final print statement `print(k + 1)` is correct because it accounts for the possibility of buying an additional glass bottle after the last refund.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly handles all cases, including edge cases and extreme values, as long as the logic is implemented correctly.

#### Original Assessment Evaluation:

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because the logic for calculating the maximum amount of kefir Kolya can drink is flawed. However, upon detailed analysis, we find that the program does indeed handle all cases correctly, including the more complex scenario where Kolya buys glass bottles and uses the refund to buy more bottles.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct and handles all cases as required by the problem statement.
