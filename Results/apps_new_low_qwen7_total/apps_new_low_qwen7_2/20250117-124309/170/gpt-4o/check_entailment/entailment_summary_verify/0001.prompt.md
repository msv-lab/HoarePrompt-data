You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Kolya Gerasimov loves kefir very much. He lives in year 1984 and knows all the details of buying this delicious drink. One day, as you probably know, he found himself in year 2084, and buying kefir there is much more complicated.

Kolya is hungry, so he went to the nearest milk shop. In 2084 you may buy kefir in a plastic liter bottle, that costs a rubles, or in glass liter bottle, that costs b rubles. Also, you may return empty glass bottle and get c (c < b) rubles back, but you cannot return plastic bottles.

Kolya has n rubles and he is really hungry, so he wants to drink as much kefir as possible. There were no plastic bottles in his 1984, so Kolya doesn't know how to act optimally and asks for your help.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of rubles Kolya has at the beginning.

Then follow three lines containing integers a, b and c (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18) — the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — maximum number of liters of kefir, that Kolya can drink.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
11
9
8

Output
2

Input
10
5
6
1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, then return it and buy one more glass bottle. Thus he will drink 2 liters of kefir.

In the second sample, Kolya can buy two plastic bottle and get two liters of kefir, or he can buy one liter glass bottle, then return it and buy one plastic bottle. In both cases he will drink two liters of kefir.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    if a <= b - c:
        print(n // a)
    else:
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1
        remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if remaining_rubles < b:
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else:
            print(k + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of rubles Kolya has), `a` (the cost of a plastic liter bottle), `b` (the cost of a glass liter bottle), and `c` (the amount of money Kolya gets back for returning an empty glass bottle). It calculates and returns the maximum number of liters of water Kolya can buy. Specifically, the function determines whether it is more cost-effective for Kolya to buy plastic bottles or to buy glass bottles and return them for refunds. If buying plastic bottles directly is cheaper (`a <= b - c`), the function returns the number of plastic bottles Kolya can buy. Otherwise, it calculates the number of glass bottles Kolya can initially buy and return, and then adds the additional plastic bottles he can buy with the refunded money. The function handles all possible values within the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18). Edge cases such as when `n` is very large or when `a`, `b`, and `c` have extreme values are also considered.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided Python function aims to calculate the maximum amount of kefir Kolya can drink given the constraints of buying plastic and glass bottles and the refund for returning glass bottles.

1. **Initial Conditions and Assumptions:**
   - `n` is the initial number of rubles.
   - `a` is the cost of a plastic bottle.
   - `b` is the cost of a glass bottle.
   - `c` is the refund for returning a glass bottle (with \( c < b \)).

2. **Core Logic Analysis:**
   - The function first checks if it's cheaper or equally expensive to buy a plastic bottle compared to the cost of a glass bottle minus its refund (`b - c`). This condition is checked with the inequality `a <= b - c`.
   - If it is cheaper or equally expensive to buy a plastic bottle, the function calculates how many plastic bottles Kolya can buy directly with his rubles: `n // a`.
   - Otherwise, the function considers buying a glass bottle first and then calculating how many additional bottles (plastic or glass) he can acquire using the refund from returning the glass bottle.
   - The variable `k` is calculated as the number of times Kolya can fully pay for a glass bottle and still get the refund: `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`. Here, `+1` is added because even if there is not enough money left to buy another full glass bottle, the refund can still be used.
   - `remaining_rubles` is the leftover money after buying `k` glass bottles: `n - k * (b - c)`.
   - If the remaining rubles are not enough to buy another glass bottle (`remaining_rubles < b`), the function calculates how many additional plastic bottles can be bought with these remaining rubles: `remaining_rubles // a` and adds this to `k`.
   - If the remaining rubles are enough to buy another glass bottle, the function increments `k` by 1 to account for this additional glass bottle.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where Kolya might have enough money left to buy an additional glass bottle after the initial purchase.
   - The function correctly accounts for the refund from returning glass bottles and uses it to buy more bottles.

Given the logical flow and the conditions handled in the function, it accurately computes the maximum amount of kefir Kolya can drink based on the provided problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The provided function appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
