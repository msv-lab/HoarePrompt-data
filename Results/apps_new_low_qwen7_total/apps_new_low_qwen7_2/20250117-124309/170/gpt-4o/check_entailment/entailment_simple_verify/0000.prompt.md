You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Kolya Gerasimov loves kefir very much. He lives in year 1984 and knows all the details of buying this delicious drink. One day, as you probably know, he found himself in year 2084, and buying kefir there is much more complicated.

Kolya is hungry, so he went to the nearest milk shop. In 2084 you may buy kefir in a plastic liter bottle, that costs a rubles, or in glass liter bottle, that costs b rubles. Also, you may return empty glass bottle and get c (c < b) rubles back, but you cannot return plastic bottles.

Kolya has n rubles and he is really hungry, so he wants to drink as much kefir as possible. There were no plastic bottles in his 1984, so Kolya doesn't know how to act optimally and asks for your help.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of rubles Kolya has at the beginning.

Then follow three lines containing integers a, b and c (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18) — the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — maximum number of liters of kefir, that Kolya can drink.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
11
9
8

Output
2

Input
10
5
6
1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, then return it and buy one more glass bottle. Thus he will drink 2 liters of kefir.

In the second sample, Kolya can buy two plastic bottle and get two liters of kefir, or he can buy one liter glass bottle, then return it and buy one plastic bottle. In both cases he will drink two liters of kefir.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    if a <= b - c:
        print(n // a)
    else:
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1
        remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if remaining_rubles < b:
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else:
            print(k + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, and a, b, and c are positive integers representing the cost of a plastic liter bottle, the cost of a glass liter bottle, and the amount of money Kolya gets back for returning an empty glass bottle, respectively, with the condition that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

c = int(input())
    if (a <= b - c) :
        print(n // a)
    else :
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1

remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if (remaining_rubles < b) :
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else :
            print(k + 1)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is `n - remaining_rubles`, `remaining_rubles` is `n - k * (b - c)`, `k` is `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`, `a` is `a`, `b` is `b`, `c` is `c`. If `remaining_rubles < b`, the function prints `k`. Otherwise, the function prints `k + 1`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is the value of the first input, `a` is the value of the second input, `b` is the value of the third input, `c` is the value of the fourth input. If `a <= b - c`, the function prints `n // a`. Otherwise, `remaining_rubles` is calculated as `n - k * (b - c)`, where `k` is `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`. If `remaining_rubles < b`, the function prints `k`. Otherwise, the function prints `k + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum amount of kefir Kolya can drink is flawed. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

For the input:
```
100
15
20
10
```
- Kolya has 100 rubles.
- A plastic bottle costs 15 rubles.
- A glass bottle costs 20 rubles.
- Returning a glass bottle gives 10 rubles back.

The program logic tries to maximize the number of liters Kolya can drink by considering whether buying a plastic bottle or a glass bottle plus the refund from returning it is more beneficial. However, the current logic does not fully explore all possible scenarios.

A more detailed analysis and correct approach would involve:
1. Buying as many glass bottles as possible with the initial rubles and using the refund to buy additional bottles.
2. Considering the scenario where Kolya buys a glass bottle, returns it, and repeats until he runs out of money or can no longer afford a glass bottle.

Here’s a revised version of the function that handles all cases correctly:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input()
    
    # Buy as many glass bottles as possible initially
    max_glass_bottles = n // b
    remaining_rubles = n - max_glass_bottles * b
    
    # Use the refund to buy more bottles
    total_liters = max_glass_bottles
    while remaining_rubles >= b - c:
        k = remaining_rubles // (b - c)
        remaining_rubles -= k * (b - c)
        total_liters += k
        if remaining_rubles >= a:
            total_liters += 1
            remaining_rubles -= a
        else:
            break
    
    print(total_liters)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Kolya considers all possible ways to maximize the number of liters he can drink by buying and returning bottles optimally.
