Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Kolya Gerasimov loves kefir very much. He lives in year 1984 and knows all the details of buying this delicious drink. One day, as you probably know, he found himself in year 2084, and buying kefir there is much more complicated.

Kolya is hungry, so he went to the nearest milk shop. In 2084 you may buy kefir in a plastic liter bottle, that costs a rubles, or in glass liter bottle, that costs b rubles. Also, you may return empty glass bottle and get c (c < b) rubles back, but you cannot return plastic bottles.

Kolya has n rubles and he is really hungry, so he wants to drink as much kefir as possible. There were no plastic bottles in his 1984, so Kolya doesn't know how to act optimally and asks for your help.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of rubles Kolya has at the beginning.

Then follow three lines containing integers a, b and c (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18) — the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — maximum number of liters of kefir, that Kolya can drink.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
11
9
8

Output
2

Input
10
5
6
1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, then return it and buy one more glass bottle. Thus he will drink 2 liters of kefir.

In the second sample, Kolya can buy two plastic bottle and get two liters of kefir, or he can buy one liter glass bottle, then return it and buy one plastic bottle. In both cases he will drink two liters of kefir.

# Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    if a <= b - c:
        print(n // a)
    else:
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1
        remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if remaining_rubles < b:
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else:
            print(k + 1)





# Execution Summary:
The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of rubles Kolya has), `a` (the cost of a plastic liter bottle), `b` (the cost of a glass liter bottle), and `c` (the amount of money Kolya gets back for returning an empty glass bottle). It calculates and returns the maximum number of liters of water Kolya can buy. Specifically, the function determines whether it is more cost-effective for Kolya to buy plastic bottles or to buy glass bottles and return them for refunds. If buying plastic bottles directly is cheaper (`a <= b - c`), the function returns the number of plastic bottles Kolya can buy. Otherwise, it calculates the number of glass bottles Kolya can initially buy and return, and then adds the additional plastic bottles he can buy with the refunded money. The function handles all possible values within the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18). Edge cases such as when `n` is very large or when `a`, `b`, and `c` have extreme values are also considered.
