Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the scenario where it is more cost-effective to buy plastic bottles directly if \( a \leq b - c \).
- For the case where buying glass bottles and returning them for refunds is more beneficial (\( a > b - c \)), the program calculates the initial number of glass bottles Kolya can buy and return.
- After returning the glass bottles, the program correctly calculates the remaining rubles and uses these to buy additional plastic bottles.
- The logic seems to handle all edge cases, including very large values of \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), as specified in the constraints.
- The program's approach aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
