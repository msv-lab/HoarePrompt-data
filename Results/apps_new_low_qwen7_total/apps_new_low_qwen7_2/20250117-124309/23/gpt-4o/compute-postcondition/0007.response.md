Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and for all `i` in the range of `0` to `n-1`, the character at index `i` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return a specific value (since there is no return statement in the else part).***
