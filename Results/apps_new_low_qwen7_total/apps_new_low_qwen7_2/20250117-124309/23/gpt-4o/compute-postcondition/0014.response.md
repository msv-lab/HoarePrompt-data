Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of only English letters and checks whether `s` is a palindrome. It returns `False` if the string is not a palindrome and `True` if the string is a palindrome. The function iterates through the first half of the string, comparing characters from the start and the end moving towards the center. If it finds any mismatch, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`. The function handles strings of lengths between 1 and 1000, inclusive.**

Edge Cases:
- The function correctly handles strings of length 1, which are trivially palindromes.
- The function correctly identifies longer strings as palindromes if the characters at mirrored positions are identical throughout the string.
- The function correctly returns `False` for any string that contains at least one pair of non-matching characters.
