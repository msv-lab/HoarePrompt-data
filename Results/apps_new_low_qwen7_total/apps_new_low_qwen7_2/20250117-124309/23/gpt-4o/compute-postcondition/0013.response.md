The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting of only English letters and its length is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The function has four return cases, all of which return `False` except for one case where it returns `True` indicating that the string `s` is a palindrome.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return `True` if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise return `False`.
