Output State: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; for all `i` in the range of `0` to `n-1`, the character at index `i` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`. If the loop completes without returning False, it means the string `s` is a palindrome. Otherwise, the function will return False at some point during the loop execution.
