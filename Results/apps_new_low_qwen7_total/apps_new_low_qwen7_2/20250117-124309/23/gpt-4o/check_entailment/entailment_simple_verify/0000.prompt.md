You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call a string "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

 [Image] English alphabet 

You are given a string s. Check if the string is "s-palindrome".


-----Input-----

The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) which consists of only English letters.


-----Output-----

Print "TAK" if the string s is "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
oXoxoXo

Output
TAK

Input
bod

Output
TAK

Input
ER

Output
NIE

- Program: 
s = input().strip()
if func_1(s):
    print('TAK')
else:
    print('NIE')

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
    return True



- Annotated Code: 
s = input().strip()
if func_1(s):
    print('TAK')
else:
    print('NIE')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of only English letters and its length is between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; for all `i` in the range of `0` to `n-1`, the character at index `i` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`. If the loop completes without returning False, it means the string `s` is a palindrome. Otherwise, the function will return False at some point during the loop execution.
    return True
    #The program returns True indicating that the string 's' is a palindrome



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a given string is "s-palindrome" by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. The logic implemented in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the string is symmetric about its middle, which aligns with the definition of an "s-palindrome". Since the program handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description and all examples provided, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
