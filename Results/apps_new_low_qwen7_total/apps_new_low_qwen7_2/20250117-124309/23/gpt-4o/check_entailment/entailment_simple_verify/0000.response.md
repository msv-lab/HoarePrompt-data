### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a given string is an "s-palindrome." Let's break down the process:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The input string `s` is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - The function `func_1` is called with this string as an argument.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the length of the string `n`.
   - It iterates over the first half of the string using the loop `for i in range(n // 2):`.
   - For each character at index `i`, it checks if it matches the character at the corresponding position from the end of the string (`n - 1 - i`).
   - If a mismatch is found, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, the function returns `True`.

3. **Output:**
   - Based on the return value of `func_1`, the program prints either `'TAK'` or `'NIE'`.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, we can see that the program follows the correct approach to determine if a string is an "s-palindrome." The function `func_1` correctly checks for symmetry around the middle of the string. The original assessment accurately states that the program handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description and examples provided.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
