Reasoning:

1. The problem requires checking if a string is "s-palindrome," which is defined as a string being symmetric about the middle.
2. The provided solution uses a function `func_1` to check if the string `s` is a palindrome.
3. The logic inside `func_1` correctly checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and the end moving towards the center.
4. The function iterates through the first half of the string, ensuring that each character from the start matches the corresponding character from the end.
5. If a mismatch is found, the function returns `False` immediately.
6. If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, the function returns `True`.
7. The main part of the program correctly calls `func_1` and prints the appropriate output based on the result.

Given this analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a string is a palindrome, which aligns with the definition of an "s-palindrome" in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
