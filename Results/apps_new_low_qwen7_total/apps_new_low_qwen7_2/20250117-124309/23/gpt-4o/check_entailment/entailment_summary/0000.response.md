Reasoning:

1. The provided program correctly defines the function `func_1` that checks if a string is a palindrome.
2. The main part of the program uses this function to determine if the input string `s` is an "s-palindrome".
3. According to the problem statement, a string is "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string, which is exactly what the function `func_1` checks for (a standard palindrome check).
4. The program correctly prints 'TAK' if the string is a palindrome and 'NIE' otherwise, as per the problem requirements.
5. The function `func_1` is designed to handle strings of lengths between 1 and 1000, inclusive, which matches the input constraints given in the problem.

Given these points, the program logic and implementation match the problem description perfectly.

Correctness: **True**
