You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call a string "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

 [Image] English alphabet 

You are given a string s. Check if the string is "s-palindrome".


-----Input-----

The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) which consists of only English letters.


-----Output-----

Print "TAK" if the string s is "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
oXoxoXo

Output
TAK

Input
bod

Output
TAK

Input
ER

Output
NIE

- Program:
s = input().strip()
if func_1(s):
    print('TAK')
else:
    print('NIE')

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
    return True



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of only English letters and checks whether `s` is a palindrome. It returns `False` if the string is not a palindrome and `True` if the string is a palindrome. The function iterates through the first half of the string, comparing characters from the start and the end moving towards the center. If it finds any mismatch, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`. The function handles strings of lengths between 1 and 1000, inclusive.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a given string is "s-palindrome" by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. The logic implemented in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the string is symmetric about its middle, which aligns with the definition of an "s-palindrome". Since the program handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description and all examples provided, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
