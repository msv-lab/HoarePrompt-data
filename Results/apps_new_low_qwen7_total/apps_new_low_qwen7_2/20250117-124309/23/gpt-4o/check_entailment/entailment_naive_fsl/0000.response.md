Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a given string is "s-palindrome" by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. The logic implemented in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the string is symmetric about its middle, which aligns with the definition of an "s-palindrome". Since the program handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description and all examples provided, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
