Output State: `i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is equal to the number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s_new`, `j` is `-1` (since `j` starts at `len(s_new) - 2` and is decremented until it reaches -1), `len(s_new)` is at least 2, and `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and 0. The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. Once `j` becomes -1, the loop terminates.
