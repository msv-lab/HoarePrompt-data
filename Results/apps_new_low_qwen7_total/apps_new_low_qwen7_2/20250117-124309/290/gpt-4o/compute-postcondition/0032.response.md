`new_count_vk` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `new_count_vk` is either 1 or 2, so after adding 1, the new value will be either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables (`i`, `s`, `j`, and `len(s_new)`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0; `s` is the input string; `new_count_vk` is either 2 or 3; `j` is 2; and `len(s_new)` must be greater than 2.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `s` is the input string; `new_count_vk` is either 2 or 3; `j` is 2; and `len(s_new)` must be greater than 2.**
