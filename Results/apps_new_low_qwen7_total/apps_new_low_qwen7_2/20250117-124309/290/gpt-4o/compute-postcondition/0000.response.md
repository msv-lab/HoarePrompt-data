The initial state is defined by the input string `s`, which consists only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive. The variable `count_vk` is initialized to 0.

The provided code snippet reads the input string `s` and initializes `count_vk` to 0. However, the snippet does not include any lines that modify the value of `count_vk` or any other variables. Therefore, `count_vk` remains 0 after executing the code.

Since the input string `s` is not processed or modified in the given code, it remains unchanged. The final output state includes the input string `s` and the value of `count_vk`.

Output State: **s is the input string, count_vk is 0**
