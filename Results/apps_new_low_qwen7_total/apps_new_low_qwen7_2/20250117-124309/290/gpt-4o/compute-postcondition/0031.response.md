The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `len(s_new)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `len(s_new)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 1, and `len(s_new)` must be at least 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(s_new) - 1`. Since `j` is currently 1, `len(s_new)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 0, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2, and `len(s_new)` must be greater than 2**
