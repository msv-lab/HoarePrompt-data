The code snippet updates `max_vk` to be the maximum value between the current `max_vk` and `new_count_vk`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact value of `max_vk`. Since `new_count_vk` is defined as the number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s_new`, and no specific value for `new_count_vk` is given, we can only express the updated value of `max_vk` in terms of `new_count_vk`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `max_vk` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `new_count_vk`.
2. `new_count_vk` is defined as the number of occurrences of "VK" in `s_new`, which remains unchanged.
3. The values of `i`, `s`, `j`, and `len(s_new)` are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is equal to the number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s_new`, `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`, and `len(s_new)` must be at least 2; `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and `new_count_vk`.**
