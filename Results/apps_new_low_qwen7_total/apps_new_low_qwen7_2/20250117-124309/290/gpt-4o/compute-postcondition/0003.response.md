The code `count_vk += 1` increments the value of `count_vk` by 1. Given the initial state where `count_vk` is 0, after executing this line, `count_vk` will be 1. The other variables (`s`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `count_vk` is 1, `i` must be between 0 and len(s) - 2 inclusive. The current value of `s[i]` is 'V', and the current value of `s[i + 1]` is 'K'.**
