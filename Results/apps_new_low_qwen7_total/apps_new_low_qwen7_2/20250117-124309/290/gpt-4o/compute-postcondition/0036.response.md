Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   The loop head `for i in range(len(s)):` indicates that the loop variable is `i` and it iterates over the range defined by `len(s)`.

2. **Determine the current state:**
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `new_count_vk` is the count of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s_new`.
   - `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`.
   - `len(s_new)` must be at least 2.
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and `new_count_vk`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(s)`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - The other variables (`s`, `new_count_vk`, `j`, `len(s_new)`, and `max_vk`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and are not modified within the loop body (based on the information provided).

5. **Construct the new state:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `new_count_vk` remains the same.
   - `j` is still `len(s_new) - 2`.
   - `len(s_new)` remains at least 2.
   - `max_vk` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is equal to the number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s_new`, `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`, and `len(s_new)` must be at least 2; `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and `new_count_vk`**.
