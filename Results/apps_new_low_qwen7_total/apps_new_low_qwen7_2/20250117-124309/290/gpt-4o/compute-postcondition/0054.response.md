The code `max_vk = max(max_vk, new_count_vk)` updates the value of `max_vk` to be the maximum of its current value and `new_count_vk`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `new_count_vk`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `max_vk`. The only thing we know is that `max_vk` will be updated to be at least as large as `new_count_vk`.

Given the initial state, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is equal to the number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s_new`, `j` is -1, `len(s_new)` is at least 2, and `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and `new_count_vk`.**
