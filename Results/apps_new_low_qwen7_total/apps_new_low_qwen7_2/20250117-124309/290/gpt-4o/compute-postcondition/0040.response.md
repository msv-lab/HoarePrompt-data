Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is equal to the number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s_new`, `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`, and `len(s_new)` must be at least 2; `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and `new_count_vk`. The function checks if `s[i]` is 'K', and if so, updates `s_new` to `s[0] + 'V' + s[2:]`. If `s[i]` is not 'K', `s_new` remains unchanged and the same as the input `s`.***
