`new_count_vk` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is 2, `j` is `len(s_new) - 3`, `len(s_new)` must be at least 3, and `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and 0.
