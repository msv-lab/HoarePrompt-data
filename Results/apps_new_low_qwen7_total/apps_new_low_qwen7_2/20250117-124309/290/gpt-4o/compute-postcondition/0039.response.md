The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not show which loop this statement belongs to. Since no loop is specified, the behavior of `continue` is ambiguous in this context. Nevertheless, based on the provided initial state, none of the variables are affected by the `continue` statement itself, as it does not perform any operations or assignments.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is equal to the number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s_new`, `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`, and `len(s_new)` must be at least 2; `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and `new_count_vk`**
