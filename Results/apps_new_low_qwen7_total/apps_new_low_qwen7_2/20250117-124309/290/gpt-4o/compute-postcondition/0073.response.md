The code snippet `max_vk = max(max_vk, new_count_vk)` updates the value of `max_vk` to be the maximum of its current value and `new_count_vk`. However, the exact values of `max_vk` and `new_count_vk` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine their specific values after this operation. The other variables (`s`, `s_new`, `j`, and `new_count_vk`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `s_new` is a string resulting from inserting 'K' at position `i` if `s[i]` is 'V', and replacing 'K' with 'V' if `s[i]` is 'K', `j` is equal to the length of `s_new` minus 1, `new_count_vk` is the total number of occurrences where 'V' is immediately followed by 'K' in `s_new`, `max_vk` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `new_count_vk`.**
