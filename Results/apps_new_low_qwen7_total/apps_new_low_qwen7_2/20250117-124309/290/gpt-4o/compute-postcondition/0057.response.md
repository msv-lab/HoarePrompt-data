`s_new` is assigned the value of `s[:i] + 'V' + s[i + 1:]`. This operation slices the string `s` from the beginning up to index `i`, adds the character `'V'`, and then concatenates the rest of the string starting from `i + 1`.

Since the initial values of `s` and `i` are not specified, let's denote them as follows:

- `s` is an initial string
- `i` is an index within the range of `s`

After executing the code, `s_new` will contain the modified string based on the given operation.

Output State: **`s_new` is the string formed by `s[:i] + 'V' + s[i + 1:]`, `s` is the initial string, `i` is the initial index**
