Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `len(s_new) - 1`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 1 (this variable is not used in the loop condition).
   - `s` is the input string (not used in the loop condition).
   - `new_count_vk` is 0 (this variable is not used in the loop condition).
   - `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`.
   - `len(s_new)` is at least 2.
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and 0 (this variable is not used in the loop condition).

3. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `len(s_new) - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be `0`.

4. **Initial Value of `j`:**
   - Initially, `j` is set to `len(s_new) - 2`.

5. **Condition for First Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must transition from `len(s_new) - 2` to `0`.
   - This means `len(s_new) - 2` must be greater than or equal to `0` (which is already given as `len(s_new) >= 2`).

6. **Summary:**
   - The initial value of `j` must be `len(s_new) - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `len(s_new)` must be at least 3 (so that `len(s_new) - 2` is non-negative and `j` can become `0`).

Therefore, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is 0, `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`, `len(s_new)` must be at least 3, and `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and 0.**
