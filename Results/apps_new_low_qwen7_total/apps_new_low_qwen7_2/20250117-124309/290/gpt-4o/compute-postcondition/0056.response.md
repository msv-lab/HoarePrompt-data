The code snippet `s_new = s[:i] + 'K' + s[i + 1:]` impacts the string `s` by inserting the character 'K' at index `i`. The variables `s` and `i` are used in this operation. After executing the code, `s_new` will be a new string derived from `s` with 'K' inserted at position `i`.

Output State: **`s_new` is a new string derived from `s` with 'K' inserted at position `i`; `s` remains unchanged; `i` remains unchanged**
