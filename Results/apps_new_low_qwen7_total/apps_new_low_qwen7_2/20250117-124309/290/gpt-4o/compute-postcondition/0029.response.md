The value of `new_count_vk` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is either 1 or 2 (depending on its initial value), `j` is 1, and `len(s_new)` must be at least 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 1, and `len(s_new)` must be at least 1**
