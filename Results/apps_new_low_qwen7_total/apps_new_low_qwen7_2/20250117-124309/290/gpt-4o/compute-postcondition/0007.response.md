Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `count_vk` is 2, `i` must be between 0 and len(s) - 2 inclusive and be such that i + 1 < len(s) - 1, the current value of s[i] is 'V', and the current value of s[i + 1] is 'K'.** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows the if part. After executing the if statement, the value of `count_vk` is incremented to 2 if the condition `s[i] == 'V' and s[i + 1] == 'K'` is true. The positions and values of `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
