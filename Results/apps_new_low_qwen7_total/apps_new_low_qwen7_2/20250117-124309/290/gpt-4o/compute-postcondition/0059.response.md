Precondition: `s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s`.

Program Fragment:
```python
if s[i] == 'K':
    s_new = s[:i] + 'V' + s[i + 1:]
else:
    # No change to s_new, it remains the same as s
```

If part: `s_new` is the string formed by `s[:i] + 'V' + s[i + 1:]`, `s` is the initial string, `i` is the initial index.

Else part: `s_new` remains the same as `s`, `s` is the initial string, `i` is the initial index.

Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, and `s_new` is either the string formed by replacing the character at index `i` with 'V' if `s[i]` is 'K', or it remains unchanged as `s` if `s[i]` is not 'K'.***
