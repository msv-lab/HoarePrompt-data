`count_vk` is incremented by 1, which means its new value is `1 + 1 = 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string, `count_vk` is 2, `i` must be between 0 and len(s) - 2 inclusive and be such that i + 1 < len(s) - 1, the current value of s[i] is 'V', and the current value of s[i + 1] is 'K'.
