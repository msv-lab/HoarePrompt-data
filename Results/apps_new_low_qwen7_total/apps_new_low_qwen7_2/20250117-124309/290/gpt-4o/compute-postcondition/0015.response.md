`s_new` is assigned the value of `s` from the start up to index `i` (which is 'V'), followed by 'K', and then the substring of `s` starting from `i + 1` (which is the next character after 'V'). Since `s[i]` is 'V', the new string `s_new` will be the string `s` with 'V' replaced by 'K'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `s` is the input string; `s_new` is the string `s` with 'V' replaced by 'K';**
