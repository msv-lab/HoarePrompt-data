Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is 2, `j` is `len(s_new) - 3`, `len(s_new)` must be at least 3, and `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and 0. If `s_new[j] == 'V'` and `s_new[j + 1] == 'K'`, then `new_count_vk` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.**
