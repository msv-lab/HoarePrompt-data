To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `i` is 0 (this variable is not used in the loop).
- `s` is the input string.
- `new_count_vk` is 0 (this variable is not used in the loop).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(len(s_new) - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable in the `for` loop is `j`.
2. **Range of the Loop**: The loop runs for `len(s_new) - 1` iterations.
3. **Initial Value of `j`**: Before the loop starts, `j` should be set to 0 because the `range` function in Python starts from 0 by default.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute the First Time:
- For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be 0.
- The condition `len(s_new) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, otherwise, the loop will not run at all. This implies that `len(s_new)` must be at least 1.

### State at the Start of the Loop:
- `i` is 0 (though it is not used in the loop, we include it for completeness).
- `s` is the input string (though it is not used in the loop, we include it for completeness).
- `new_count_vk` is 0 (though it is not used in the loop, we include it for completeness).
- `j` must be 0.
- `len(s_new)` must be at least 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is 0, `j` is 0, `len(s_new)` must be at least 1**
