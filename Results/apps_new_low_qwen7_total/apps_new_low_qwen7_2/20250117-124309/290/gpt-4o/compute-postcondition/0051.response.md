`new_count_vk` is incremented by 1. Initially, `new_count_vk` is 2, so after the increment, `new_count_vk` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is 3, `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`, `len(s_new)` must be at least 3, and `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and 0**
