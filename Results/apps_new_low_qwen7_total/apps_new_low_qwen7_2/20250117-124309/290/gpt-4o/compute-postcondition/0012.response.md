The variable `max_vk` is assigned the value of `count_vk`. Since `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences where 'V' is immediately followed by 'K' in the string `s`, and no new occurrences are being counted or modified in this line of code, the value of `max_vk` remains the same as `count_vk`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences where 'V' is immediately followed by 'K' in the string `s`, `max_vk` equals `count_vk`, and `i` can take any value from 0 to `len(s) - 2` inclusive.**
