Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined by the variable `i` in the range `range(len(s))`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `s` is the input string (no change needed as it is not in the loop head).
   - `new_count_vk` is the number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s_new` (no change needed as it is not in the loop head).
   - `j` is -1 (no change needed as it is not in the loop head).
   - `len(s_new)` is at least 2 (no change needed as it is not in the loop head).
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and `new_count_vk` (no change needed as it is not in the loop head).

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration where `i` is 1, the next value of `i` should be 2.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 2, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is equal to the number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s_new`, `j` is -1, `len(s_new)` is at least 2, and `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and `new_count_vk`**
