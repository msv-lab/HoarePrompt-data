The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code, the variables `i` and `s` remain unchanged. The condition that the first character of `s` is not 'K' also remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is the input string, and the first character of `s` is not 'K'**
