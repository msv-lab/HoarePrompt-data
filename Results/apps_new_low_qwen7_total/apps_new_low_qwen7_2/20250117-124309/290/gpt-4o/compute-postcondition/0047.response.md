Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and it iterates over the range `len(s_new) - 1`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < len(s_new) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `s` is the input string
   - `new_count_vk` is 1
   - `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`
   - `len(s_new)` must be at least 3
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and 0
   - `s_new[j]` is 'V'
   - `s_new[j + 1]` is 'K'

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `len(s_new) - 2` and the loop continues as long as `j < len(s_new) - 1`, the next value of `j` should be `len(s_new) - 2 - 1 = len(s_new) - 3`.
   - All other variables remain the same as they are not directly affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is 1, `j` is `len(s_new) - 3`, `len(s_new)` must be at least 3, and `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and 0.**
