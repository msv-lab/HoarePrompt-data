The code snippet replaces the character at index `i` in `s` with 'V' to form `s_new`. Given that `i` is 1, the character at index 1 in `s` is replaced by 'V'. Since the exact content of `s` is not specified, we can only express the change in terms of `s_new`.

- `s_new` is formed by taking the first character of `s` (unchanged), inserting 'V' at the second position, and appending the rest of `s` from the third character onwards.
- The other variables (`new_count_vk`, `j`, `len(s_new)`, and `max_vk`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `s_new` is `s[0] + 'V' + s[2:]`, `new_count_vk` is equal to the number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s_new`, `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`, and `len(s_new)` must be at least 2; `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and `new_count_vk`**
