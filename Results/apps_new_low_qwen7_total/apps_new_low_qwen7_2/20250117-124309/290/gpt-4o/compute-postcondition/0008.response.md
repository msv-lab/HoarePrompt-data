Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `count_vk` is 2.
   - `i` must be between 0 and `len(s) - 2` inclusive and satisfy `i + 1 < len(s) - 1`.
   - The current value of `s[i]` is 'V'.
   - The current value of `s[i + 1]` is 'K'.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(len(s) - 1)`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(s) - 2`, each iteration checks if `s[i]` is 'V' and `s[i + 1]` is 'K'.
   - For the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will now be `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i + 1 < len(s) - 1` must still hold true for the next iteration to occur.

4. **Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be such that `i + 1` is still within the valid range and `s[i + 1]` is 'K'.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - The new condition for the next iteration is `i + 1 < len(s) - 1`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The condition `i + 1 < len(s) - 1` must still hold.
- `count_vk` remains unchanged as no information suggests it changes within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is the input string, `count_vk` is 2, `i` must be between 0 and `len(s) - 2` inclusive and be such that `(i + 1) + 1 < len(s) - 1`, the current value of `s[i]` is 'V', and the current value of `s[i + 1]` is 'K'**.
