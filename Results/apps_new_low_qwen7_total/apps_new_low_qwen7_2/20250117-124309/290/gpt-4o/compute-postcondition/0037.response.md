`s_new` is assigned the value of `s[:i] + 'K' + s[i + 1:]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, this means `s_new` becomes `s[0] + 'K' + s[2:]`, effectively inserting 'K' at index 1. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `new_count_vk` is equal to the number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s_new`, `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`, `len(s_new)` must be at least 2; `max_vk` is the maximum of its original value and `new_count_vk`, `s_new` is `s[0] + 'K' + s[2:]**
