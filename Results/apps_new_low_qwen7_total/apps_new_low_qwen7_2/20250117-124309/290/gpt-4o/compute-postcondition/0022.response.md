Postcondition: **`i` is 0 and `s` is the input string. If the first character of `s` is 'V', then `s` is updated to 'K' + the rest of the string. If the first character of `s` is 'K', then `s` is updated to 'V' + the rest of the original `s` starting from index 1. Otherwise, the first character of `s` remains 'K'.**
