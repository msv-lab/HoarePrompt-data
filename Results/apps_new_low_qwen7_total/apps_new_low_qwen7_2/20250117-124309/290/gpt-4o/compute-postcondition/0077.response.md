Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive. It calculates and prints the maximum number of occurrences where "VK" can be formed by performing the following operations:

1. It counts the initial number of "VK" pairs in the string `s`.
2. For each character in the string `s`, it generates a new string by replacing the current character with the other (i.e., "V" becomes "K" and "K" becomes "V").
3. It counts the number of "VK" pairs in each of these new strings.
4. It keeps track of the maximum count of "VK" pairs found among all generated strings.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum count of "VK" pairs.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where the string `s` is empty (`len(s) == 0`). This would result in an error when attempting to access characters in the string.
- The function assumes that the input string `s` contains only "V" and "K" characters. If the string contains any other characters, the function will still run but the results may not be meaningful.
- The function does not provide any error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-string types or strings containing characters other than "V" and "K".
