Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `count_vk` is 3, `i` must be between 0 and `len(s) - 2` inclusive and be such that `(i + 1) + 1 < len(s) - 1`, the current value of `s[i]` is 'V', and the current value of `s[i + 1]` is 'K'. If the condition `s[i] == 'V' and s[i + 1] == 'K'` is true, then `count_vk` is incremented by 1.***
