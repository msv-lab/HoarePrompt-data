### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Count Calculation**:
   - The function correctly initializes `count_vk` to zero and iterates through the string to count the initial number of "VK" substrings.
   - This step is correct and essential for understanding the base number of "VK" pairs.

2. **Single Character Change Consideration**:
   - For each character in the string, the function attempts to change it to the opposite character ('V' to 'K' or 'K' to 'V').
   - This approach is sound and ensures that every possible single-character change is evaluated.

3. **Update Maximum Count**:
   - The function updates `max_vk` with the higher value between the current `max_vk` and the new count of "VK" substrings obtained from the modified string.
   - This step ensures that the maximum number of "VK" pairs is tracked correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles strings of varying lengths and compositions correctly.
   - However, there is a potential edge case that needs to be addressed: the function does not handle the scenario where the entire string is "V" or "K", which would result in a count of 0 initially and no changes needed.
   - Additionally, the function should consider the case where changing a 'K' to a 'V' might create additional "VK" pairs, and vice versa.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum number of "VK" substrings found after considering all possible changes.
   - This output is correct as long as the internal logic is sound.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `s = input()`
  - `count_vk = 0`
  - `for i in range(len(s) - 1):`
    - Counts initial "VK" pairs.
  - `max_vk = count_vk`

- **Change Character and Re-evaluate**:
  - For each character `i` in `s`, the function creates a new string `s_new` by changing `s[i]` to the opposite character.
  - `new_count_vk = 0`
  - `for j in range(len(s_new) - 1):`
    - Counts "VK" pairs in the new string.
  - `max_vk = max(max_vk, new_count_vk)`

- **Final State**:
  - Prints `max_vk`, which is the maximum number of "VK" pairs found after evaluating all possible single-character changes.

### Specific Edge Cases:
- **String consists entirely of 'V' or 'K'**:
  - If `s = "VV"`, the initial `count_vk` is 0. Changing any 'V' to 'K' results in `s_new = "KK"`, which still has 0 "VK" pairs.
  - The function correctly identifies that no change can increase the count of "VK" pairs.
  
- **String with many 'K's**:
  - If `s = "KKKKKKKKKKVVVVVVVVVK"`, the initial `count_vk` is 1. Changing a 'K' to 'V' can potentially increase the count.
  - The function correctly identifies that changing the first 'K' to 'V' results in `s_new = "VKKKKKKKKKVVVVVVVVVK"`, which has 3 "VK" pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of "VK" pairs by considering all possible single-character changes. The edge cases are handled appropriately, and the program logic is sound.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
