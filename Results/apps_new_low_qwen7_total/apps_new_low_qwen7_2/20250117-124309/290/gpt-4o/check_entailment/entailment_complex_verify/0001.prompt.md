You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Tonio has a keyboard with only two letters, "V" and "K".

One day, he has typed out a string s with only these two letters. He really likes it when the string "VK" appears, so he wishes to change at most one letter in the string (or do no changes) to maximize the number of occurrences of that string. Compute the maximum number of times "VK" can appear as a substring (i. e. a letter "K" right after a letter "V") in the resulting string.


-----Input-----

The first line will contain a string s consisting only of uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with length not less than 1 and not greater than 100.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer, the maximum number of times "VK" can appear as a substring of the given string after changing at most one character.


-----Examples-----
Input
VK

Output
1

Input
VV

Output
1

Input
V

Output
0

Input
VKKKKKKKKKVVVVVVVVVK

Output
3

Input
KVKV

Output
1



-----Note-----

For the first case, we do not change any letters. "VK" appears once, which is the maximum number of times it could appear.

For the second case, we can change the second character from a "V" to a "K". This will give us the string "VK". This has one occurrence of the string "VK" as a substring.

For the fourth case, we can change the fourth character from a "K" to a "V". This will give us the string "VKKVKKKKKKVVVVVVVVVK". This has three occurrences of the string "VK" as a substring. We can check no other moves can give us strictly more occurrences.

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    count_vk = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if s[i] == 'V' and s[i + 1] == 'K':
            count_vk += 1
    max_vk = count_vk
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 'V':
            s_new = s[:i] + 'K' + s[i + 1:]
        elif s[i] == 'K':
            s_new = s[:i] + 'V' + s[i + 1:]
        else:
            continue
        new_count_vk = 0
        for j in range(len(s_new) - 1):
            if s_new[j] == 'V' and s_new[j + 1] == 'K':
                new_count_vk += 1
        max_vk = max(max_vk, new_count_vk)
    print(max_vk)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string s consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive.
def func():
    s = input()

count_vk = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if s[i] == 'V' and s[i + 1] == 'K':
            count_vk += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the input string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences where 'V' is immediately followed by 'K' in the string `s`, and `i` can take any value from 0 to `len(s) - 2` inclusive. The final value of `count_vk` is the sum of 1 for each such occurrence in the string `s`.
    max_vk = count_vk
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 'V':
            s_new = s[:i] + 'K' + s[i + 1:]
        elif s[i] == 'K':
            s_new = s[:i] + 'V' + s[i + 1:]
        else:
            continue
        
        new_count_vk = 0
        
        for j in range(len(s_new) - 1):
            if s_new[j] == 'V' and s_new[j + 1] == 'K':
                new_count_vk += 1
        
        max_vk = max(max_vk, new_count_vk)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: s
    print(max_vk)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive. It calculates and prints the maximum number of occurrences where "VK" can be formed by performing the following operations:

1. It counts the initial number of "VK" pairs in the string `s`.
2. For each character in the string `s`, it generates a new string by replacing the current character with the other (i.e., "V" becomes "K" and "K" becomes "V").
3. It counts the number of "VK" pairs in each of these new strings.
4. It keeps track of the maximum count of "VK" pairs found among all generated strings.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum count of "VK" pairs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Count Calculation**:
   - The function correctly initializes `count_vk` to zero and iterates through the string to count the initial number of "VK" substrings.
   
2. **Single Character Change Consideration**:
   - For each character in the string, the function attempts to change it to the opposite character ('V' to 'K' or 'K' to 'V') and checks the new count of "VK" substrings.
   
3. **Update Maximum Count**:
   - The function updates `max_vk` with the higher value between the current `max_vk` and the new count of "VK" substrings obtained from the modified string.
   
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles strings of varying lengths and compositions correctly.
   - It considers all possible changes (up to one character) and calculates the maximum number of "VK" substrings that can be achieved.
   - The program does not attempt to change characters that are already part of a "VK" substring, which simplifies the logic and avoids unnecessary complexity.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum number of "VK" substrings found after considering all possible changes.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly counts initial "VK" substrings and properly evaluates the impact of changing up to one character to maximize the number of "VK" substrings, the provided program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
