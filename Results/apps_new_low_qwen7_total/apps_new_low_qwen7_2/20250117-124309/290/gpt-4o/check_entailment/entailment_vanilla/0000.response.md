### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Count Calculation**:
   - The function correctly initializes `count_vk` to zero and iterates through the string to count the initial number of "VK" substrings.
   
2. **Single Character Change Consideration**:
   - For each character in the string, the function attempts to change it to the opposite character ('V' to 'K' or 'K' to 'V') and checks the new count of "VK" substrings.
   
3. **Update Maximum Count**:
   - The function updates `max_vk` with the higher value between the current `max_vk` and the new count of "VK" substrings obtained from the modified string.
   
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles strings of varying lengths and compositions correctly.
   - It considers all possible changes (up to one character) and calculates the maximum number of "VK" substrings that can be achieved.
   - The program does not attempt to change characters that are already part of a "VK" substring, which simplifies the logic and avoids unnecessary complexity.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum number of "VK" substrings found after considering all possible changes.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly counts initial "VK" substrings and properly evaluates the impact of changing up to one character to maximize the number of "VK" substrings, the provided program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
