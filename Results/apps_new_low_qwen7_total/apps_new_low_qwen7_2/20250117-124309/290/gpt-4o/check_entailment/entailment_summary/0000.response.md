Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the count of "VK" pairs in the original string `s`.
2. It then iterates through each character in the string, generating a new string by replacing the current character with the other ("V" to "K" or "K" to "V").
3. For each new string, it counts the number of "VK" pairs.
4. It updates the maximum count of "VK" pairs found.
5. The program handles all possible cases by considering each character and generating the modified strings accordingly.
6. The constraints (string length between 1 and 100) are respected.
7. The logic ensures that no more than one character is changed, adhering to the problem's requirement.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of "VK" pairs after changing at most one character.

Correctness: **True**
