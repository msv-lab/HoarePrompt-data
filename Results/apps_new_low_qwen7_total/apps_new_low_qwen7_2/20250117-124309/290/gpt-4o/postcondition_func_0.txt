The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive. It calculates and prints the maximum number of occurrences where "VK" can be formed by performing the following operations:

1. It counts the initial number of "VK" pairs in the string `s`.
2. For each character in the string `s`, it generates a new string by replacing the current character with the other (i.e., "V" becomes "K" and "K" becomes "V").
3. It counts the number of "VK" pairs in each of these new strings.
4. It keeps track of the maximum count of "VK" pairs found among all generated strings.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum count of "VK" pairs.
