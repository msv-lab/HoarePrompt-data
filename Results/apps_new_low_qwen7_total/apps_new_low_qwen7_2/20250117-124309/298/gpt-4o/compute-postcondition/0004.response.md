The code `area = int(area)` converts the float value of `area` to an integer. Since `area` was already defined as an integer before this operation, converting it to an integer again does not change its value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is an integer**
