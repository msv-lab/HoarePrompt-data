The provided code block performs the following operations:

1. It prints the value of `n` followed by `m // 2`.
2. It prints `0` followed by `m // 2`.

These operations do not modify the values of any variables; they only perform output operations. Therefore, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `area` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is an integer,
- `m` is an integer,
- `k` is an integer,
- `area` is an integer not equal to 0,
- `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m` is false.

The final output state is the same as the initial state because no variables are updated.

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, area is an integer not equal to 0, and 2 * area is less than or equal to m is false**
