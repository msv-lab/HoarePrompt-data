Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, area is an integer not equal to 0, 2 * area is less than or equal to m**

Explanation:
The provided code consists of two print statements that do not modify any variables. The first print statement outputs `1 (2 * area)` and the second print statement outputs `1 0`. Since neither of these operations alters the values of the existing variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `area`), their values remain unchanged. The only constraint provided is that `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, which also remains true after the execution of the code.
