The function `func` accepts no parameters directly defined in the given code snippet. However, based on the constraints, it implies that the function should internally handle three integers: $n$, $m$, and $k$, where $1 \le n, m \le 10^9$ and $2 \le k \le 10^9$. The output cases are not specified directly within the function definition but are inferred from the problem statement.

Given the constraints and the lack of direct parameter definition in the function signature, the function's behavior is not fully specified here. Nonetheless, based on typical problem-solving approaches, we can infer the following:

- The function should process the integers $n$, $m$, and $k$.
- There are two possible return cases based on some condition related to these integers.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the integers $n$, $m$, and $k$ (not directly in the function parameters but implied by the constraints) and return a value based on specific conditions related to these integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts the integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) (with constraints \( 1 \le n, m \le 10^9 \) and \( 2 \le k \le 10^9 \)), and returns a value based on specific conditions related to these integers.**
