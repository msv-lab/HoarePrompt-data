Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are integers. If `area` is not an integer, the program prints 'NO'. If `area` equals 0, the state remains unchanged. If `area` does not equal 0 and `2 * area <= n`, the printed lines are '4 * area 1' and '0 1'. Otherwise, the condition `2 * area <= m` remains unchanged.***
