The code `print('NO')` does not affect any variables; it only prints a string. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is a float equal to (n * m) / k, and the current value of `area` is not an integer, and the program prints 'NO'**
