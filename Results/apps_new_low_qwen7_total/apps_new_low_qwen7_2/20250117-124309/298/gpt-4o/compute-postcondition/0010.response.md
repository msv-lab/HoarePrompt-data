Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, area is an integer not equal to 0, the current value of area satisfies 2 * area <= n, printed lines are '4 * area 1' and '0 1'**

Explanation:
- The first line of code prints the string `f'{2 * area} 1'`. Given that the initial condition is `2 * area <= n`, this statement is valid and will print `4 * area 1` (since `2 * area` is the current value of `2 * area`, which is less than or equal to `n`).
- The second line of code prints the string `f'0 1'`. This is a direct print statement and does not modify any variables.
- No variables are updated or assigned new values in these lines of code, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
- Therefore, the final state includes the printed lines and retains the initial conditions of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area`.
