Functionality: **The function accepts three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) (where \( 1 \le n, m \le 10^9 \) and \( 2 \le k \le 10^9 \)). It first calculates the value of \( area \) as \( \frac{n \times m}{k} \). If \( area \) is not an integer, the function prints 'NO' and exits. If \( area \) is zero, the function also prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

After that, the function prints one of four possible lines:
1. If \( 2 \times area \leq n \), it prints \( 2 \times area \) followed by 1.
2. If \( 2 \times area > n \) but \( 2 \times area \leq m \), it prints 1 followed by \( 2 \times area \).
3. If \( 2 \times area > m \), it prints \( n \) followed by \( \frac{m}{2} \).

The function does not return any value explicitly, but its primary output is the series of print statements it generates based on the input values and the calculated \( area \).**

This summary covers all the potential cases and actions performed by the function as described by both the code and the annotations.
