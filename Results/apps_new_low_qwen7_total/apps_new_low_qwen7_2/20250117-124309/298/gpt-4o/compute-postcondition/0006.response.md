The code prints 'NO', but this does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area`. The value of `area` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is 0**
