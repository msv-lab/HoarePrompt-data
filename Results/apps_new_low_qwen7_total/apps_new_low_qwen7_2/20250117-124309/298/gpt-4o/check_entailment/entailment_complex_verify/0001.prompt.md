You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) (where \( 1 \le n, m \le 10^9 \) and \( 2 \le k \le 10^9 \)). It first calculates the value of \( area \) as \( \frac{n \times m}{k} \). If \( area \) is not an integer, the function prints 'NO' and exits. If \( area \) is zero, the function also prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

After that, the function prints one of four possible lines:
1. If \( 2 \times area \leq n \), it prints \( 2 \times area \) followed by 1.
2. If \( 2 \times area > n \) but \( 2 \times area \leq m \), it prints 1 followed by \( 2 \times area \).
3. If \( 2 \times area > m \), it prints \( n \) followed by \( \frac{m}{2} \).

The function does not return any value explicitly, but its primary output is the series of print statements it generates based on the input values and the calculated \( area \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The program correctly checks if \( \text{area} = \frac{nm}{k} \) is an integer.
   - If it's not an integer, it prints 'NO', which is correct because a triangle's area must be an integer.

2. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area calculation is done correctly as `area = n * m / k`.
   - The subsequent check if `area` is an integer using `int(area)` is also correct.

3. **Handling Zero Area**:
   - If the area is zero, the program correctly identifies this as impossible to form a triangle and prints 'NO'.
   
4. **Constructing Points**:
   - For non-zero area, the program attempts to construct points.
   - It checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \) and constructs points accordingly.
   - Similarly, it checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \).
   - If neither condition is met, it uses \( (n, \frac{m}{2}) \), \( (0, \frac{m}{2}) \), and \( (0, 0) \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the basic conditions where the area fits within the grid dimensions.
   - However, the logic for constructing points does not guarantee a valid triangle in all cases. Specifically, the chosen points may not always form a valid triangle with the required area.

6. **Triangle Formation**:
   - To ensure the points form a valid triangle with the specified area, the points need to satisfy the triangle inequality and the area formula.
   - The current approach might fail for certain values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) due to the specific construction of points.

### Conclusion:

The program does handle the basic conditions correctly but fails to guarantee that the constructed points will always form a valid triangle with the required area in all cases. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

### Correctness:

**False**
