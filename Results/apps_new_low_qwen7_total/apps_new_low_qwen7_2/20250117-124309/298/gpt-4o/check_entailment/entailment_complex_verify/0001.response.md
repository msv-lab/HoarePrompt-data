### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The program correctly checks if \( \text{area} = \frac{nm}{k} \) is an integer.
   - If it's not an integer, it prints 'NO', which is correct because a triangle's area must be an integer.

2. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area calculation is done correctly as `area = n * m / k`.
   - The subsequent check if `area` is an integer using `int(area)` is also correct.

3. **Handling Zero Area**:
   - If the area is zero, the program correctly identifies this as impossible to form a triangle and prints 'NO'.

4. **Constructing Points**:
   - For non-zero area, the program attempts to construct points.
   - It checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \) and constructs points accordingly.
   - Similarly, it checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \).
   - If neither condition is met, it uses \( (n, \frac{m}{2}) \), \( (0, \frac{m}{2}) \), and \( (0, 0) \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the basic conditions where the area fits within the grid dimensions.
   - However, the logic for constructing points does not guarantee a valid triangle in all cases. Specifically, the chosen points may not always form a valid triangle with the required area.

6. **Triangle Formation**:
   - To ensure the points form a valid triangle with the specified area, the points need to satisfy the triangle inequality and the area formula.
   - The current approach might fail for certain values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) due to the specific construction of points.

### Analysis Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: \( n, m, k \) are read from input, and `area` is calculated as \( \frac{nm}{k} \).
- **Area Check**: If `area` is not an integer, it prints 'NO' and exits.
- **Zero Area**: If `area` is zero, it prints 'NO' and exits.
- **Non-Zero Area**:
  - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \), it prints points that might not necessarily form a valid triangle.
  - If \( 2 \times \text{area} > n \) but \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \), it prints another set of points.
  - If \( 2 \times \text{area} > m \), it prints points that might not necessarily form a valid triangle either.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Correctness of Triangle Area**:
   - The program correctly ensures that the area is an integer and non-zero.
   - However, the construction of points does not always guarantee that the area of the triangle formed by these points is exactly \( \frac{nm}{k} \).

2. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input \( (4, 3, 3) \), the area is \( 4 \), and the points \( (1, 0) \), \( (2, 3) \), \( (4, 1) \) indeed form a triangle with area 4.
   - For the input \( (4, 4, 7) \), the area is \( \frac{16}{7} \), which is not an integer, so it prints 'NO'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the area is zero or not an integer.
   - However, for certain configurations of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), the constructed points might not form a valid triangle.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the basic conditions but fails to guarantee that the constructed points will always form a valid triangle with the required area in all cases. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
