Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the coordinates of the points does not always ensure that the area of the triangle is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

For instance, consider the input \( n = 5 \), \( m = 5 \), and \( k = 2 \). The required area of the triangle should be \(\frac{25}{2} = 12.5\), which is not an integer. However, the program checks if the area is an integer and prints 'NO' if it is not. This is correct for this specific case.

But consider another case, \( n = 5 \), \( m = 5 \), and \( k = 3 \). The required area of the triangle should be \(\frac{25}{3} \approx 8.33\), which is not an integer, so the program should also print 'NO'. However, the program mistakenly tries to proceed and calculates coordinates based on an integer value, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the area calculation is handled correctly for non-integer areas and should explicitly handle the case where \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is not an integer by printing 'NO'.
