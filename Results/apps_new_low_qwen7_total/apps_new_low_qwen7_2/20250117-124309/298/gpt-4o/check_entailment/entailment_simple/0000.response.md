Reasoning:
1. The program correctly checks if the area \( \text{area} = \frac{nm}{k} \) is an integer. If it is not, it prints "NO" which is correct according to the problem statement.
2. If the area is an integer, it further checks if the area is zero. If it is zero, it prints "NO" because a triangle with zero area cannot exist, which is correct.
3. If the area is non-zero, it attempts to print coordinates for three points forming a triangle with the required area.
   - It first tries to place two points at \((2 \cdot \text{area}, 1)\) and \((0, 1)\), which might work under certain conditions.
   - If the above placement fails, it tries to place two points at \((1, 2 \cdot \text{area})\) and \((0, 1)\).
   - If both of the above placements fail, it places the points at \((n, m // 2)\) and \((0, m // 2)\).

However, the logic for the placement of the points needs to be more robust to ensure that they form a triangle with the exact required area. Specifically, the chosen points must satisfy the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\):

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right| \]

Given the problem constraints, this simpler approach may not always yield the correct points. A more rigorous geometric check is needed to ensure the area calculation is correct.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not guarantee the formation of a triangle with the exact required area due to the simple coordinate placements without verifying the actual area calculation. Therefore, the program might sometimes produce invalid solutions or fail to find a valid solution when one exists.
