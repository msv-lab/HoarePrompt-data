### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The program correctly checks if \( \text{area} = \frac{nm}{k} \) is an integer.
   - If it's not an integer, it prints 'NO', which is correct because a triangle's area must be an integer.

2. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area calculation is done correctly as `area = n * m / k`.
   - The subsequent check if `area` is an integer using `int(area)` is also correct.

3. **Handling Zero Area**:
   - If the area is zero, the program correctly identifies this as impossible to form a triangle and prints 'NO'.
   
4. **Constructing Points**:
   - For non-zero area, the program attempts to construct points.
   - It checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \) and constructs points accordingly.
   - Similarly, it checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \).
   - If neither condition is met, it uses \( (n, \frac{m}{2}) \), \( (0, \frac{m}{2}) \), and \( (0, 0) \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the basic conditions where the area fits within the grid dimensions.
   - However, the logic for constructing points does not guarantee a valid triangle in all cases. Specifically, the chosen points may not always form a valid triangle with the required area.

6. **Triangle Formation**:
   - To ensure the points form a valid triangle with the specified area, the points need to satisfy the triangle inequality and the area formula.
   - The current approach might fail for certain values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) due to the specific construction of points.

### Conclusion:

The program does handle the basic conditions correctly but fails to guarantee that the constructed points will always form a valid triangle with the required area in all cases. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

### Correctness:

**False**
