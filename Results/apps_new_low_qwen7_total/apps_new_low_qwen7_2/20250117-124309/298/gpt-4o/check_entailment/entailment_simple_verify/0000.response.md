### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotated code and the examples given in the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the input.
   - It calculates the area of the triangle as \( \text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k} \).
   - It checks if the area is an integer. If not, it prints "NO" immediately, which is correct because if the area is not an integer, no integer coordinates can form a triangle with that exact area.

2. **Integer Area Check:**
   - If the area is an integer, it proceeds to check if the area is zero. If it is, it prints "NO" again, which is correct because a triangle with zero area is not possible.

3. **Non-Zero Integer Area:**
   - If the area is a positive integer, it prints "YES".
   - The program then attempts to print the coordinates of the triangle vertices. However, the logic used to determine these coordinates is flawed.

4. **Coordinate Calculation Logic:**
   - The program tries to place one vertex at the origin (0, 0).
   - It then tries to place the other two vertices along the axes.
   - Specifically, it checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \) or \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \).
   - If both conditions fail, it places the vertices at \( (n, \frac{m}{2}) \) and \( (0, \frac{m}{2}) \).

### Issues with the Coordinate Calculation:

1. **Incorrect Placement of Vertices:**
   - The program assumes that placing one vertex at (0, 0) and another at (2*area, 1) or (1, 2*area) will always work. However, this is not guaranteed.
   - For example, consider \( n = 5 \), \( m = 5 \), and \( k = 3 \). The area is \( \frac{25}{3} \approx 8.33 \), which is not an integer. The program should print "NO" but instead tries to calculate coordinates, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Handling Non-Integer Areas:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the case where the area is not an integer. It should print "NO" immediately when the area is not an integer, but it tries to calculate coordinates based on an approximate integer value, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where the area is not an integer and provides incorrect coordinates when the area is an integer. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
