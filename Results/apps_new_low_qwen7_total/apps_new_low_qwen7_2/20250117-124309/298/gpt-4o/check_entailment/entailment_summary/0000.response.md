Reasoning:
- The program correctly checks if the area is an integer and if it is non-zero. If not, it prints "NO" as expected.
- For a non-zero integer area, the program then attempts to generate a triangle with vertices at specific points based on the calculated area. 
- The logic for generating the coordinates of the triangle points seems to cover most scenarios where the area is an integer and non-zero.
- However, the execution summary mentions four possible outputs from the function, but the code only covers three cases:
  1. When \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\)
  2. When \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) but \(2 \times \text{area} \leq m\)
  3. When \(2 \times \text{area} > m\)

- The fourth case (when neither condition for \(n\) nor \(m\) is met, which theoretically should not happen since the area would have been checked to fit within \(n\) and \(m\)) is not handled.

Given this, while the program handles most cases effectively, it fails to cover the theoretical edge case, which means it might not always produce a valid solution for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
