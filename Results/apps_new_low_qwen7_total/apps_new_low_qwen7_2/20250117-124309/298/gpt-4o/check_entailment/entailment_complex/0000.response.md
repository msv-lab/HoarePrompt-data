Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the input.
2. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area of the triangle as \( \frac{n \times m}{k} \) and checks if this area is an integer. This is necessary because the area of a triangle must be an integer for the problem constraints.
3. **Zero Area Check**: If the calculated area is zero, the program correctly prints "NO" because the area cannot be zero for valid \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) (since \( 1 \le n, m \le 10^9 \) and \( 2 \le k \le 10^9 \)).
4. **Non-integer Area Check**: If the area is not an integer, the program correctly prints "NO".
5. **Coordinate Calculation**: The program attempts to find valid coordinates for the points based on the area:
   - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \), it sets \( x_2 = 2 \times \text{area} \) and \( y_2 = 1 \).
   - If \( 2 \times \text{area} > n \) but \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \), it sets \( x_2 = 1 \) and \( y_2 = 2 \times \text{area} \).
   - If \( 2 \times \text{area} > m \), it sets \( x_2 = n \) and \( y_2 = \frac{m}{2} \).
6. **Output**: The program prints "YES" followed by the calculated coordinates.

However, there are some logical errors in the coordinate assignments and the overall logic flow:
- The coordinates assigned might not always form a triangle with the required area, especially when the area calculation is not handled properly.
- The current implementation does not ensure that the three points will form a triangle with the specified area.

To ensure correctness, the coordinates need to be verified against the area formula for a triangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} | x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) | \]

Given the complexity of the problem, a more robust approach would involve checking all possible configurations of the points to ensure they form the correct area.

Based on the current implementation, the logic does not fully guarantee that the points will form the required area.

Correctness: **False**
