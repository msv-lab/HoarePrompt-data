Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: $n$, $m$, and $k$ are integers such that $1 \le n, m \le 10^9$ and $2 \le k \le 10^9$.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')

print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')

print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')

print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')

print(f'0 {m // 2}')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are integers, and `area` is not equal to 0. If `2 * area <= m`, then the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition `2 * area <= m` is false.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are integers, and `area` is not equal to 0. If `2 * area <= n`, then the printed lines are '4 * area 1' and '0 1'. Otherwise, the condition `2 * area <= m` remains unchanged.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are integers. If `area` equals 0, the state remains unchanged. If `area` does not equal 0, and `2 * area <= n`, then the printed lines are '4 * area 1' and '0 1'. Otherwise, the condition `2 * area <= m` remains unchanged.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are integers. If `area` is not an integer, the program prints 'NO'. If `area` equals 0, the state remains unchanged. If `area` does not equal 0 and `2 * area <= n`, the printed lines are '4 * area 1' and '0 1'. Otherwise, the condition `2 * area <= m` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) (where \( 1 \le n, m \le 10^9 \) and \( 2 \le k \le 10^9 \)). It first calculates the value of \( area \) as \( \frac{n \times m}{k} \). If \( area \) is not an integer, the function prints 'NO' and exits. If \( area \) is zero, the function also prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

After that, the function prints one of four possible lines:
1. If \( 2 \times area \leq n \), it prints \( 2 \times area \) followed by 1.
2. If \( 2 \times area > n \) but \( 2 \times area \leq m \), it prints 1 followed by \( 2 \times area \).
3. If \( 2 \times area > m \), it prints \( n \) followed by \( \frac{m}{2} \).

The function does not return any value explicitly, but its primary output is the series of print statements it generates based on the input values and the calculated \( area \).
