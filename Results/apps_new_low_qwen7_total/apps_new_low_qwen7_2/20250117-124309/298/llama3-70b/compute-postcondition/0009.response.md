Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates, the function returns a tuple where the first element is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and the second element is `0`. This covers all potential edge cases where `a` and `b` are positive integers.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `a` or `b` is 1, the function correctly returns `(1, 0)` since the GCD of any number and 1 is 1.
- If `a` and `b` are equal, the function correctly returns `(a, 0)` because the GCD of two identical numbers is the number itself.
- If either `a` or `b` is 0, the function still works correctly, returning the non-zero value as the GCD and 0. However, typically, `a` and `b` are assumed to be positive, so this case might not be explicitly handled in the code, but it still works correctly within the given assumptions.
