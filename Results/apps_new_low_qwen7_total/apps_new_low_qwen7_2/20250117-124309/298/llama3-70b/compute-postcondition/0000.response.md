The function `func_2(a, b)` is called with `a` and `b` as arguments, and it returns two values `x` and `y`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Without knowing the implementation of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, we can only state that `x` and `y` are the return values of `func_2(a, b)`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, `y` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`**
