The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers. The function returns a tuple where the first element is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`, and the second element is `0`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers, and returns a tuple where the first element is the GCD of `a` and `b`, and the second element is `0`.**
