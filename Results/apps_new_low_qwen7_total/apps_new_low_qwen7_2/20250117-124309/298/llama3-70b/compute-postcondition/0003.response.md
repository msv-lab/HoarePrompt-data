Functionality: **The function `func_3(a, b)` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, both within the range [1, 10^9], and another integer parameter `k` which is not explicitly used in the function. It calls the function `func_2(a, b)` twice to obtain values `x` and `y`. These values `x` and `y` are then returned along with the computed value of `x * a + y * b`. The function ensures that `x` and `y` are the results of `func_2(a, b)`, even though the specific operation performed by `func_2` is not detailed here. The function does not handle any edge cases related to the input values of `a`, `b`, or `k` beyond the initial constraints.**

Note: The annotation mentions `k` but it is not used in the function, so no specific action is taken with `k`. Also, no missing functionality was identified based on the provided code and annotations.
