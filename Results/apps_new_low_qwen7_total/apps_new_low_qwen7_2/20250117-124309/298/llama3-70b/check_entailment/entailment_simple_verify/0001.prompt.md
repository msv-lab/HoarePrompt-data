You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

- Annotated Code:

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)

    print(0, 0)

    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: a is the GCD of the original a and b, b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the GCD of the original a and b, and b, which is 0

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(b \neq 0\).
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #`The program returns y and x - a // b * y, where x and y are the return values from func_2(b, a % b)`

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing n and m respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #`x` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, `y` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, and the program returns `x, y, (x * a + y * b)`




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: 
   - The problem requires finding three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) within the grid defined by \(0 \le x_i \le n\) and \(0 \le y_i \le m\).
   - The area of the triangle formed by these points should be \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

2. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) can be calculated using the determinant formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
     \]
   - For the area to be exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\), we need:
     \[
     \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right| = \frac{2nm}{k}
     \]

3. **GCD and Bezout's Identity**:
   - The program includes functions for calculating GCD (greatest common divisor) and solving linear Diophantine equations.
   - `func_1` computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2` uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
   - `func_3` returns the coefficients and a linear combination of \(a\) and \(b\).

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The key challenge is ensuring that \(\frac{nm}{k}\) can be expressed as an integer value that can be achieved by the area formula.
   - If \(\text{gcd}(n, m)\) does not divide \(k\), it might be impossible to form such a triangle with the given area.

5. **Implementation Review**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the necessary mathematical operations but lacks logic to directly check the feasibility of forming the required triangle.
   - The output handling is also missing. The code needs to verify if the area condition can be satisfied and then generate appropriate points if possible.

### Conclusion:
- Based on the problem description and the given code, the program needs additional logic to check if the area condition can be satisfied and to generate the points accordingly.
- However, the core mathematical functions (GCD and Diophantine equation solver) are correctly implemented.

Given the current state of the program, it does not fully address the problem requirements, but the mathematical foundations are sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program as provided is:

**Correctness: False**

The program needs further implementation to handle the problem constraints and provide the correct output.
