### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Initial Analysis:
1. **Helper Functions:**
   - `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2` uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
   - `func_3` combines the results of `func_2` to solve the equation \(ax + by = c\).

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program first reads the input values \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It checks if \(nm \mod k\) is zero. If not, it prints "NO" and exits, as the area condition cannot be satisfied.
   - It then calls `func_3` with \(n\) and \(m\) to get the GCD and the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\).
   - If the product of \(n1\) and \(m1\) is greater than or equal to the GCD \(g\), it prints "YES" and outputs the coordinates of the points.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Key Points:**
   - The core of the solution lies in ensuring the area of the triangle can be formed. This involves using the coefficients from `func_2` and checking if the product of \(n1\) and \(m1\) meets the requirement.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **GCD Computation:**
   - The `func_1` and `func_2` functions are correctly implemented and used to compute the GCD of \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - `func_3` uses the results from `func_2` to find the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(nx + my = \text{gcd}(n, m)\). However, the actual use of these coefficients is not immediately clear from the problem statement. We need to verify how these coefficients are used to form the triangle.

3. **Area Calculation:**
   - The area of the triangle is given by \(\frac{nm}{k}\). For the triangle to exist, \(nm\) must be divisible by \(k\), which is checked correctly.
   - The coordinates \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 * m // g)\), and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\) are derived from the GCD and the coefficients, but we need to verify if these points indeed form a triangle with the required area.

4. **Verification of Triangle Formation:**
   - The coordinates \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 * m // g)\), and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\) are chosen such that they form a right-angled triangle with the base along the x-axis and height along the y-axis.
   - The area of this triangle is calculated as \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times (m1 * m // g) \times (n1 * m // g)\).
   - Simplifying, the area becomes \(\frac{1}{2} \times \left(\frac{m1 \cdot m}{g}\right) \times \left(\frac{n1 \cdot m}{g}\right) = \frac{m1 \cdot n1 \cdot m^2}{2g^2}\).

Given that \(g = \text{gcd}(n, m)\), the simplified area should match \(\frac{nm}{k}\). However, the program does not directly check if the derived points indeed satisfy this condition.

#### Conclusion:
The program logic seems to be attempting to find a valid set of points, but the implementation and verification steps are not fully aligned with the problem requirements. The use of the GCD and the derived points might not guarantee the correct area without further validation.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate because the implementation does not fully address the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
