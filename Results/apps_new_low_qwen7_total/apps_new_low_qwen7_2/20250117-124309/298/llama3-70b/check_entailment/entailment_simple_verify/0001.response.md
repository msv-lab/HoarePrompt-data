### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) within the grid defined by \(0 \le x_i \le n\) and \(0 \le y_i \le m\).
   - The area of the triangle formed by these points should be \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

2. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) can be calculated using the determinant formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
     \]
   - For the area to be exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\), we need:
     \[
     \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right| = \frac{2nm}{k}
     \]

3. **GCD and Bezout's Identity**:
   - The program includes functions for calculating GCD (greatest common divisor) and solving linear Diophantine equations.
   - `func_1` computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2` uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
   - `func_3` returns the coefficients and a linear combination of \(a\) and \(b\).

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The key challenge is ensuring that \(\frac{nm}{k}\) can be expressed as an integer value that can be achieved by the area formula.
   - If \(\text{gcd}(n, m)\) does not divide \(k\), it might be impossible to form such a triangle with the given area.

5. **Implementation Review**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the necessary mathematical operations but lacks logic to directly check the feasibility of forming the required triangle.
   - The output handling is also missing. The code needs to verify if the area condition can be satisfied and then generate appropriate points if possible.
   - The annotated code provides a good insight into how the functions work, but it doesn't fully cover the logic needed to solve the problem.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: Returns the coefficients and a linear combination of \(a\) and \(b\).

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **Initial Input Handling**:
  ```python
  (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
  if n * m % k:
      print('NO')
      exit()
  ```
  - This checks if \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is an integer. If not, it prints "NO" and exits. This step is correct.

- **Finding Suitable Points**:
  ```python
  (n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
  ```
  - `func_3` returns the coefficients and a linear combination of \(n\) and \(m\), but it doesn't ensure that the points will form a triangle with the required area. The logic to determine suitable points is missing.

- **Area Condition Check**:
  ```python
  if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
      print('YES')
      print(0, 0)
      print(0, n1 * m // g)
      print(m1 * m // g, 0)
  else:
      print('NO')
  ```
  - The code assumes that the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, \frac{n1 \cdot m}{g})\), and \((\frac{m1 \cdot m}{g}, 0)\) will always form a valid triangle with the required area. This assumption is incorrect because it doesn't account for the area formula and the specific values of \(x_i\) and \(y_i\).

### Conclusion:
- The program currently lacks the necessary logic to correctly determine if the points can form a triangle with the required area. It also doesn't properly generate the points once the feasibility is confirmed.
- The core mathematical functions are implemented correctly, but the overall structure and logic are insufficient to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated.
