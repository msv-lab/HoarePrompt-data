### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: 
   - The problem requires finding three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) within the grid defined by \(0 \le x_i \le n\) and \(0 \le y_i \le m\).
   - The area of the triangle formed by these points should be \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

2. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) can be calculated using the determinant formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
     \]
   - For the area to be exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\), we need:
     \[
     \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right| = \frac{2nm}{k}
     \]

3. **GCD and Bezout's Identity**:
   - The program includes functions for calculating GCD (greatest common divisor) and solving linear Diophantine equations.
   - `func_1` computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2` uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
   - `func_3` returns the coefficients and a linear combination of \(a\) and \(b\).

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The key challenge is ensuring that \(\frac{nm}{k}\) can be expressed as an integer value that can be achieved by the area formula.
   - If \(\text{gcd}(n, m)\) does not divide \(k\), it might be impossible to form such a triangle with the given area.

5. **Implementation Review**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the necessary mathematical operations but lacks logic to directly check the feasibility of forming the required triangle.
   - The output handling is also missing. The code needs to verify if the area condition can be satisfied and then generate appropriate points if possible.

### Conclusion:
- Based on the problem description and the given code, the program needs additional logic to check if the area condition can be satisfied and to generate the points accordingly.
- However, the core mathematical functions (GCD and Diophantine equation solver) are correctly implemented.

Given the current state of the program, it does not fully address the problem requirements, but the mathematical foundations are sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program as provided is:

**Correctness: False**

The program needs further implementation to handle the problem constraints and provide the correct output.
