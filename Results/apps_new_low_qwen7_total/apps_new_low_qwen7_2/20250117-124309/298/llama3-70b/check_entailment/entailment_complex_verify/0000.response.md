### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided annotated code step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Given three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), we need to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
- \( 0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n \)
- \( 0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m \)
- The area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

#### Key Observations from Annotated Code:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   
2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Uses a recursive approach to compute the coefficients \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \).
   
3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - Uses the results from `func_2` to compute \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b \).

4. **Main Logic:**
   - Checks if \( nm \% k \) is zero. If not, prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, computes the GCD of \( n \) and \( m \) using `func_3`.
   - If the product of one coordinate and the other divided by the GCD is greater than or equal to the GCD, it prints "YES" and the required coordinates.
   - Otherwise, prints "NO".

#### Detailed Analysis:
- The GCD of \( n \) and \( m \) is computed using `func_3`, which effectively finds the coefficients \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( nx + my = \text{gcd}(n, m) \).
- The logic checks if the area condition can be satisfied by constructing a triangle with vertices at \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 * m // g)\), and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\), where \( g \) is the GCD.
- This construction ensures that the area of the triangle is \(\frac{nm}{k}\), as required.

#### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the GCD computation and checks the area condition.
- The logic for generating the points is valid and ensures the area condition is met.
- The edge cases where \( nm \% k \neq 0 \) are handled appropriately by printing "NO".

Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate**. The provided program does indeed solve the problem correctly by computing the necessary GCD and checking the area condition.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
