### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle they form is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
   - The area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
     \]
   - For the area to be \(\frac{nm}{k}\), we need:
     \[
     \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right| = \frac{2nm}{k}
     \]

2. **Key Observations**:
   - To form a triangle with the desired area, the determinant must be an integer multiple of \(\frac{2nm}{k}\).
   - We can use the GCD and extended GCD functions to ensure that the area condition can be met.

3. **GCD and Extended GCD Functions**:
   - `func_1` correctly computes the GCD of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - `func_2` and `func_3` correctly solve the linear Diophantine equation \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The program checks if \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is an integer and if the GCD divides \(k\). If \(\text{gcd}(n, m)\) does not divide \(k\), it prints "NO".
   - If the conditions are met, it generates points using the coefficients from the extended GCD and the area condition.

5. **Implementation Review**:
   - The program correctly checks the feasibility and generates the points if possible.
   - The logic to generate the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 * m // g)\), and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\) ensures that the area condition is satisfied.

6. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code shows that the program handles the problem correctly. It checks if the area condition can be satisfied and generates appropriate points if possible.
   - The program outputs "NO" when it cannot form the triangle, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles the problem constraints and provides the correct output. It checks if the area condition can be met and generates the points if possible.

Given the current state of the program, it fully addresses the problem requirements and correctly implements the necessary logic.

**Final: True**
