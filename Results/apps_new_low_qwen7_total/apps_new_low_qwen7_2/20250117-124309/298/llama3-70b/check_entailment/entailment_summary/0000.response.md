Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic step-by-step and ensure it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Check if Area is an Integer**: 
   - The first check in the code is to verify if \( nm \% k == 0 \). If this condition is not met, it means the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) cannot be an integer, and thus, no triangle with that area exists. Therefore, the program correctly prints "NO" and exits.

2. **Finding Suitable Points**:
   - The program then calculates \((n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)\). Here, \(g\) is likely the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(n\) and \(m\), as indicated by the function `func_3` and the output hints of `func_2`.
   - Next, the program checks if \(|n1 \times m| \ge g\). If this condition is met, it implies that the area requirement can be satisfied using the calculated values. If so, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 \times m // g)\), and \((m1 \times m // g, 0)\).
   - If the condition \(|n1 \times m| < g\) is not met, it means the required area cannot be achieved with the given dimensions, and the program prints "NO".

Let's break down the logic further:

- **Area Calculation**: The area of the triangle formed by the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 \times m // g)\), and \((m1 \times m // g, 0)\) is indeed \(\frac{nm}{k}\):
  - The base of the triangle is \(n1 \times m // g\).
  - The height of the triangle is \(m1 \times m // g\).
  - The area of the triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times (n1 \times m // g) \times (m1 \times m // g) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{n \times m}{g} = \frac{nm}{k}\).

Since all steps follow the logic correctly and ensure that the area requirement is met when possible, the program appears to be logically sound.

Correctness: **True**
