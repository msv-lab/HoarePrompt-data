Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to find three integer points such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The area of a triangle formed by points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) can be calculated using the determinant formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
   \]
   To satisfy the condition, we need:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right| = \frac{nm}{k}
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right| = \frac{2nm}{k}
   \]

2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The program uses Euclid's algorithm to compute the GCD (function `func_1`).
   - Function `func_2` computes Bezout's coefficients.
   - Function `func_3` combines the results to find a solution to the linear Diophantine equation \(ax + by = g\).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\). If not, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - If \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\), it proceeds to use the GCD and Bezout's coefficients to find suitable points.
   - If the calculated area condition is met, it prints "YES" and the coordinates of the points.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Detailed Check**:
   - The code correctly handles the divisibility check and the GCD calculation.
   - The coordinates chosen for the points are derived using the GCD and Bezout's coefficients, ensuring they satisfy the area requirement.

Given the analysis, the annotated program logically addresses the problem and provides a valid solution if it exists. Therefore, the program is correct.
