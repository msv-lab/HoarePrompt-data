Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

# Annotated Program:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: a is the GCD of the original a and b, b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the GCD of the original a and b, and b, which is 0

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(b \neq 0\).
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #`The program returns y and x - a // b * y, where x and y are the return values from func_2(b, a % b)`

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing n and m respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #`x` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, `y` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, and the program returns `x, y, (x * a + y * b)`
