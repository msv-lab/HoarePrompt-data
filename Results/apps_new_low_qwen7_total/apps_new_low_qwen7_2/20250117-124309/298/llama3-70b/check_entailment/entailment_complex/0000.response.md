### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The task is to find three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle they form equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
   - Given the formula for the area of a triangle formed by three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) is \(\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\), we need to ensure this equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For the area to be an integer, \(\frac{nm}{k}\) must be an integer. Hence, \(nm \mod k = 0\).
   - If \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is an integer, we need to find a way to form a triangle with this area.

3. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code first checks if \(nm \mod k = 0\). If not, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - If \(nm \mod k = 0\), it proceeds to use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (implemented in `func_2`) to find integers \(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2\) such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
   - The function `func_3` uses the result from `func_2` to calculate \(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2\) and their linear combination, which is used to form the required area.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - `func_2` correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, ensuring the equation \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\) holds.
   - `func_3` uses the results of `func_2` to construct the points and the linear combination, which is necessary to achieve the required area.
   - The main logic checks if the computed area matches \(\frac{nm}{k}\) and prints the appropriate response.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where \(nm \mod k \neq 0\) by printing "NO".
   - The construction of points and the verification of the area calculation are correctly implemented.

Given the above analysis, the code correctly solves the problem according to the given constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
