Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

# Annotated Functions:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)

    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: a is the GCD of the original a and b, b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the GCD of the original a and b, and b, which is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates, the function returns a tuple where the first element is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and the second element is `0`. This covers all potential edge cases where `a` and `b` are positive integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(b \neq 0\).
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #`The program returns y and x - a // b * y, where x and y are the return values from func_2(b, a % b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(b \neq 0\). It uses a recursive approach to compute the extended greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Specifically, it returns the values `(x, y)` such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).

- If `b == 0`, the function directly returns `(1, 0)`, which corresponds to the base case where the GCD is `a` itself, and `x` and `y` can be set to 1 and 0 respectively to satisfy the equation \(a*1 + 0*0 = a\).
- For other cases, the function recursively calls itself with arguments `(b, a % b)` and computes the values `(x, y)` from the recursive call. Then, it returns `(y, x - a // b * y)`, ensuring that the equation \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\) holds true.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing n and m respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #`x` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, `y` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, and the program returns `x, y, (x * a + y * b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3(a, b)` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, both within the range [1, 10^9], and another integer parameter `k` which is not explicitly used in the function. It calls the function `func_2(a, b)` twice to obtain values `x` and `y`. These values `x` and `y` are then returned along with the computed value of `x * a + y * b`. The function ensures that `x` and `y` are the results of `func_2(a, b)`, even though the specific operation performed by `func_2` is not detailed here. The function does not handle any edge cases related to the input values of `a`, `b`, or `k` beyond the initial constraints.
