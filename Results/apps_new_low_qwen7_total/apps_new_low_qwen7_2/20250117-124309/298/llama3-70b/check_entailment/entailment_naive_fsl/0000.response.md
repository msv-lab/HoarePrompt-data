Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program only includes three helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) without a main function that addresses the problem description. These functions do not relate to solving the problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and will not work correctly for the given inputs.
