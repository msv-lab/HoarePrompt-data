### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not contain a main function that solves the problem. However, let's analyze the helper functions and see if they can be used to solve the problem.

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It works correctly and efficiently.

2. **Function `func_2(a, b)`**: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \gcd(a, b)\). This is useful for solving linear Diophantine equations.

3. **Function `func_3(a, b)`**: This function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, along with the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) found by `func_2(a, b)`. Additionally, it returns the linear combination \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = \gcd(a, b)\).

To solve the problem, we need to find three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) can be calculated using the determinant formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|. \]

We need this area to be equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). One approach is to choose the points in such a way that the area condition is satisfied. For example, we can choose the points \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), and \((0, m)\). The area of the triangle formed by these points is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(0 - m) + n(m - 0) + 0(0 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} nm. \]

To make the area exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\), we can scale the coordinates appropriately. Specifically, we can choose the points \((0, 0)\), \((kn, 0)\), and \((0, km)\). The area of the triangle formed by these points is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(0 - km) + kn(km - 0) + 0(0 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} knm = \frac{nm}{2}. \]

However, since we need the exact area \(\frac{nm}{k}\), we can use the GCD and the coefficients from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find suitable coordinates. The function `func_3(a, b)` can help us find the necessary coefficients.

Given the problem constraints, we can use the following strategy:
1. Compute \(\gcd(n, m)\).
2. Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find coefficients that satisfy the area condition.

Here is a possible implementation:

```python
def find_points(n, m, k):
    # Compute gcd of n and m
    gcd_nm = func_1(n, m)
    
    # Ensure k divides nm/gcd_nm
    if (n * m) % (k * gcd_nm) != 0:
        return "NO"
    
    # Find coefficients using Extended Euclidean Algorithm
    x, y, _ = func_3(n, m)
    
    # Scale the points to satisfy the area condition
    x1, y1 = 0, 0
    x2, y2 = k * n, 0
    x3, y3 = 0, k * m
    
    return "YES\n{} {} \n{} {} \n{} {}".format(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)

# Example usage
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
print(find_points(n, m, k))
```

This approach uses the helper functions to compute the necessary points. Since the problem requires finding such points and the provided functions can be used to achieve this, the original assessment is inaccurate.
