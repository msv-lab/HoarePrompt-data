#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: a is the GCD of the original a and b, b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the GCD of the original a and b, and b, which is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates, the function returns a tuple where the first element is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and the second element is `0`. This covers all potential edge cases where `a` and `b` are positive integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(b \neq 0\).
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #`The program returns y and x - a // b * y, where x and y are the return values from func_2(b, a % b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(b \neq 0\). It uses a recursive approach to compute the extended greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Specifically, it returns the values `(x, y)` such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).

- If `b == 0`, the function directly returns `(1, 0)`, which corresponds to the base case where the GCD is `a` itself, and `x` and `y` can be set to 1 and 0 respectively to satisfy the equation \(a*1 + 0*0 = a\).
- For other cases, the function recursively calls itself with arguments `(b, a % b)` and computes the values `(x, y)` from the recursive call. Then, it returns `(y, x - a // b * y)`, ensuring that the equation \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\) holds true.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing n and m respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #`x` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, `y` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, and the program returns `x, y, (x * a + y * b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3(a, b)` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, both within the range [1, 10^9], and another integer parameter `k` which is not explicitly used in the function. It calls the function `func_2(a, b)` twice to obtain values `x` and `y`. These values `x` and `y` are then returned along with the computed value of `x * a + y * b`. The function ensures that `x` and `y` are the results of `func_2(a, b)`, even though the specific operation performed by `func_2` is not detailed here. The function does not handle any edge cases related to the input values of `a`, `b`, or `k` beyond the initial constraints.
