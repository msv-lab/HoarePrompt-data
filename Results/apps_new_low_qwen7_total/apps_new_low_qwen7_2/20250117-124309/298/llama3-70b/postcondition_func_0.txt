The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates, the function returns a tuple where the first element is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and the second element is `0`. This covers all potential edge cases where `a` and `b` are positive integers.
