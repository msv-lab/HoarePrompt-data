To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to run.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer representing a number within the range from \( l \) to \( r \).
   - `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \).
   - `dp` is a dictionary used for memoization where keys are tuples of (number, k) and values are integers.
   - `dp[n, k] = 9`.
   - The value of `k` is not equal to 0.
   - Additionally, \((n, k)\) is not in `dp`.
   - \( n \ge 10^k \).

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The loop runs for `i` starting from 1 up to `k-1`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1 because the loop starts with `i = 1`.

4. **Conditions for the First Iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the only condition that needs to be met for the loop to execute the first time is that `i` should be 1.
   - The value of `k` itself does not directly control the loop's first execution since the loop's range is already defined as `range(1, k)`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - The variables `n`, `k`, and `dp` do not affect the first iteration of the loop directly. They are just initialized and their values are not modified inside the loop.

Given the above analysis, the only thing that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time is that `i` must be 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 9, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range from \( l \) to \( r \), `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \), `dp` is a dictionary where `dp[n, k] = 9`, the value of `k` is not equal to 0, \((n, k)\) is not in `dp`, and \( n \ge 10^k \)**.
