Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing a number within the range from \( l \) to \( r \), `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \), and `dp` is a dictionary used for memoization where keys are tuples of (number, k) and values are integers. The value of `k` is not equal to 0. The condition `(n, k)` is present in the dictionary `dp`.**
