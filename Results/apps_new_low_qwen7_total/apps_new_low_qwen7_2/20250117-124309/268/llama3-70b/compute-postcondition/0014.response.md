Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `total` is 9
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer within the range from \( l \) to \( r \)
- `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \)
- `dp[n, k]` is `90 + 90 * (10`

### For Loop Statement
```
for i in range(1, k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - The loop condition for the next iteration is `i < k`.

2. **Adjusting `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be updated to 3 for the next iteration.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `total` is not part of the loop head and remains unchanged.
   - `n` is not part of the loop head and remains unchanged.
   - `k` is not part of the loop head and remains unchanged.
   - `dp[n, k]` is not part of the loop head and remains unchanged.

### Conclusion
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

### Final Answer
State: **`total` is 9, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer within the range from \( l \) to \( r \), `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \), `dp[n, k]` is `90 + 90 * (10`**
