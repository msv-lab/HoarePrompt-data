Postcondition: **n is an integer representing a number within the range from \( l \) to \( r \), k is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \), and dp is a dictionary used for memoization where keys are tuples of (number, k) and values are integers. The value of k is not equal to 0. Additionally, \((n, k)\) is not in dp, and \( n \ge 10^k \)**
