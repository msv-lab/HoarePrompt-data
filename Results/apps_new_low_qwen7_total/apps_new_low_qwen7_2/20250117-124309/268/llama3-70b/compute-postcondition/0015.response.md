The initial state is:
- `total` is 9
- `i` is 3
- `n` is an integer within the range from \( l \) to \( r \)
- `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \)
- `dp[n, k]` is `90 + 90 * (10 ** 9)`

The code updates `dp[n, k]` by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` to its current value.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `i` is 3
- So, `9 * 10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `9 * 10 ** 2` which is `900`
- `10 ** (k - i)` becomes `10 ** (k - 3)`
- `10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `10 ** 2` which is `100`
- Therefore, `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `10 ** (k - 3) - 100`

So, the updated value of `dp[n, k]` is:
\[ dp[n, k] = 90 + 90 * (10 ** 9) + 900 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100) \]

Simplifying further:
\[ dp[n, k] = 90 + 90 * (10 ** 9) + 900 * 10 ** (k - 3) - 90000 \]
\[ dp[n, k] = 90 + 90 * (10 ** 9) - 90000 + 900 * 10 ** (k - 3) \]
\[ dp[n, k] = 90 - 90000 + 90 * (10 ** 9) + 900 * 10 ** (k - 3) \]
\[ dp[n, k] = -89910 + 90 * (10 ** 9) + 900 * 10 ** (k - 3) \]

Therefore, the updated value of `dp[n, k]` is `-89910 + 90 * (10 ** 9) + 900 * 10 ** (k - 3)`.

The output state is:
- `total` is 9
- `i` is 3
- `n` is an integer within the range from \( l \) to \( r \)
- `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \)
- `dp[n, k]` is `-89910 + 90 * (10 ** 9) + 900 * 10 ** (k - 3)`

Output State: **`total` is 9, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer within the range from \( l \) to \( r \), `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \), `dp[n, k]` is `-89910 + 90 * (10 ** 9) + 900 * 10 ** (k - 3)`**
