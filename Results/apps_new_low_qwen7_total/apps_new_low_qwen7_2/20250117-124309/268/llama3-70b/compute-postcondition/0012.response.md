Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, k):`
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

2. **Current States:**
   - `total` is 9
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an integer within the range from \( l \) to \( r \)
   - `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \)
   - `dp[n, k]` is 9 * 10

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `range(1, k)`, meaning the loop will iterate from `1` to `k-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts at `1` and increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` would be `2`.

5. **Check the Value of `k`:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `k`.
   - Given `i` is currently `1`, `k` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute again.
   - However, `k` was already set to a value between `1` and `10` at the start of the loop.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `2`.
   - The other states (`total`, `n`, `k`, and `dp[n, k]`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is 9, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range from \( l \) to \( r \), `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \), `dp[n, k]` is 90**
