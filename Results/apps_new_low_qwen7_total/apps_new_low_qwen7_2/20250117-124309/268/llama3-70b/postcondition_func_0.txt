The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). It returns the count of numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that are divisible by any power of `k`, modulo a given constant `MOD`. This count is computed using a dynamic programming approach stored in the dictionary `dp` for efficiency.
