#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). It returns the count of numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that are divisible by any power of `k`, modulo a given constant `MOD`. This count is computed using a dynamic programming approach stored in the dictionary `dp` for efficiency.

    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]`, which is either `n` if `n < 10^k`, or `9 * 10` if `(n, k)` is not in `dp`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. 

- `n` is an integer representing a number.
- `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \).
- `dp` is a dictionary used for memoization where keys are tuples of (number, k) and values are integers.

The function computes and returns either 0, the value associated with the key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp`, or the value stored in `dp[n, k]`. If `k` is 0, the function immediately returns 0. If `(n, k)` is already in `dp`, it returns the value associated with this key. Otherwise, it calculates the value based on whether `n` is less than \(10^k\). If `n < 10^k`, it sets `dp[n, k]` to `n`. Otherwise, it calculates `dp[n, k]` using a series of steps, ultimately setting it to `9 * 10` if `(n, k)` is not in `dp`. After computing the value, it takes the result modulo `MOD` before returning it.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `k` is 0, the function always returns 0.
- If `(n, k)` is already in `dp`, the function returns the cached value without further computation.
- If `n` is exactly \(10^k\), the function would set `dp[n, k]` to `9 * 10` since `n` is not strictly less than \(10^k\).

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `dp[n, k]` contains the computed value, which is either `n` if `n < 10^k`, or `9 * 10` if `(n, k)` is not in `dp` or `n >= 10^k`.
