Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

(l, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(l, r, k))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def func_1(l, r, k):
    dp = {}
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
    #The program returns (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD, where count(x, k, dp) represents the count of numbers less than or equal to x that are divisible by any power of k, and dp is a dictionary used for memoization.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). It returns the count of numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that are divisible by any power of `k`, modulo a given constant `MOD`. This count is computed using a dynamic programming approach stored in the dictionary `dp` for efficiency.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing a number (part of the range from \( l \) to \( r \)), k is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \), and dp is a dictionary used for memoization where keys are tuples of (number, k) and values are integers.
def count(n, k, dp):
    if (k == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer representing a number within the range from \( l \) to \( r \), k is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \), and dp is a dictionary used for memoization where keys are tuples of (number, k) and values are integers. The value of k is not equal to 0.
    if ((n, k) in dp) :
        return dp[n, k]
        #The program returns the integer value associated with key (n, k) in the dictionary dp
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer representing a number within the range from \( l \) to \( r \), k is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \), and dp is a dictionary used for memoization where keys are tuples of (number, k) and values are integers. The value of k is not equal to 0. Additionally, \((n, k)\) is not in dp.
    if (n < 10 ** k) :
        dp[n, k] = n
    else :
        dp[n, k] = 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: dp[n, k] = 9 * (10
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)

dp[n, k] %= MOD
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing a number within the range from \( l \) to \( r \), `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \), and `dp` is a dictionary used for memoization where keys are tuples of (number, k) and values are integers. The value of `k` is not equal to 0. Additionally, \((n, k)\) is either in `dp` with the value `n` if `n < 10^k`, or not in `dp` and the value of `dp[n, k]` is set to 9 * 10.
    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]`, which is either `n` if `n < 10^k`, or `9 * 10` if `(n, k)` is not in `dp`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. 

- `n` is an integer representing a number.
- `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \).
- `dp` is a dictionary used for memoization where keys are tuples of (number, k) and values are integers.

The function computes and returns either 0, the value associated with the key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp`, or the value stored in `dp[n, k]`. If `k` is 0, the function immediately returns 0. If `(n, k)` is already in `dp`, it returns the value associated with this key. Otherwise, it calculates the value based on whether `n` is less than \(10^k\). If `n < 10^k`, it sets `dp[n, k]` to `n`. Otherwise, it calculates `dp[n, k]` using a series of steps, ultimately setting it to `9 * 10` if `(n, k)` is not in `dp`. After computing the value, it takes the result modulo `MOD` before returning it.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `k` is 0, the function always returns 0.
- If `(n, k)` is already in `dp`, the function returns the cached value without further computation.
- If `n` is exactly \(10^k\), the function would set `dp[n, k]` to `9 * 10` since `n` is not strictly less than \(10^k\).

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `dp[n, k]` contains the computed value, which is either `n` if `n < 10^k`, or `9 * 10` if `(n, k)` is not in `dp` or `n >= 10^k`.
