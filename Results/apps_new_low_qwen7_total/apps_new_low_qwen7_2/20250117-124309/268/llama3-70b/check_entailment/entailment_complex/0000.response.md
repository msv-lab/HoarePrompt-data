Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function `func_1` correctly uses a dynamic programming approach with memoization (`dp`) to count the numbers within the range `[l, r]` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - It calculates the count for the entire range `[0, r]` and subtracts the count for the range `[0, l-1]`, effectively giving the count for the range `[l, r]`.
   - The result is taken modulo `998244353` as required.

2. **Function `count`**:
   - The function `count` correctly handles the base case when `k == 0`, returning 0.
   - It checks if the result for the current `(n, k)` pair is already in the `dp` dictionary and returns it if so.
   - If `n < 10^k`, it directly stores `n` in `dp[n, k]`.
   - If `n >= 10^k`, it calculates the number of valid numbers up to `n` by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and summing them up.
   - It ensures the result is taken modulo `998244353` before storing and returning it.

Given the problem constraints and the detailed explanation of both functions, the program should correctly compute the desired sum modulo `998244353` for any valid input.

Correctness: **True**
