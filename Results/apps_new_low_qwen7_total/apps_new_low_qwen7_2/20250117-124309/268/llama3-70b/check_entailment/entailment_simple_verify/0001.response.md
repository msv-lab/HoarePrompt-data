### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(l, r, k)` aims to compute the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - It correctly uses the helper function `count` to compute the cumulative count of numbers up to `r` and subtracts the count up to `l-1`. However, the interpretation of "sum" here is incorrect. `count` actually computes the count of numbers, not their sum.

2. **Function `count`**:
   - The function `count(n, k, dp)` is intended to compute the count of numbers up to `n` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - The logic in `count` is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly count the numbers meeting the criteria. Instead, it generates a sequence of numbers that do not necessarily meet the requirement of having at most `k` different digits.
   - The calculations involve iterating over leading digits and considering combinations, but they do not correctly handle the constraint of having at most `k` different digits in each number.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code attempts to use dynamic programming to avoid recalculating counts multiple times, which is a good approach for handling large ranges.
   - However, the modulo operation `% MOD` ensures that intermediate results do not overflow and the final result fits within the required constraints, which is correct.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - The provided examples do not correctly verify the correctness of the program. The examples suggest that the program should output the sum of numbers with at most `k` different digits, but the logic in `count` does not correctly achieve this.

Given the structure of the functions and their logic, the implementation is incorrect because `count` does not correctly count the numbers with at most `k` different digits. The program mistakenly interprets `count` as computing the sum instead of the count.

### Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
