Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the annotated code and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
1. **Function Definition**:
   ```python
   def func_1(l, r, k):
       dp = {}
       return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
   ```
   - The function `func_1` calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits by leveraging the `count` function.
   - It returns the result modulo `998244353`.

2. **Function `count`**:
   ```python
   def count(n, k, dp):
       if k == 0:
           return 0
       if (n, k) in dp:
           return dp[n, k]
       if n < 10 ** k:
           dp[n, k] = n
       else:
           dp[n, k] = 9
           for i in range(1, k):
               dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
           dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
           dp[n, k] %= MOD
       return dp[n, k]
   ```
   - The `count` function calculates the number of integers up to `n` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - If `k == 0`, it returns 0, as no numbers can contain 0 different digits.
   - It uses memoization to store previously computed results in the dictionary `dp`.
   - The main part of the logic involves:
     - Directly setting `dp[n, k] = n` if `n < 10 ** k`.
     - Calculating the count for larger `n` by breaking down the number into segments based on powers of 10 and using combinatorial counting.

### Correctness of the Logic:
- **Sum Calculation**: 
  - The `count` function computes the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits up to a given number `n`.
  - However, the `func_1` function uses these counts to find the difference between the count of numbers up to `r` and the count of numbers up to `l-1`. This difference gives the count of numbers in the range `[l, r]` that meet the criteria.
  - This approach indirectly gives the count of valid numbers in the range, but not their sum. 

- **Sum vs Count**:
  - The problem requires the sum of numbers, not just the count. The current implementation does not directly compute the sum but rather the count of valid numbers.
  - To get the sum, we need to iterate through the range `[l, r]` and check each number individually if it meets the criteria of having at most `k` different digits, and then sum those numbers.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not correctly calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits. It instead calculates the count of such numbers, which is fundamentally different from the required sum.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
