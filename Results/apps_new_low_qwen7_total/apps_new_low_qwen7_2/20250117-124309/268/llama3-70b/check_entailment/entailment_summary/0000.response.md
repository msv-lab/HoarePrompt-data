Reasoning:

The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `count`. Let's analyze the correctness of these functions:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` uses `count` to compute the number of integers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - The result is calculated as the difference between `count(r, k, dp)` and `count(l - 1, k, dp)`, which gives the count of numbers from `l` to `r` with at most `k` different digits.
   - This approach ensures that we only count numbers within the specified range.

2. **Understanding `count`**:
   - `count` is a recursive function with memoization (using `dp`).
   - It calculates the count of numbers up to `n` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - The base case when `k` is 0 returns 0, as a number with 0 different digits cannot exist.
   - For other cases, it handles the calculation in two parts:
     - If `n` is less than \(10^k\), it directly returns `n`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calculates the count considering the number of digits and the possible values for each digit position.
   - The function correctly handles edge cases and ensures that the result is taken modulo `998244353`.

Given the detailed analysis, both functions seem to be implemented correctly and align with the problem description. The `func_1` function correctly computes the required sum by leveraging the `count` function, and the `count` function accurately counts the numbers with at most `k` different digits.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
