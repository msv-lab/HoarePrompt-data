You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(l, r, k):

    dp = {}
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD

#Function 2:
def count(n, k, dp):
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    if (n, k) in dp:
        return dp[n, k]
    if n < 10 ** k:
        dp[n, k] = n
    else:
        dp[n, k] = 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
        dp[n, k] %= MOD
    return dp[n, k]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. 

- `n` is an integer representing a number.
- `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \le k \le 10 \).
- `dp` is a dictionary used for memoization where keys are tuples of (number, k) and values are integers.

The function computes and returns either 0, the value associated with the key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp`, or the value stored in `dp[n, k]`. If `k` is 0, the function immediately returns 0. If `(n, k)` is already in `dp`, it returns the value associated with this key. Otherwise, it calculates the value based on whether `n` is less than \(10^k\). If `n < 10^k`, it sets `dp[n, k]` to `n`. Otherwise, it calculates `dp[n, k]` using a series of steps, ultimately setting it to `9 * 10` if `(n, k)` is not in `dp`. After computing the value, it takes the result modulo `MOD` before returning it.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `k` is 0, the function always returns 0.
- If `(n, k)` is already in `dp`, the function returns the cached value without further computation.
- If `n` is exactly \(10^k\), the function would set `dp[n, k]` to `9 * 10` since `n` is not strictly less than \(10^k\).

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `dp[n, k]` contains the computed value, which is either `n` if `n < 10^k`, or `9 * 10` if `(n, k)` is not in `dp` or `n >= 10^k`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function aims to compute the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - It uses a helper function `count` to compute the cumulative count of numbers up to `r` and subtracts the count up to `l-1`.
   - The subtraction gives the sum of numbers between `l` and `r`.

2. **Function `count`**:
   - The function calculates the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits up to `n`.
   - If `k` is 0, it returns 0 because no numbers can have 0 different digits.
   - For other values of `k`, it initializes the count to 0 and iterates through possible leading digits (from 1 to 9), considering different cases for the remaining positions.
   - The calculations ensure that all numbers up to `n` are considered while adhering to the constraint of having at most `k` different digits.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles large numbers (`1 <= l, r < 10^18`) by leveraging dynamic programming to avoid recalculating counts multiple times.
   - The modulo operation `% MOD` ensures that intermediate results do not overflow and the final result fits within the required constraints.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the given examples, the program appears to correctly calculate the sum of numbers with at most `k` different digits within the specified range, modulo `998244353`.

Given the structure of the functions and their logic, the implementation seems to be correct and should work for the provided problem constraints.
