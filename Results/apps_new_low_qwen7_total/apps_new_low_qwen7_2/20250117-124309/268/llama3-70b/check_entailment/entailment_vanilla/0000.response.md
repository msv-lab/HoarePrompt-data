### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function aims to compute the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - It uses a helper function `count` to compute the cumulative count of numbers up to `r` and subtracts the count up to `l-1`.
   - The subtraction gives the sum of numbers between `l` and `r`.

2. **Function `count`**:
   - The function calculates the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits up to `n`.
   - If `k` is 0, it returns 0 because no numbers can have 0 different digits.
   - For other values of `k`, it initializes the count to 0 and iterates through possible leading digits (from 1 to 9), considering different cases for the remaining positions.
   - The calculations ensure that all numbers up to `n` are considered while adhering to the constraint of having at most `k` different digits.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles large numbers (`1 <= l, r < 10^18`) by leveraging dynamic programming to avoid recalculating counts multiple times.
   - The modulo operation `% MOD` ensures that intermediate results do not overflow and the final result fits within the required constraints.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the given examples, the program appears to correctly calculate the sum of numbers with at most `k` different digits within the specified range, modulo `998244353`.

Given the structure of the functions and their logic, the implementation seems to be correct and should work for the provided problem constraints.

### Correctness: **True**
