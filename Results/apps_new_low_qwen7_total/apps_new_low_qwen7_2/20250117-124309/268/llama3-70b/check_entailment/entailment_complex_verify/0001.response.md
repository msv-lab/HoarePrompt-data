### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to compute the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - It uses a helper function `count` to compute the cumulative count of numbers up to `r` and subtracts the count up to `l-1`.
   - The subtraction gives the sum of numbers between `l` and `r`.

2. **Function `count`**:
   - The function `count` calculates the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits up to `n`.
   - The core logic of `count` is flawed:
     - The function attempts to handle large numbers using a dynamic programming approach, but the logic for calculating the count is incorrect.
     - Specifically, the function incorrectly calculates the count by assuming that each digit position can independently vary, which is not true for numbers with at most `k` different digits.
     - The calculation of `dp[n, k]` in the `else` block is overly simplistic and does not account for the actual constraint of having at most `k` different digits.
     - The function does not properly handle the case when `n` has more than `k` different digits, which leads to incorrect results.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code attempts to use dynamic programming to avoid recalculating counts multiple times, but the base logic of the `count` function is fundamentally flawed.
   - The modulo operation `% MOD` ensures that intermediate results do not overflow, but it cannot fix the logical errors in the `count` function.
   - The example verification in the original assessment might have passed due to coincidental inputs, but it does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - The provided examples might appear to work correctly, but they do not cover all edge cases. For instance, consider `l = 100`, `r = 109`, and `k = 2`. The correct answer should exclude numbers like 101, 102, etc., but the current implementation might incorrectly include them.

### Conclusion:
The implementation of the `count` function is incorrect and does not properly handle the constraint of having at most `k` different digits. Therefore, the overall logic of the program is flawed, and it will produce incorrect results for many inputs.

### Final: **False**
