Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `l` is greater than `r`. According to the problem description, `l` should be less than or equal to `r`, but the program does not check this condition. As a result, if `l > r`, the program will still run and potentially produce incorrect results. For example, if the input is `50 10 2`, the program should not run because `l > r`, but it will, leading to undefined behavior. To fix this, the program should include a check at the beginning to ensure `l <= r`.
