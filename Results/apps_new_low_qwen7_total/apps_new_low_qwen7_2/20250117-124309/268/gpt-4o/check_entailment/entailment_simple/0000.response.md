Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the solution:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input values for `l`, `r`, and `k` and passes them to the `func_2` function.

2. **Helper Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a number `num` contains at most `k` different digits.
   - It converts the number to a string, creates a set of its characters, and checks if the size of the set is less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of all numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition checked by `func_1(num, k)`.
   - It iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, including both endpoints.
   - If `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`, it adds `num` to `total_sum` and takes the result modulo `998244353`.
   - After the loop, it returns the computed `total_sum`.

Given the annotations and the implementation, the program correctly follows the steps required to solve the problem. It checks each number in the range `[l, r]` to see if it meets the criteria (having at most `k` different digits), and sums up those that do, returning the result modulo `998244353`.

Therefore, the annotated program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
