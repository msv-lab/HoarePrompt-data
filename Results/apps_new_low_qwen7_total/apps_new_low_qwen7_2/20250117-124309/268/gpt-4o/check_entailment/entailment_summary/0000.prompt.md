 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
MOD = 998244353
(l, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_2(l, r, k))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer) and `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). It returns `True` if the length of the set of unique characters in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that the function checks whether the number `n` contains no more than `k` distinct digits. If `n` has fewer than `k` distinct digits or exactly `k` distinct digits, the function returns `True`. If `n` has more than `k` distinct digits, the function returns `False`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
    return total_sum
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2(l, r, k)` calculates the sum of all numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that contain at most `k` different digits, modulo \(998244353\). It iterates through each number in the range `[l, r]`, checks if the number satisfies the condition using `func_1(num, k)`, and if so, adds the number to `total_sum`. After the loop, it returns the computed `total_sum`. Potential edge cases include when `l > r`, in which case no numbers are processed, and when `k` is large enough that all numbers in the range `[l, r]` contain at most `k` different digits, leading to a potentially large sum. The function does not handle these edge cases explicitly but assumes valid input constraints \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\) and \(1 \le k \le 10\).
