Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers from \( l \) to \( r \) (inclusive) such that each number contains at most \( k \) different digits, and returning this sum modulo \( 998244353 \).
- Function `func_1(n, k)` correctly checks whether a number \( n \) contains at most \( k \) different digits.
- Function `func_2(l, r, k)` iterates through each number from \( l \) to \( r \), uses `func_1(num, k)` to check if the number meets the criteria, and accumulates the valid numbers' sum. This function correctly handles the summation within the specified constraints.
- Given the problem's constraints and the provided execution summaries, both functions collectively satisfy the requirements of the problem without any edge cases being mishandled.

Correctness: **True**
