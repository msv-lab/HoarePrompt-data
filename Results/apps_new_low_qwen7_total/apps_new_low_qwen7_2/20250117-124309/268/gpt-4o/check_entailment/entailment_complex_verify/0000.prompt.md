You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k

#Function 2:
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
    return total_sum



- Annotated Code: 
MOD = 998244353
(l, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_2(l, r, k))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns True if the length of the set of characters in the string representation of 'n' is less than or equal to 'k', otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer) and `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). It returns `True` if the length of the set of unique characters in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that the function checks whether the number `n` contains no more than `k` distinct digits. If `n` has fewer than `k` distinct digits or exactly `k` distinct digits, the function returns `True`. If `n` has more than `k` distinct digits, the function returns `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, and k are integers such that \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\) and \(1 \le k \le 10\). The function func_1(num, k) returns True if the number num contains at most k different digits, and MOD is defined as 998244353.
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total_sum` is the sum of all numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that satisfy `func_1(num, k)` modulo `MOD`, `num` is `r+1`, and `k` is the same as the initial value.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns total_sum which is the sum of all numbers between l and r (inclusive) that satisfy func_1(num, k) modulo MOD, with num being r+1 and k having its initial value
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2(l, r, k)` calculates the sum of all numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that contain at most `k` different digits, modulo \(998244353\). It iterates through each number in the range `[l, r]`, checks if the number satisfies the condition using `func_1(num, k)`, and if so, adds the number to `total_sum`. After the loop, it returns the computed `total_sum`. Potential edge cases include when `l > r`, in which case no numbers are processed, and when `k` is large enough that all numbers in the range `[l, r]` contain at most `k` different digits, leading to a potentially large sum. The function does not handle these edge cases explicitly but assumes valid input constraints \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\) and \(1 \le k \le 10\).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `l` is greater than `r`. According to the problem description, `l` should be less than or equal to `r`, but the program does not check this condition. As a result, if `l > r`, the program will still run and potentially produce incorrect results. For example, if the input is `50 10 2`, the program should not run because `l > r`, but it will, leading to undefined behavior. To fix this, the program should include a check at the beginning to ensure `l <= r`.
