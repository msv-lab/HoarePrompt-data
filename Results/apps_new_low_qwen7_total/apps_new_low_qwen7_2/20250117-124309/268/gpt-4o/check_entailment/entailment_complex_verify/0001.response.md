Reasoning:

1. The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers within a specified range \([l, r]\) that contain at most \(k\) different digits.
2. The solution provided consists of two functions:
   - `func_1(n, k)`: Checks if a number `n` has at most `k` unique digits.
   - `func_2(l, r, k)`: Iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r`, including both endpoints, and sums those that satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`. The sum is taken modulo \(998244353\).

### Analysis of the Functions:

- **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
  - The function `func_1(n, k)` correctly checks if the number `n` has at most `k` unique digits by converting `n` to a string, creating a set of its characters, and checking if the size of this set is less than or equal to `k`.
  - This logic is sound and works correctly for the given problem constraints.

- **Function `func_2(l, r, k)`**:
  - The function `func_2(l, r, k)` iterates through each number from `l` to `r` inclusive.
  - It calls `func_1(num, k)` to check if the current number `num` meets the criteria of having at most `k` unique digits.
  - If `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`, it adds `num` to `total_sum` and takes the result modulo `998244353` to ensure the sum stays within bounds.
  - The function handles the entire range correctly and accounts for the modulo operation to avoid overflow issues.

### Annotation Verification:

- **Before `func_2(l, r, k)` Call**:
  - `l`, `r`, and `k` are correctly read from the input and assigned.
  - The function `func_2(l, r, k)` is called with these values.

- **Within `func_2(l, r, k)`**:
  - The loop iterates from `l` to `r` (inclusive).
  - For each number `num` in this range, `func_1(num, k)` is called.
  - If `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`, `num` is added to `total_sum` and the sum is taken modulo `998244353`.
  - After the loop, `total_sum` is returned, which is the correct sum modulo `998244353`.

### Edge Case Consideration:
- The solution correctly handles the range \([l, r]\) and the constraint \(1 \le k \le 10\). The implementation does not need to explicitly handle edge cases such as \(l > r\) because the problem guarantees \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\).

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Both `func_1` and `func_2` operate as intended and handle the inputs appropriately.

Final: **True**
