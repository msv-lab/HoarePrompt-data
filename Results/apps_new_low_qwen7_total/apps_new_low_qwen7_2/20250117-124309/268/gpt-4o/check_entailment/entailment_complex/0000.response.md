Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers within a specified range `[l, r]` that contain at most `k` different digits, and returning this sum modulo `998244353`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1(n, k)` checks if a number `n` contains at most `k` different digits.
   - It uses the `set` data structure to count the unique digits in `n`.
   - The logic is correct as it ensures the number of unique digits in `n` does not exceed `k`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - `func_2(l, r, k)` iterates through each number in the range `[l, r]` and uses `func_1(num, k)` to check if the number should be included in the sum.
   - If a number meets the criteria, it is added to `total_sum`.
   - The modulo operation (`% MOD`) ensures the result fits within the required bounds.
   - The logic correctly handles the summation and modulo operations for the given range.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The functions assume valid input constraints: \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\) and \(1 \le k \le 10\).
   - There are no explicit checks for invalid inputs like `l > r`, which might be problematic without additional handling.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The main program calls `func_2(l, r, k)` with the correct parameters and prints the result.
   - The functions work together to solve the problem as described.

Based on the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the required functionality and adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
