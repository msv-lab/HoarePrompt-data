You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k

#Function 2:
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
    return total_sum



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2(l, r, k)` calculates the sum of all numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that contain at most `k` different digits, modulo \(998244353\). It iterates through each number in the range `[l, r]`, checks if the number satisfies the condition using `func_1(num, k)`, and if so, adds the number to `total_sum`. After the loop, it returns the computed `total_sum`. Potential edge cases include when `l > r`, in which case no numbers are processed, and when `k` is large enough that all numbers in the range `[l, r]` contain at most `k` different digits, leading to a potentially large sum. The function does not handle these edge cases explicitly but assumes valid input constraints \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\) and \(1 \le k \le 10\).+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `l` is greater than `r`. According to the problem description, `l` should be less than or equal to `r`, but the program does not check this condition. As a result, if `l > r`, the program will still run and potentially produce incorrect results. For example, if the input is `50 10 2`, the program should not run because `l > r`, but it will, leading to undefined behavior. To fix this, the program should include a check at the beginning to ensure `l <= r`.
