Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers within a specified range [l, r] that contain at most `k` different digits.
2. The solution provided consists of two functions:
   - `func_1(n, k)`: Checks if a number `n` has at most `k` unique digits.
   - `func_2(l, r, k)`: Iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r`, including both endpoints, and sums those that satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`. The sum is taken modulo `998244353`.

Given these observations:
- The function `func_1` correctly checks the number of unique digits in a number.
- The function `func_2` iterates over the range `[l, r]`, applies `func_1` to each number, and accumulates the valid numbers' sum. The use of modulo operation ensures the result stays within the required bounds.

Since the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, the program is expected to produce the correct output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
