### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the annotated code step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`:
This function checks if the number `n` has at most `k` different digits. It does so by converting the number `n` to a string, creating a set of its characters, and checking if the size of this set is less than or equal to `k`. This part is correct and works as intended.

#### Function `func_2(l, r, k)`:
This function iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r`, inclusive. For each number, it calls `func_1(num, k)` to check if the number meets the criteria of having at most `k` different digits. If it does, the number is added to `total_sum`, which is then returned modulo `998244353`.

#### Input Handling:
The main part of the code reads the input values `l`, `r`, and `k` from the standard input and calls `func_2(l, r, k)` with these values. The use of `map(int, input().split())` ensures that the input values are correctly converted to integers before passing them to the function.

#### Correctness of the Logic:
1. **`func_1(n, k)`**: This function correctly identifies numbers with at most `k` different digits.
2. **`func_2(l, r, k)`**: This function correctly iterates through the range `[l, r]`, applies the `func_1` function to each number, and sums up the numbers that satisfy the condition. The use of modulo `998244353` ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.
3. **Input Reading**: The code correctly reads the input and passes it to the function as expected.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. There are no logical errors or edge cases that would cause the program to fail.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it follows the requirements of the problem and correctly calculates the sum of numbers within the specified range that contain at most `k` different digits, taking the result modulo `998244353`.
