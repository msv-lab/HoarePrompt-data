You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k

#Function 2:
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
    return total_sum



- Annotated Code: 
MOD = 998244353
(l, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_2(l, r, k))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns True if the length of the set of characters in the string representation of 'n' is less than or equal to 'k', otherwise it returns False

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, and k are integers such that \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\) and \(1 \le k \le 10\). The function func_1(num, k) returns True if the number num contains at most k different digits, and MOD is defined as 998244353.
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total_sum` is the sum of all numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that satisfy `func_1(num, k)` modulo `MOD`, `num` is `r+1`, and `k` is the same as the initial value.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns total_sum which is the sum of all numbers between l and r (inclusive) that satisfy func_1(num, k) modulo MOD, with num being r+1 and k having its initial value




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers within a specified range [l, r] that contain at most `k` different digits.
2. The solution provided consists of two functions:
   - `func_1(n, k)`: Checks if a number `n` has at most `k` unique digits.
   - `func_2(l, r, k)`: Iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r`, including both endpoints, and sums those that satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`. The sum is taken modulo `998244353`.

Given these observations:
- The function `func_1` correctly checks the number of unique digits in a number.
- The function `func_2` iterates over the range `[l, r]`, applies `func_1` to each number, and accumulates the valid numbers' sum. The use of modulo operation ensures the result stays within the required bounds.

Since the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, the program is expected to produce the correct output for the given inputs.
