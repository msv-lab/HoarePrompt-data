#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns True if the length of the set of characters in the string representation of 'n' is less than or equal to 'k', otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer) and `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). It returns `True` if the length of the set of unique characters in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that the function checks whether the number `n` contains no more than `k` distinct digits. If `n` has fewer than `k` distinct digits or exactly `k` distinct digits, the function returns `True`. If `n` has more than `k` distinct digits, the function returns `False`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, and k are integers such that \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\) and \(1 \le k \le 10\). The function func_1(num, k) returns True if the number num contains at most k different digits, and MOD is defined as 998244353.
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total_sum` is the sum of all numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that satisfy `func_1(num, k)` modulo `MOD`, `num` is `r+1`, and `k` is the same as the initial value.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns total_sum which is the sum of all numbers between l and r (inclusive) that satisfy func_1(num, k) modulo MOD, with num being r+1 and k having its initial value
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2(l, r, k)` calculates the sum of all numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that contain at most `k` different digits, modulo \(998244353\). It iterates through each number in the range `[l, r]`, checks if the number satisfies the condition using `func_1(num, k)`, and if so, adds the number to `total_sum`. After the loop, it returns the computed `total_sum`. Potential edge cases include when `l > r`, in which case no numbers are processed, and when `k` is large enough that all numbers in the range `[l, r]` contain at most `k` different digits, leading to a potentially large sum. The function does not handle these edge cases explicitly but assumes valid input constraints \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\) and \(1 \le k \le 10\).
