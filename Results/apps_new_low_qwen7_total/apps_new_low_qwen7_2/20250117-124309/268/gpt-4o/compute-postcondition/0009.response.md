The code updates `total_sum` by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. Given the initial state where `num` is an integer less than `r` and equal to the previous `num` + 1, and `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, the value of `num` is specifically the previous `num` + 1.

Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` is `(total_sum + (previous num + 1)) % MOD`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer less than `r` and equal to the previous `num` + 1, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + (previous num + 1)) % MOD, and `k` is an integer.**
