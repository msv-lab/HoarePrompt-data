The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`. Both `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\). Additionally, the function accepts a third parameter `k`, which is an integer such that \(1 \le k \le 10\).

The function returns `total_sum`, which is the sum of all numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k) == True`, modulo \(998244353\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, and return the sum of all numbers between `l` and `r` inclusive that have at most `k` different digits, modulo \(998244353\).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and returns the sum of all numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that have at most `k` different digits, modulo \(998244353\).**
