The given code initializes the variable `total_sum` to 0. No operations are performed on `l`, `r`, `k`, or `total_sum`. The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and the function `func_1` remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\), `r` is an integer such that \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \le k \le 10\), `total_sum` is 0, and the function `func_1(num, k)` returns True if the number `num` contains at most `k` different digits.**
