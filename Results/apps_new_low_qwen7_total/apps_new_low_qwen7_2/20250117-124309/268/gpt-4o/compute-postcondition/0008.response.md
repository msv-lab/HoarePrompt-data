Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is defined as `for num in range(l, r + 1):`. The variables in the loop head are `num`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `num` must be within the range `l` to `r + 1`. Since the loop starts with the current value of `num` and increments it, the next value of `num` should be the current value of `num` plus 1.

3. **Update the state**: Given that `num` is an integer less than `r` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `num` will be `num + 1`.

4. **Adjust other variables**: The variables `k`, `total_sum`, and `func_1` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Construct the new state**: The new state will reflect the updated value of `num` and the unchanged values of `k`, `total_sum`, and `func_1`.

So, the new state is:

State: **`num` is an integer less than `r` and equal to the previous `num` + 1, `k` is an integer, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD, and `func_1` remains unchanged.**

In a more simplified form, the state can be written as:

State: **`num` is an integer less than `r` and equal to the previous `num` + 1, `k` is an integer, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD, and `func_1` remains unchanged.**
