The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `r`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num` in relation to `r`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was some integer value within the range `[l, r]`. For the loop to continue executing, `num` must be incremented by 1 and remain within the range `[l, r]`. 

Given that the loop iterates over `num` from `l` to `r`, if `num` is at its maximum value `r`, then incrementing `num` by 1 would result in `num` being greater than `r`, and the loop would terminate. Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, `num` must be less than `r`.

Since there is no change to `total_sum` if `func_1(num, k)` returns False, we do not need to adjust `total_sum` or `func_1` in this step.

State: **`num` is an integer less than `r`, `k` is an integer, `total_sum` is unchanged, and `func_1` is unchanged.**
