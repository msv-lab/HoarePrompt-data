`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Since `num` is an integer less than `r`, the value of `total_sum` changes to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is an integer less than `r`, `k` is an integer, `total_sum` is (total_sum + num) % MOD, and `func_1` is unchanged.**
