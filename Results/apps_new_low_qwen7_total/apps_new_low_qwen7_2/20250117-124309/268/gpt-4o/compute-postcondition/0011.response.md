Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that satisfy `func_1(num, k)` modulo `MOD`, `num` is `r+1`, and `k` is the same as the initial value.**

### Analysis Steps:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each number `num` from `l` to `r` inclusive.
   - For each `num`, it checks if `func_1(num, k)` returns True.
   - If `func_1(num, k)` returns True, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `total_sum`: Updated in the loop if `func_1(num, k)` returns True.
   - `num`: Iterates from `l` to `r` but is not updated within the loop itself.
   - `l` and `r` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - `k` remains constant throughout the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute exactly once for each `num` in the range `[l, r]` where `func_1(num, k)` returns True.
   - After the loop, `num` will be `r + 1` because the loop has checked all numbers up to `r`.
   - `total_sum` will contain the sum of all valid `num` values modulo `MOD`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationships and invariants identified are consistent with the described iterations and final output state. The loop checks each number in the range and updates `total_sum` accordingly, ensuring that `total_sum` reflects the sum of all valid numbers modulo `MOD`.

Thus, the final output state is determined by the sum of all numbers between `l` and `r` that satisfy `func_1(num, k)` modulo `MOD`, with `num` set to `r + 1` and `k` remaining unchanged.
