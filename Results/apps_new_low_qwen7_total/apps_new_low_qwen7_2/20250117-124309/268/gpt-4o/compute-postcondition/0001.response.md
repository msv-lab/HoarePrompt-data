Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `num`, `l`, and `r`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`.

3. **Initial Values Before the Loop Starts**:
   - `l` is an integer such that \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\).
   - `r` is an integer such that \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \le k \le 10\).
   - `total_sum` is 0 (though this does not affect the loop execution directly).

4. **Initial Value of `num`**: When the loop starts, `num` should be the smallest possible value in the range `[l, r]`. Since `l` is the lower bound, the first value of `num` in the loop will be `l`.

5. **Function `func_1(num, k)`**: This function checks if the number `num` contains at most `k` different digits. For the loop to enter the first iteration, `func_1(num, k)` must return `True` for `num = l`.

Therefore, the state of the objects at the start of the loop head must satisfy:
- `num` should be equal to `l`.
- `l` and `r` must satisfy \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\).
- `func_1(l, k)` must return `True`.

**State:**
**`total_sum` is 0, `l` is an integer such that \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\), `r` is an integer such that \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \le k \le 10\), and `func_1(l, k)` returns `True`**
