Postcondition: ***`num` is an integer less than `r` and equal to the previous `num` + 1, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD, and `k` is an integer. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to True, `total_sum` is further adjusted to (total_sum + (previous num + 1)) % MOD. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to False, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
