The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer) and `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). It returns `True` if the length of the set of unique characters in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that the function checks whether the number `n` contains no more than `k` distinct digits. If `n` has fewer than `k` distinct digits or exactly `k` distinct digits, the function returns `True`. If `n` has more than `k` distinct digits, the function returns `False`.
