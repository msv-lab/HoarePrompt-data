The function `func_1` accepts a single character string `c` representing a small English letter. It checks whether `c` is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). If `c` is a vowel, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles the case where `c` is not a single character or is not a lowercase letter, which would result in a return value of `False`. No other actions are performed by the function.
