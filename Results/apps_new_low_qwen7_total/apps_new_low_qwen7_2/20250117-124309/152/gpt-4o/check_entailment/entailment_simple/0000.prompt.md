Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.

Beroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.

For example:

  the following words have typos: "hellno", "hackcerrs" and "backtothefutttture";  the following words don't have typos: "helllllooooo", "tobeornottobe" and "oooooo". 

When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.

Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.


-----Output-----

Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.

If there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
hellno

Output
hell no 

Input
abacaba

Output
abacaba 

Input
asdfasdf

Output
asd fasd f

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    word = input().strip()
    print(func_3(word))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a single character string representing a small English letter.
def func_1(c):
    return c in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if 'c' is a vowel (i.e., one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), otherwise returns False

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: block is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, and its length is at least 3.
def func_2(block):
    if (len(block) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: block is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, and its length is at least 3
    first_consonant = block[0]
    for c in block:
        if c != first_consonant:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `block` is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, its length is at least 3, and the function returns `True` if any character in `block` is not equal to `first_consonant`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `block`.
    #   - The condition `if c != first_consonant:` checks if the current character is not equal to `first_consonant`.
    #   - If the condition is true, the function returns `True` immediately.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `block`: This string remains unchanged throughout the loop.
    #   - `first_consonant`: This variable remains the same as the initial value (it is the first character of `block`).
    #   - `c`: This variable changes with each iteration, taking the value of the current character being processed in `block`.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will continue to iterate as long as it finds characters in `block` that are equal to `first_consonant`.
    #   - If the loop finds any character that is not equal to `first_consonant`, it will return `True` immediately.
    #   - If the loop completes without finding any character that is not equal to `first_consonant`, the function will return `False`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The conditions described match the behavior of the loop. If any character in `block` is not equal to `first_consonant`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is that the function returns `True` if any character in `block` is not equal to `first_consonant`, and `False` otherwise.
    return False
    #The program returns False

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: word is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, with a length between 1 and 3000. func_1 and func_2 are functions that determine if a letter is a consonant and if a block of consonants has at least two different letters, respectively.
def func_3(word):
    n = len(word)

result = []

i = 0
    while i < n:
        start = i
        
        while i < n and not func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        
        if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]):
            result.append(word[start:start + 2])
            start += 2
            while start < i:
                result.append(word[start:start + 1])
                start += 1
        else:
            result.append(word[start:i])
        
        while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        
        result.append(word[start:i])
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next index in `word` where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and no further characters satisfy this condition (or `n` if no such index exists), `start` is the initial value of `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list, and `n` is the length of `word`.
    #
    #- **Variables that remain constant throughout the loop:**
    #  - `n` (the length of `word`).
    #
    #- **Final values of all variables after the loop finishes:**
    #  - `word`: The input string.
    #  - `i`: The next index in `word` where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and no further characters satisfy this condition (or `n` if no such index exists).
    #  - `start`: The initial value of `i` before any incrementation.
    #  - `result`: A list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list.
    #
    #- **Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute:**
    #  - The outer `while` loop continues as long as `i < n`. Once `i` reaches or exceeds `n`, the loop terminates. The inner `while` loops also run based on the conditions specified within them.
    return ' '.join(result)
    #The program returns a string that is the result of joining all substrings in the list `result` with a space, where each substring `word[start:i]` either meets the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or does not meet these conditions but are still included in the list. The final values of `word`, `i`, `start`, and `result` are as described in the initial state.
