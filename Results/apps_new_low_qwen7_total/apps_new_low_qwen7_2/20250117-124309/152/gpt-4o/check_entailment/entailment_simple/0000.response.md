### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(c)`**: 
   - This function correctly identifies whether a character `c` is a vowel. It returns `True` if `c` is in `{'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}` and `False` otherwise.
   
2. **Function `func_2(block)`**:
   - This function checks if a block of characters (consisting of at least 3 characters) contains more than one unique consonant. It returns `True` if the block has more than one distinct consonant and `False` otherwise.
   - The logic is correct, as it ensures that a block with more than one distinct consonant (and at least 3 consonants in total) is identified as having a typo.

3. **Function `func_3(word)`**:
   - This function processes the entire word and splits it into segments that do not contain consecutive consonants of length 3 or more (with the exception of blocks with identical characters).
   - The logic is correct:
     - It iterates through the word, identifying blocks of consonants.
     - When a block of consonants is found to be a typo (i.e., more than one distinct consonant), it splits the block appropriately.
     - It handles the case where a segment of consonants is not a typo (i.e., identical characters) by simply keeping it as is.
     - Finally, it joins all the segments with spaces to form the output string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided examples cover various edge cases, including words with no typos, words with typos, and words with consecutive identical consonants.
   - The implementation handles these cases correctly, ensuring that no extra spaces are inserted where they shouldn't be.

5. **Consistency and Completeness**:
   - The code consistently follows the problem statement and handles all necessary conditions without errors or omissions.
