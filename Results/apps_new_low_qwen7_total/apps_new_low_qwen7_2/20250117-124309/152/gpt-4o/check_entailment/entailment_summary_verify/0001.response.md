### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires identifying words with typos based on the presence of three or more consecutive consonants where at least two different letters are present.
   - If a typo is found, the word should be split into segments to ensure no segment contains a typo.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1(c)`**: This function correctly checks if a character is a vowel.
   - **Function `func_2(block)`**: This function correctly checks if a block of consonants has at least three consecutive characters and at least two different characters.
   - **Function `func_3(word)`**: This function processes the word and inserts spaces to handle typos.

3. **Detailed Walkthrough of `func_3`**:
   - **Initialization and Loop**: The function iterates through the word, keeping track of the current segment (`start` and `i`).
   - **Consecutive Consonants Check**: When a block of consonants is detected (`i - start >= 3`), it checks if it forms a typo using `func_2`.
   - **Handling Typos**: If a typo is found, it splits the consonant block into segments and inserts spaces accordingly.
   - **Non-Typo Segments**: If no typo is detected, it appends the segment directly.
   - **Handling Vowels**: The loop continues until the end of the word, ensuring that all segments are processed.

4. **Testing the Implementation**:
   - The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the implementation:
     - `"hellno"` → `"hell no"`
     - `"abacaba"` → `"abacaba"`
     - `"asdfasdf"` → `"asd fasd f"`

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Long Sequences of the Same Consonant**: The code correctly handles this case by breaking the sequence into smaller segments. For example, `"helllllooooo"` should remain unchanged because it only contains repeated consonants.
   - **Multiple Consecutive Blocks of Consonants**: The code should split these blocks appropriately. For example, `"hackcerrs"` should be split as `"hack cer rs"`.

6. **Validation Using Function Summaries**:
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_3`. It processes the word and creates segments based on the criteria for a typo, inserting spaces as needed.

Given the detailed analysis and the correct handling of various cases, the provided code appears to correctly implement the required functionality.
