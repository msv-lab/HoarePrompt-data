You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.

Beroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.

For example:

  the following words have typos: "hellno", "hackcerrs" and "backtothefutttture";  the following words don't have typos: "helllllooooo", "tobeornottobe" and "oooooo". 

When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.

Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.


-----Output-----

Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.

If there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
hellno

Output
hell no 

Input
abacaba

Output
abacaba 

Input
asdfasdf

Output
asd fasd f

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(c):
    return c in 'aeiou'

#Function 2:
def func_2(block):
    if len(block) < 3:
        return False
    first_consonant = block[0]
    for c in block:
        if c != first_consonant:
            return True
    return False

#Function 3:
def func_3(word):
    n = len(word)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        start = i
        while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
            i += 1
        if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]):
            result.append(word[start:start + 2])
            start += 2
            while start < i:
                result.append(word[start:start + 1])
                start += 1
        else:
            result.append(word[start:i])
        while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        result.append(word[start:i])
    return ' '.join(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` takes a non-empty string `word` as input and processes it to create a list of substrings based on specific conditions. It then joins these substrings with spaces and returns the resulting string. The function iterates through the input string `word` and identifies segments of consecutive non-consonant characters. For each segment, if it meets the criteria (having a length of at least 3 and containing at least two different letters, as determined by `func_2`), it extracts the first two characters and appends the remaining characters one by one. If the segment does not meet the criteria, it simply appends the entire segment. The function also handles the case where the segment consists of only one character, which is always appended. The final state of the program includes the input string `word`, the index `i` pointing to the next consonant in `word`, the initial value of `i` stored in `start`, and the list `result` containing the processed substrings.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the block of consonants has all letters the same but still needs to be split to avoid a typo. For example, consider the input "zzz":

- The function `func_3` would not insert any spaces into "zzz" because the block "zzz" is detected as having three or more consonants in a row, and since there are no different letters, it should not be considered a typo. However, according to the problem description, "zzz" should be split into "zz z" to avoid being considered a typo.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:
- Input: "zzz"
- Expected Output: "zz z"
- Actual Output: "zzz"

Since the program does not handle this edge case correctly, the overall correctness is **False**.
