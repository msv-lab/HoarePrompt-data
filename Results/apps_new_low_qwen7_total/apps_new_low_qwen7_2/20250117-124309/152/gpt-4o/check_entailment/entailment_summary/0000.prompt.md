 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.

Beroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.

For example:

  the following words have typos: "hellno", "hackcerrs" and "backtothefutttture";  the following words don't have typos: "helllllooooo", "tobeornottobe" and "oooooo". 

When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.

Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.


-----Output-----

Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.

If there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
hellno

Output
hell no 

Input
abacaba

Output
abacaba 

Input
asdfasdf

Output
asd fasd f

# Functions with Execution Summary:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    word = input().strip()
    print(func_3(word))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(c):
    return c in 'aeiou'
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a single character string `c` representing a small English letter. It checks whether `c` is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). If `c` is a vowel, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles the case where `c` is not a single character or is not a lowercase letter, which would result in a return value of `False`. No other actions are performed by the function.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(block):
    if len(block) < 3:
        return False
    first_consonant = block[0]
    for c in block:
        if c != first_consonant:
            return True
    return False
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `block`, which is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length of at least 3. It returns `True` if any character in `block` is not equal to the first character of `block`, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input string `block`. There are no cases where the function returns `False` due to the length of `block` being less than 3, as the function first checks if the length of `block` is at least 3 and returns `False` immediately if it is not.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(word):
    n = len(word)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        start = i
        while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
            i += 1
        if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]):
            result.append(word[start:start + 2])
            start += 2
            while start < i:
                result.append(word[start:start + 1])
                start += 1
        else:
            result.append(word[start:i])
        while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        result.append(word[start:i])
    return ' '.join(result)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` takes a non-empty string `word` as input and processes it to create a list of substrings based on specific conditions. It then joins these substrings with spaces and returns the resulting string. The function iterates through the input string `word` and identifies segments of consecutive non-consonant characters. For each segment, if it meets the criteria (having a length of at least 3 and containing at least two different letters, as determined by `func_2`), it extracts the first two characters and appends the remaining characters one by one. If the segment does not meet the criteria, it simply appends the entire segment. The function also handles the case where the segment consists of only one character, which is always appended. The final state of the program includes the input string `word`, the index `i` pointing to the next consonant in `word`, the initial value of `i` stored in `start`, and the list `result` containing the processed substrings.
