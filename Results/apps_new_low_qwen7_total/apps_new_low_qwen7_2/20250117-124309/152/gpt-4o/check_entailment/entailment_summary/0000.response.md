Reasoning:
- The problem requires identifying and fixing typos in a word according to specific rules. A typo is defined as having three or more consecutive consonants unless they are all the same.
- `func_1` correctly identifies vowels.
- `func_2` incorrectly handles the check for a typo. According to the problem statement, `func_2` should return `True` if there are at least three consonants in a row and at least two different letters among them. However, the current implementation of `func_2` will return `True` for blocks like "cccc" because all characters are the same, which violates the problem's definition of a typo.
- `func_3` iterates over the word, identifying segments of consonants and vowels. It splits the word wherever it finds a segment of consonants that qualifies as a typo according to the rules. However, the logic within `func_3` assumes that `func_2` correctly identifies typos, which it does not based on the current implementation.

Given the issues in `func_2`, the overall program cannot correctly identify and split words according to the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
