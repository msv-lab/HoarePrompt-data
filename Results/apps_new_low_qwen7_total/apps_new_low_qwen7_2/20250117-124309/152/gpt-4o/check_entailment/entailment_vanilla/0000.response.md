### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to identify words with typos based on the criteria: three or more consecutive consonants where at least two different letters are present.
   - If a typo is found, we need to insert spaces to break the word into parts where no part has a typo.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1(c)`**: This function checks if a character is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). This is correctly implemented.
   - **Function `func_2(block)`**: This function checks if a block of characters (consonants) has at least three consecutive characters and at least two different characters. It is also correctly implemented.
   - **Function `func_3(word)`**: This function processes the entire word and handles the insertion of spaces based on the criteria for a typo.

3. **Detailed Walkthrough of `func_3`**:
   - **Initialization and Loop**: The function iterates through the word, keeping track of the current segment (`start` and `i`).
   - **Consecutive Consonants Check**: When a block of consonants is detected (`i - start >= 3`), it checks if it forms a typo using `func_2`.
   - **Handling Typos**: If a typo is found, it splits the consonant block into segments and inserts spaces accordingly.
   - **Non-Typo Segments**: If no typo is detected, it appends the segment directly.
   - **Handling Vowels**: The loop continues until the end of the word, ensuring that all segments are processed.

4. **Testing the Implementation**:
   - The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the implementation:
     - `"hellno"` → `"hell no"`
     - `"abacaba"` → `"abacaba"`
     - `"asdfasdf"` → `"asd fasd f"`

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Words with only vowels should remain unchanged.
   - Long sequences of the same consonant should be handled correctly.
   - Words with multiple consecutive blocks of consonants should be split appropriately.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

### Correctness: **True**
