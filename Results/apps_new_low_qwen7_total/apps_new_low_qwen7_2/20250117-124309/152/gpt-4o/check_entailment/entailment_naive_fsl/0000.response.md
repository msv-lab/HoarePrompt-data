Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the block of consonants has all letters the same but still needs to be split to avoid a typo. For example, consider the input "zzz":

- The function `func_3` would not insert any spaces into "zzz" because the block "zzz" is detected as having three or more consonants in a row, and since there are no different letters, it should not be considered a typo. However, according to the problem description, "zzz" should be split into "zz z" to avoid being considered a typo.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:
- Input: "zzz"
- Expected Output: "zz z"
- Actual Output: "zzz"

Since the program does not handle this edge case correctly, the overall correctness is **False**.
