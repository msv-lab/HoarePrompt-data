Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly identifies vowels and returns `False` for consonants. It is used to check if a character is a vowel.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function checks if a block of at least 3 consonants contains at least two different consonants. It correctly returns `True` if there are at least two different consonants and `False` otherwise. However, there's a logical error in the function: it should return `True` if the block of consonants is valid and `False` otherwise. The current implementation always returns `False`, which is incorrect.
3. **Function `func_3`**: This function processes the input word and correctly identifies segments of consonants. It handles the logic of adding spaces where necessary to avoid typos. However, the current implementation of `func_2` will incorrectly identify many valid blocks as invalid, leading to incorrect splitting of the word.

Given the logical error in `func_2`, the overall functionality of the program will be incorrect because it will incorrectly identify many valid words as having typos and will therefore split them incorrectly.

Correctness: **False**
