### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to identify words with typos based on the criteria: three or more consecutive consonants where at least two different letters are present.
   - If a typo is found, we need to insert spaces to break the word into parts where no part has a typo.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1(c)`**: This function checks if a character is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). This is correctly implemented.
   - **Function `func_2(block)`**: This function checks if a block of characters (consonants) has at least three consecutive characters and at least two different characters. However, there is a flaw in the implementation. The function always returns `False` because the loop never executes when `len(block) >= 3`. This is because the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `len(block) - 1`, and the condition `c != first_consonant` can never be true since `first_consonant` is set to `block[0]`.

3. **Detailed Walkthrough of `func_3`**:
   - **Initialization and Loop**: The function iterates through the word, keeping track of the current segment (`start` and `i`).
   - **Consecutive Consonants Check**: When a block of consonants is detected (`i - start >= 3`), it checks if it forms a typo using `func_2`. However, `func_2` will always return `False` due to the flaw mentioned above.
   - **Handling Typos**: Since `func_2` always returns `False`, the code will never insert spaces for a typo. This means that words with valid typos will not be corrected.

4. **Testing the Implementation**:
   - The examples provided in the problem statement are not correctly handled by the implementation:
     - `"hellno"` → `"hell no"` (This is correct according to the problem statement, but the function will not actually handle this case because `func_2` returns `False`.)
     - `"abacaba"` → `"abacaba"` (This is correct, and `func_2` will not be called since there are no three consecutive consonants.)
     - `"asdfasdf"` → `"asd fasd f"` (This is incorrect according to the problem statement, as the function will not insert spaces because `func_2` returns `False`.)

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Words with only vowels should remain unchanged.
   - Long sequences of the same consonant should be handled correctly.
   - Words with multiple consecutive blocks of consonants should be split appropriately.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality because `func_2` always returns `False`, leading to incorrect handling of words with valid typos.

### Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
