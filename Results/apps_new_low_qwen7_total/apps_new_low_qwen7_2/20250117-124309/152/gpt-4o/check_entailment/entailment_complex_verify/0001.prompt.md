You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.

Beroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.

For example:

  the following words have typos: "hellno", "hackcerrs" and "backtothefutttture";  the following words don't have typos: "helllllooooo", "tobeornottobe" and "oooooo". 

When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.

Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.


-----Output-----

Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.

If there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
hellno

Output
hell no 

Input
abacaba

Output
abacaba 

Input
asdfasdf

Output
asd fasd f

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a single character string representing a small English letter.
def func_1(c):
    return c in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if 'c' is a vowel (i.e., one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single character string `c` representing a small English letter. It checks whether `c` is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). If `c` is a vowel, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles the case where `c` is not a single character or is not a lowercase letter, which would result in a return value of `False`. No other actions are performed by the function.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: block is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, and its length is at least 3.
def func_2(block):
    if (len(block) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: block is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, and its length is at least 3
    first_consonant = block[0]
    for c in block:
        if c != first_consonant:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `block` is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, its length is at least 3, and the function returns `True` if any character in `block` is not equal to `first_consonant`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `block`.
    #   - The condition `if c != first_consonant:` checks if the current character is not equal to `first_consonant`.
    #   - If the condition is true, the function returns `True` immediately.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `block`: This string remains unchanged throughout the loop.
    #   - `first_consonant`: This variable remains the same as the initial value (it is the first character of `block`).
    #   - `c`: This variable changes with each iteration, taking the value of the current character being processed in `block`.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will continue to iterate as long as it finds characters in `block` that are equal to `first_consonant`.
    #   - If the loop finds any character that is not equal to `first_consonant`, it will return `True` immediately.
    #   - If the loop completes without finding any character that is not equal to `first_consonant`, the function will return `False`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The conditions described match the behavior of the loop. If any character in `block` is not equal to `first_consonant`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is that the function returns `True` if any character in `block` is not equal to `first_consonant`, and `False` otherwise.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `block`, which is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length of at least 3. It returns `True` if any character in `block` is not equal to the first character of `block`, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input string `block`. There are no cases where the function returns `False` due to the length of `block` being less than 3, as the function first checks if the length of `block` is at least 3 and returns `False` immediately if it is not.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: word is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, with a length between 1 and 3000. func_1 and func_2 are functions that determine if a letter is a consonant and if a block of consonants has at least two different letters, respectively.
def func_3(word):
    n = len(word)

result = []

i = 0
    while i < n:
        start = i
        
        while i < n and not func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        
        if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]):
            result.append(word[start:start + 2])
            start += 2
            while start < i:
                result.append(word[start:start + 1])
                start += 1
        else:
            result.append(word[start:i])
        
        while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        
        result.append(word[start:i])
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next index in `word` where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and no further characters satisfy this condition (or `n` if no such index exists), `start` is the initial value of `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list, and `n` is the length of `word`.
    #
    #- **Variables that remain constant throughout the loop:**
    #  - `n` (the length of `word`).
    #
    #- **Final values of all variables after the loop finishes:**
    #  - `word`: The input string.
    #  - `i`: The next index in `word` where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and no further characters satisfy this condition (or `n` if no such index exists).
    #  - `start`: The initial value of `i` before any incrementation.
    #  - `result`: A list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list.
    #
    #- **Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute:**
    #  - The outer `while` loop continues as long as `i < n`. Once `i` reaches or exceeds `n`, the loop terminates. The inner `while` loops also run based on the conditions specified within them.
    return ' '.join(result)
    #The program returns a string that is the result of joining all substrings in the list `result` with a space, where each substring `word[start:i]` either meets the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or does not meet these conditions but are still included in the list. The final values of `word`, `i`, `start`, and `result` are as described in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes a non-empty string `word` as input and processes it to create a list of substrings based on specific conditions. It then joins these substrings with spaces and returns the resulting string. The function iterates through the input string `word` and identifies segments of consecutive non-consonant characters. For each segment, if it meets the criteria (having a length of at least 3 and containing at least two different letters, as determined by `func_2`), it extracts the first two characters and appends the remaining characters one by one. If the segment does not meet the criteria, it simply appends the entire segment. The function also handles the case where the segment consists of only one character, which is always appended. The final state of the program includes the input string `word`, the index `i` pointing to the next consonant in `word`, the initial value of `i` stored in `start`, and the list `result` containing the processed substrings.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to identify words with typos based on the criteria: three or more consecutive consonants where at least two different letters are present.
   - If a typo is found, we need to insert spaces to break the word into parts where no part has a typo.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1(c)`**: This function checks if a character is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). This is correctly implemented.
   - **Function `func_2(block)`**: This function checks if a block of characters (consonants) has at least three consecutive characters and at least two different characters. It is also correctly implemented.
   - **Function `func_3(word)`**: This function processes the entire word and handles the insertion of spaces based on the criteria for a typo.

3. **Detailed Walkthrough of `func_3`**:
   - **Initialization and Loop**: The function iterates through the word, keeping track of the current segment (`start` and `i`).
   - **Consecutive Consonants Check**: When a block of consonants is detected (`i - start >= 3`), it checks if it forms a typo using `func_2`.
   - **Handling Typos**: If a typo is found, it splits the consonant block into segments and inserts spaces accordingly.
   - **Non-Typo Segments**: If no typo is detected, it appends the segment directly.
   - **Handling Vowels**: The loop continues until the end of the word, ensuring that all segments are processed.

4. **Testing the Implementation**:
   - The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the implementation:
     - `"hellno"` → `"hell no"`
     - `"abacaba"` → `"abacaba"`
     - `"asdfasdf"` → `"asd fasd f"`

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Words with only vowels should remain unchanged.
   - Long sequences of the same consonant should be handled correctly.
   - Words with multiple consecutive blocks of consonants should be split appropriately.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the required functionality.
