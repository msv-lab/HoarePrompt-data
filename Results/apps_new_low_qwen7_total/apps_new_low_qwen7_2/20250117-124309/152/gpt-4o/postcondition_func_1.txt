The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `block`, which is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length of at least 3. It returns `True` if any character in `block` is not equal to the first character of `block`, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input string `block`. There are no cases where the function returns `False` due to the length of `block` being less than 3, as the function first checks if the length of `block` is at least 3 and returns `False` immediately if it is not.
