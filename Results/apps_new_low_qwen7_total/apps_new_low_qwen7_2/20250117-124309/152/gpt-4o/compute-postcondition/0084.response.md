To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
```

This loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i < n`
2. `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `word` is a non-empty string
- `i` is `start + 3`
- `start` is the initial value of `i`
- `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list
- `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop header must be satisfied:
1. `i < n` should be true
2. `func_1(word[i])` should return `True`

From the given information:
- `i` is currently `start + 3`
- `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`

Since `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`, this condition is already satisfied. Therefore, the only remaining condition is that `i < n` must be true.

To satisfy `i < n`:
- `n` must be greater than `start + 3` (which is the current value of `i`)

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `start + 3`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list, and `n` must be greater than `start + 3`**
