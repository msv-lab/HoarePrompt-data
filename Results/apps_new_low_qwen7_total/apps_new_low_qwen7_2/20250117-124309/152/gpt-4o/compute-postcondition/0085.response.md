The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was `start + 3`, so now `i` is `start + 4`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `start + 4`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list, and `n` must be greater than `start + 3`.**
