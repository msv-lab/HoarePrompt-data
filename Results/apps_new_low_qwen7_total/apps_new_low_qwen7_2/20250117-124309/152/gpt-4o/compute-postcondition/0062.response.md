`i` is incremented by 1, which means the new value of `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1. The value of `word` and the condition `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is less than `n` and equals original_i + 1, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`**
