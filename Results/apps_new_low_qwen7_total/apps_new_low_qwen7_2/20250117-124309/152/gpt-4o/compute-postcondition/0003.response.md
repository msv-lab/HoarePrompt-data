Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.

2. **Variables in the Loop Condition**: The loop condition involves three variables: `i`, `n`, and `word[i]`.

3. **Analyze Each Variable**:
   - **`i`**: The variable `i` is compared to `n` and the result of `func_1(word[i])`.
   - **`n`**: The variable `n` sets the upper limit for `i`.
   - **`word[i]`**: The element at index `i` of the string `word` is passed to `func_1`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Executes at Least Once**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.

5. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `start` is `i` (though `start` isn't used in the loop condition).

6. **Ensuring the First Iteration**:
   - To ensure `i < n`, `i` must be set to 0 (the smallest valid index for a non-empty string).
   - To ensure `(not func_1(word[i]))`, `func_1(word[0])` must return `False`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to set `i` to 0 and ensure that `func_1(word[0])` returns `False`.

**Final State**:
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` must be 0.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `func_1(word[0])` must return `False`.

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, and `func_1(word[0])` must return `False`**
