The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. The other variables (`word` and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, and `func_1(word[0])` must return `False`.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, and `func_1(word[0])` must return `False`**
