Postcondition: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, `result` is a list of all substrings `word[start:i]` (where `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`) concatenated with any additional substrings `word[start:i]` that did not meet the length condition but were still included, and the condition `(i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]))` is satisfied**
