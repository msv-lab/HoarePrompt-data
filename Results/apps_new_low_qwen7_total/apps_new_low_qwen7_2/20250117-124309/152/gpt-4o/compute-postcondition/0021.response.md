Postcondition: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, `start` is equal to `i`, and `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.**
