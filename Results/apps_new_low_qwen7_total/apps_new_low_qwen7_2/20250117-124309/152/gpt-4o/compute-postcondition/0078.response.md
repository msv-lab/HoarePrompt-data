The code snippet appends the substring `word[start:i]` to the list `result`. This means that the list `result` now includes this particular substring. However, the value of `i` itself is not updated by this line of code; it remains the same as it was before. Similarly, `start`, `word`, `func_1`, and `func_2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the index of the first character in `word` for which `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` (where `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `False`) concatenated with any additional substrings `word[start:i]` that did not meet both the length condition and the function condition but were still included, and `result` has been appended with the substring `word[start:i]`.**
