Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.

2. **Analyze Each Variable in the Loop Condition**:
   - `i`: This is the current index being checked in the loop.
   - `n`: This is a constant or a variable that defines the upper limit for `i`.
   - `func_1(word[i])`: This function returns `True` or `False` based on the character at index `i` in the string `word`.

3. **Determine the Required State**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))` must be true.
   - Since `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`, we know that `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` for the loop to execute the first time.
   - Additionally, `i < n` must be true.

4. **Initial Values**:
   - We know that `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`.
   - `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - To ensure `i < n`, this condition is already met because `n` is defined as being greater than `i + 1`.
   - To ensure `(not func_1(word[i]))`, we need to make sure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the first iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`, `start` is equal to `i`, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False**.
