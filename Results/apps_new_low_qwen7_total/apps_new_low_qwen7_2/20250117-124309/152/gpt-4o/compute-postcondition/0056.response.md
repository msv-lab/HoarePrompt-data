The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. This affects the value of `i`, but the initial values of `word`, `start`, `result`, and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `func_2` is referenced but not defined, so its behavior cannot be determined, but we know that the condition `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True` would affect the `result`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `word` is a non-empty string
- `i` is incremented to `i + 1`
- `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation
- `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if \( i - start \ge 3 \) and \( func_2(word[start:i]) \) returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`

After executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` is `start + 1`. Since the condition `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True` is not specified, we consider both cases:

1. If `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `False`, `result` remains unchanged, and includes the substring `word[start:i]`.
2. If `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, `result` includes all characters from `start` to `i-1`.

Since the exact value of `func_2` is not given, we can only state the updated value of `i` and keep the `result` in its general form.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `start + 1`, `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if \( i - start \ge 3 \) and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.**
