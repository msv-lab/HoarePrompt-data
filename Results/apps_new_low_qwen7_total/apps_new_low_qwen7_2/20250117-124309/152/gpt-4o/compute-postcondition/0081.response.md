`i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1. The values of `word`, `start`, `result`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `start + 1`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list, and `i` must be less than `n`.**
