Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `func_1(word[0])` must return `False`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - Since `i` is 1, we need to check `word[1]` (the second character of `word`).

5. **Ensuring Loop Executes Again:**
   - To ensure the loop executes again, `i` must be incremented.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 2.
   - Additionally, the condition `func_1(word[i])` must still hold true when `i` is 2.

6. **Ensuring `func_1(word[i])` Returns `False`:**
   - We need to ensure that `func_1(word[2])` returns `False`.

### Conclusion:

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, the following adjustments are necessary:
- Increment `i` from 1 to 2.
- Ensure `func_1(word[2])` returns `False`.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

**State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1, and `func_1(word[2])` must return `False`**
