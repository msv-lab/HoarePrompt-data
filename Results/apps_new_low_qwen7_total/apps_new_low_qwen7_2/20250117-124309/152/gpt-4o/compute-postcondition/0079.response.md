Postcondition: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, and `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list.**
