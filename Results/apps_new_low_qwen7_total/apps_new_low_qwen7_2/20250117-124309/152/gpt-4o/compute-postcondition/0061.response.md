Let's break down the conditions for the loop to execute at least once.

### Initial Conditions
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `start` is equal to the previous value of `i`.
- `result` is a list containing the substring `word[start:i]` if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` contains the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition `i < n`:**
   - For the loop to proceed, `i` must be less than `n`. This condition is already satisfied as given initially (`i < n`).

2. **Condition `(not func_1(word[i]))`:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
   - To make the loop proceed, we need to ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Required Adjustments
- We need to adjust the state such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` when the loop starts.

Given that `word` is a non-empty string and `i` is less than `n`, the only condition that controls the loop execution is `func_1(word[i])`.

### Final State Before the Loop
- Ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` when the loop starts.

Thus, the final state before the loop should be:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is less than `n`, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`**.
