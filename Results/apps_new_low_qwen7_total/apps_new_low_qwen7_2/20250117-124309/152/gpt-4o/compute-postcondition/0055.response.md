To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given program state.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
```

This means the loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i < n`
2. `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`

### Given Program State
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the largest index \( j \) such that \( func_1(word[j]) \) returns `True` and \( j < n \) plus 1, and then `i` is incremented by 1.
- `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation.
- `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if \( i - start \ge 3 \) and \( func_2(word[start:i]) \) returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

### Analysis
For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be satisfied:
1. `i < n`
2. `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`

Given the current state:
- `i` has already been incremented by 1, so the next index to check is `i + 1`.
- We need to ensure that `i + 1` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i + 1])` returns `True`.

### Adjustments Needed
- The state of `i` needs to be updated to `i + 1`.
- The state of `n` must be such that `i + 1` is still less than `n`.

### Final State
The variables `i` and `n` are the ones that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if \( i - start \ge 3 \) and \( func_2(word[start:i]) \) returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`**.

However, since we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` should be greater than `i + 1` (which is the current `i` incremented by 1).

Final State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if \( i - start \ge 3 \) and \( func_2(word[start:i]) \) returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`**.
