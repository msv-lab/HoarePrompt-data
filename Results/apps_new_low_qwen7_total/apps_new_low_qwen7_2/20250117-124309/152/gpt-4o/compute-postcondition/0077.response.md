Postcondition: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the index of the first character in `word` for which `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, and `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` (where `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `False`) concatenated with any additional substrings `word[start:i]` that did not meet both the length condition and the function condition but were still included.**
