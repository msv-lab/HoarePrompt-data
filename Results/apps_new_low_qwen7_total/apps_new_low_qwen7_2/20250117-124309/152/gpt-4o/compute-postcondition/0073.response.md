The initial state is: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, `start` is `0`, `result` is `['']`.

Let's analyze the code block:

```python
result.append(word[start:start + 1])
start += 1
```

- The first line `result.append(word[start:start + 1])` appends a substring of `word` starting at index `start` and ending just before `start + 1` (which is essentially just the character at index `start`) to the list `result`.
- The second line `start += 1` increments `start` by 1.

Given that `start` is initially `0`, the first iteration of the loop will append `word[0]` to `result`, and then `start` will become `1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `word` or `i` from the initial state, let's assume `word` is "example" for illustration purposes (the actual value of `word` does not affect the final state since it only depends on the initial value of `start` and the operation performed).

After running the code, `result` will be `['e']` (since `word[0]` is 'e') and `start` will be `1`.

The final output state is:
Output State: **word is a non-empty string, i is the smallest index such that func_1(word[i]) returns True, start is 1, result is ['e']**
