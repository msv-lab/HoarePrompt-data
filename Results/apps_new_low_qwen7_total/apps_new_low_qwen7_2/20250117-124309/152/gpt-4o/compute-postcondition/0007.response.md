Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `func_1(word[2])` must return `False`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions in the loop head must be true.
   - The first condition is `i < n`.
   - The second condition is `(not func_1(word[i]))`.

4. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `n` is at least 1, but no specific value is given, just that it is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `func_1(word[2])` returns `False`.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again**:
   - To ensure `i < n` remains true, `i` should be less than `n`.
   - To ensure `(not func_1(word[i]))` remains true, we need to ensure that `func_1(word[i])` still returns `False` when `i` is incremented.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, incrementing `i` to 3 would make `i` equal to 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3.
   - We need to ensure that `func_1(word[3])` returns `False` when `i` is incremented to 3.

Given these considerations, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` such that the loop condition remains true.

**State Adjustment**:
- `i` must be less than `n` after incrementing.
- `n` must be greater than 3 to ensure the loop can execute again.
- `func_1(word[3])` must return `False` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state adjustments are:

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `func_1(word[3])` must return `False`**.
