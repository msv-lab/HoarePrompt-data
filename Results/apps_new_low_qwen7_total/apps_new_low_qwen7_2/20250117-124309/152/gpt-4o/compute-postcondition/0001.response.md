Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`.
2. **Current state of variables**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `n` is the length of `word` (an integer).
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 0.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `0 < n`.

Since `n` is the length of the string `word`, and `word` is a non-empty string, `n` must be at least 1.

4. **Final state required for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - `word` being a non-empty string is already sufficient for `n` to be at least 1.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is indeed at least 1.

So, the final state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`word` is a non-empty string and `n` is at least 1**
