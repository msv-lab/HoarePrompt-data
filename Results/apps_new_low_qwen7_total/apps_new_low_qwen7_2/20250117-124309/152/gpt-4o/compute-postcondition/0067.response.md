Let's analyze the given code and the provided output states step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is `while i < n and not func_1(word[i]):`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Track Variable Changes
- `i` starts from its initial value (`start`) and increments by 1 in each iteration until `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- `word` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `start` remains unchanged.
- `result` is updated based on whether the substring `word[start:i]` meets the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop increments `i` until it finds a character in `word` for which `func_1` returns `True`.
- During each iteration, if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, the substring `word[start:i]` is added to `result`. Otherwise, `word[start:i]` is added regardless.
- After the loop ends, `i` will be the first index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

### Verify Relationships
From the given output states, we can infer:
- After the loop executes 1 time, `i = start + 1`.
- After the loop executes 2 times, `i = start + 3`.
- After the loop executes 3 times, `i = start + 5`.

This pattern suggests that after `k` iterations, `i = start + 2k - 1`.

### Final Output State
After the loop finishes, `i` will be the first index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. Therefore, the final value of `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

The final state of `result` depends on the substrings that were added before `i` reached the point where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. Specifically, `result` contains all valid substrings `word[start:i]` that meet the conditions.

### Conclusion
The final output state after the loop has finished executing is:
Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, and `result` is a list of all substrings `word[start:i]` (where `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`) concatenated with any additional substrings `word[start:i]` that did not meet the length condition but were still included.
