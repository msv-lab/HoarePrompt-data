The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n`. After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

The other variables (`start`, `result`, `word`) remain unchanged because the code only modifies `i`. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n` incremented by 1, `start` is equal to the original `i`, and `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`**.
