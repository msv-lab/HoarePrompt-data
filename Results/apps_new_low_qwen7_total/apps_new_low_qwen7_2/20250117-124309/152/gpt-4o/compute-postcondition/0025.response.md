The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. This means that the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1. The other variables (`word`, `start`, `result`, `n`, `func_1`, and `func_2`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n` incremented by 1.
- `start` is equal to the original `i`.
- `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
- `n` must be greater than `i`.

After executing `i += 1`, the updated state is:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain in their initial or previously determined states.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n` incremented by 1, `start` is equal to the original `i`, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` must be greater than `i` and `i` has been incremented by 1.**
