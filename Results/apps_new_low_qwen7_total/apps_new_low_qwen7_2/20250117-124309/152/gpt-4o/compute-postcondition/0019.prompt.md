You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an else statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account that the program does not enter the if block and goes to the lese block instead. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE IF CONDITION IN THIS CASE. WE ENTER THE ELSE BLOCK.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after not entering the if block and instead enetering the else block . So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is false. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is more than or equal to 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` can have any value except an integer one`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive larger or equal to 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is a list of integers
if condition:
```
if n <=0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is larger than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's analyze the given Python loop step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the string `word` using index `i`. The condition `i < n and not func_1(word[i])` ensures that the loop continues as long as the index `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration until either `i` reaches `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- **`word`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`n`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue to increment `i` as long as the current character `word[i]` satisfies the condition `not func_1(word[i])`. Once `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for any `i`, or if `i` reaches `n`, the loop terminates.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
From the provided outputs, we can infer that:
- After 1 iteration, `i` is 1 and `func_1(word[0])` must return `False`.
- After 2 iterations, `i` is 2 and `func_1(word[1])` must return `False`.
- After 3 iterations, `i` is 4 and `func_1(word[3])` must return `False`.

This pattern suggests that `i` will be set to the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or it will be set to `n` if no such index exists.

### Final Output State
After the loop completes, the value of `i` will be the smallest index `j` where `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` will be equal to `n` if `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` for all `k < n`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, and `n` is at least 1.
if condition:
```
if (i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i])):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition .All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the negation of the if condition must also be included. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it does not enter the if condition and instead enters the else.
