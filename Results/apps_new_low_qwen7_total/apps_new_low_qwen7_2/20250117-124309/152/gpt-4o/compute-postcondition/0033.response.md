`i` is incremented by 1. The original value of `i` was the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`. After incrementing `i`, `i` is now one more than the previous value of `i`. The conditions for `result` and `start` remain unchanged since the code only modifies `i`.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n` plus 1, `start` is equal to the previous `i`, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False**
