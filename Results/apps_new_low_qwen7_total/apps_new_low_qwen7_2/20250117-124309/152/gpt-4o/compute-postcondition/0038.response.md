Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`, `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. The loop terminates when `i` reaches the next index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` or when `i` equals `n`.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
   - Each iteration increments `i` by 1 until it finds an index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` or reaches `n`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i`: Incremented by 1 in each iteration until `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`.
   - `start`: Initially set to the value of `i` before the loop starts and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `result`: Updated based on the value of `i` and `start` after each iteration, but its content depends on the conditions provided.
   - `n`: Remains constant and is always greater than `i + 1`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to increment `i` until either `i` equals `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
   - When the loop ends, `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`.
   - `start` retains its initial value.
   - `result` is determined based on the final value of `i` and `start` using the specified conditions.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The final state ensures that `i` is correctly identified as the largest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
   - `start` is consistent with the initial state.
   - `result` adheres to the conditions given for its update.

Thus, the final output state after the loop completes is as described above.
