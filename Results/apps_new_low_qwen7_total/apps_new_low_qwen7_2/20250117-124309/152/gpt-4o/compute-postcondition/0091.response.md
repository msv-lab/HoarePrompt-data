Functionality: **The function `func_3` takes a non-empty string `word` as input and processes it to create a list of substrings based on specific conditions. It then joins these substrings with spaces and returns the resulting string. The function iterates through the input string `word` and identifies segments of consecutive non-consonant characters. For each segment, if it meets the criteria (having a length of at least 3 and containing at least two different letters, as determined by `func_2`), it extracts the first two characters and appends the remaining characters one by one. If the segment does not meet the criteria, it simply appends the entire segment. The function also handles the case where the segment consists of only one character, which is always appended. The final state of the program includes the input string `word`, the index `i` pointing to the next consonant in `word`, the initial value of `i` stored in `start`, and the list `result` containing the processed substrings.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
1. If the input string `word` is very short (less than 3 characters), the function will still process it according to the defined rules.
2. If `func_1` or `func_2` are not defined or behave unexpectedly, the function may produce incorrect results. However, the code itself handles these cases correctly by ensuring that only valid segments are processed.
3. The function assumes that `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented and available during runtime. If `func_1` incorrectly marks consonants as vowels or `func_2` fails to identify blocks of consonants properly, the output will be affected.
