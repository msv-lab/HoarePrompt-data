Let's analyze the given code and initial state step-by-step to determine the output state after all executions of the loop have finished.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The initial state is as follows:
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the largest index \( j \) such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and \( j < n \).
- `start` is equal to the original \( i \) before any incrementation.
- `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to \( i-1 \) (inclusive) plus the substring `word[start:start+2]` if \( i - start \geq 5 \) and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`; otherwise, `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
- `n` is greater than \( i + 1 \).

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
The loop runs while `start < i`. During each iteration:
- `result` appends one character from `word[start:start + 1]`.
- `start` increments by 1.

#### Invariant Variables:
- `i` remains unchanged because it is determined only once initially.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is determined only once initially.
- `word` remains unchanged within the loop.

#### Variables Affected by the Loop:
- `start`: Initially equals `i` and increases by 1 in each iteration until `start == i`.
- `result`: Grows by appending one character from `word[start:start + 1]` in each iteration.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue to run until `start` equals `i`. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly `i - start` times. Since `start` starts at `i` and increments by 1 each time, the loop will run `0` times (if `start == i`) or `1` time less than `i - start` (if `start < i`).

After the loop completes, `start` will be equal to `i`. The value of `result` will be a list containing all characters from `start - (i - start)` to `i - 1` (inclusive), plus additional substrings based on the conditions specified in the initial state.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- If `start` equals `i` initially, the loop will not execute, and `result` will be the same as the initial state.
- If `start` is incremented by the loop, `result` will contain all characters from `start - (i - start)` to `i - 1` (inclusive) plus the appropriate substrings.

### Final Output State
Given the behavior of the loop and the initial conditions, the final state after the loop completes (assuming the loop executed some number of times) is:

- `start` will be `i`.
- `result` will contain all characters from `i - (i - i)` (which simplifies to `i - 0 = i`) to `i - 1` (inclusive), which means it contains all characters from `i - 1` to `i - 1` (a single character list). Plus, it may contain additional substrings based on the initial conditions.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **word is a non-empty string, i is the largest index \( j \) such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and \( j < n \), start is \( i \), result is a list containing the single character from \( i - 1 \) to \( i - 1 \) (inclusive) plus the substring `word[i-1:i+2]` if \( i - (i-1) \geq 5 \) and `func_2(word[i-1:i])` returns `True`; otherwise, `result` contains the previous elements plus the substring `word[i-1:i]`, n is greater than \( i + 1 \).**
