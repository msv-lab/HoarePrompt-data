You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: word is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, with a length between 1 and 3000. func_1 and func_2 are functions that determine if a letter is a consonant and if a block of consonants has at least two different letters, respectively.
def func_3(word):
    n = len(word)

result = []

i = 0
    while i < n:
        start = i
        
        while i < n and not func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        
        if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]):
            result.append(word[start:start + 2])
            start += 2
            while start < i:
                result.append(word[start:start + 1])
                start += 1
        else:
            result.append(word[start:i])
        
        while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        
        result.append(word[start:i])
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next index in `word` where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and no further characters satisfy this condition (or `n` if no such index exists), `start` is the initial value of `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list, and `n` is the length of `word`.
    #
    #- **Variables that remain constant throughout the loop:**
    #  - `n` (the length of `word`).
    #
    #- **Final values of all variables after the loop finishes:**
    #  - `word`: The input string.
    #  - `i`: The next index in `word` where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and no further characters satisfy this condition (or `n` if no such index exists).
    #  - `start`: The initial value of `i` before any incrementation.
    #  - `result`: A list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list.
    #
    #- **Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute:**
    #  - The outer `while` loop continues as long as `i < n`. Once `i` reaches or exceeds `n`, the loop terminates. The inner `while` loops also run based on the conditions specified within them.
    return ' '.join(result)
    #The program returns a string that is the result of joining all substrings in the list `result` with a space, where each substring `word[start:i]` either meets the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or does not meet these conditions but are still included in the list. The final values of `word`, `i`, `start`, and `result` are as described in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter word, and returns a string that joins all substrings from word in the list result with a space, where each substring either has a length of at least 3 and satisfies func_2, or is included without satisfying the conditions.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string that is the result of joining all substrings in the list `result` with a space, where each substring `word[start:i]` either meets the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or does not meet these conditions but are still included in the list. The final values of `word`, `i`, `start`, and `result` are as described in the initial state.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
