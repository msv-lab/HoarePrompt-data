Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given as:
   ```python
   while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
   ```

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is less than `n` and equals `original_i + 1`.
   - `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
     1. `i < n`
     2. `(not func_1(word[i]))`

4. **Analyze Each Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.
   - Additionally, `func_1(word[i])` must still return `False`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` must remain less than `n`, no adjustment is needed for `i` itself, but we need to ensure that `n` remains unchanged and `i` remains less than `n`.
   - We need to ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the next value of `i`.

Given the current state:
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is `original_i + 1` and must be less than `n`.
- `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following must be true:
- `i` should be incremented to `original_i + 2`.
- `func_1(word[i])` must still return `False` for the new value of `i`.

However, since we cannot directly change the return value of `func_1(word[i])`, we need to ensure that the next value of `i` satisfies the condition.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `i` must be `original_i + 2` (one more increment).
- `n` must remain unchanged.
- `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` for `i = original_i + 2`.

Thus, the state after the adjustment should be:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is original_i + 2, `n` is greater than or equal to original_i + 2, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`**.
