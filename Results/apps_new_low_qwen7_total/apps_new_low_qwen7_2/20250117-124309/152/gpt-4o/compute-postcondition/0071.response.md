Given the initial state where `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns True, and `start` is `i + 2` and must be less than `i`, let's analyze the provided code snippet:

```python
result.append(word[start:start + 1])
start += 1
```

Let's break down the steps:

1. **First Line: `result.append(word[start:start + 1])`**
   - `start` is `i + 2` and must be less than `i`. This means `start` is a negative index, which is not valid for a string in Python. However, for the sake of the problem, let's assume this condition is met (e.g., through some external logic or a hypothetical scenario).
   - Since `start` is `i + 2`, the slice `word[start:start + 1]` would attempt to get a substring starting at `i + 2` and ending at `i + 3`. Given that `start` is invalid, this slice would likely return an empty string (`''`).

2. **Second Line: `start += 1`**
   - After appending an empty string to `result`, `start` is incremented by 1. If `start` was `-1` initially (as it needs to be less than `i` and a valid negative index), then after this line, `start` would become `0`.

Given these steps, the changes to the variables are as follows:
- `result` gets an empty string appended.
- `start` is incremented by 1.

Since no other variables are mentioned or changed in the code snippet, we can conclude the following:
- `word` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `start` is now `0`.
- `result` contains one element, which is an empty string.

Final Output State: **word is a non-empty string, i is the smallest index such that func_1(word[i]) returns True, start is 0, result is ['']**
