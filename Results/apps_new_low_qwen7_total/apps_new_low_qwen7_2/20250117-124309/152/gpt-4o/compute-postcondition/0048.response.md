Postcondition: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`, `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. The loop terminates when `i` reaches the next index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` or when `i` equals `n`. Additionally, either `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `False`.**
