The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from `original_i + 4` to `original_i + 5`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `original_i + 5`, `n` is greater than or equal to `original_i + 2`, and `func_1(word[original_i + 4])` must return `False`.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `original_i + 5`, `n` is greater than or equal to `original_i + 2`, and `func_1(word[original_i + 4])` must return `False`**
