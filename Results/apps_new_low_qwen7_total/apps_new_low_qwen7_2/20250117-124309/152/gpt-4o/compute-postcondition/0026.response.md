Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n` incremented by 1.
   - `start` is equal to the original `i`.
   - `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
   - `n` must be greater than `i` and `i` has been incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the adjustments needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.
   - Since `i` is already incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` should still satisfy `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `i` is updated such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. Since we cannot assume the exact value of `i` after the loop condition is checked, we just need to ensure that the next `i` meets the criteria.

Here's the modified state:

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n` (incremented by 1), `start` is equal to the original `i`, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` must be greater than `i` (incremented by 1)**.

However, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next valid index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n`.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n` (incremented by 1), `start` is equal to the original `i`, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` must be greater than `i` (incremented by 1), and `i` must be set to the next index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n`**.
