Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is `start + 1`.
   - `start` is equal to the original `i` before incrementation.
   - `result` is updated based on the new `i` value.
   - `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
   - From the current state, we know `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute again, which means `i` must still be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must still return `False` for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, `i` needs to be incremented, but it must still be less than `n` for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented and remains within the bounds specified by `n`.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `i` should be incremented from `start + 1` to `start + 2` to check the next character in the string.
   - `i` must still be less than `n` for the loop to execute again.
   - No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

So, the final state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `start + 2`, `start` is equal to the original `i` before incrementation, `result` is updated based on the new `i` value, and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` and `i` must be less than `n`**
