Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `start < i`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns True.
   - `start` is the value of `i` plus 2.
   - `result` is a list containing all previously valid substrings and the additional substring `word[start:start + 2]`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `start` must be less than `i`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Given that `start = i + 2`, for the condition `start < i` to be false, `start` must be greater than or equal to `i`. However, since we want the loop to execute at least once, `start` must be strictly less than `i`.
   - This means `i + 2` must be less than `i`, which is impossible directly. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i + 2` is set such that it is less than `i`, which implies `i` must be set such that `i + 2` is indeed less than `i`, which is not possible under normal circumstances.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `start = i + 2` and `start` must be less than `i` for the loop to execute, this scenario is inherently contradictory unless there is a mistake in the setup or the initial conditions are adjusted accordingly.

Given the contradiction, let's assume the intention is to set up the initial conditions such that the loop can execute at least once. We need to adjust `i` and `start` appropriately.

To make the loop executable, `i` should be set such that `i + 2` is less than `i`, which isn't feasible without adjusting the problem constraints. However, assuming the problem intends to find a way to make the loop execute, we can infer that `i` should be set such that `i + 2` is just less than `i`, but practically, we would need to adjust the initial setup.

For the sake of this exercise, we'll assume the initial conditions are set correctly and the loop can execute as intended.

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns True, `start` is `i + 2` and must be less than `i`** (which is not possible under normal circumstances).

Since this is a theoretical exercise, we can conclude that the initial conditions need to be adjusted to make the loop executable. 

However, based on the provided format and understanding, the answer would be:

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns True, `start` is `i + 2` and must be less than `i`**.
