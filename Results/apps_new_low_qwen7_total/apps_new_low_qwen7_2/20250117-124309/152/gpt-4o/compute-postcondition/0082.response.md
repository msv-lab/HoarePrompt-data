Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop condition is `i < n and func_1(word[i])`.

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`, as well as the function `func_1(word[i])`.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is `start + 1`.
   - `start` is the initial value of `i`.
   - `result` is a list containing specific substrings.
   - `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.
   - Since `i` is currently `start + 1`, and `start` is the initial value of `i`, `i` needs to be adjusted to ensure it meets the condition `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` is `True`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` must be one index further from its current position and must satisfy the condition `func_1(word[i])` is `True`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `start + 2`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.**
