Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `while start < i`.
   - This means the loop will continue as long as `start` is less than `i`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the smallest index \( j \) such that `func_1(word[j])` returns True or `i` equals `n`, where `n` is at least 1.
   - `start` is increased by 1.
   - `result` is a list containing one more element which is a character at `start` and a substring from `start` to `start + 2`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must be less than `i`.
   - Since `start` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to ensure that `start` is still less than `i` for the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `word` is a non-empty string (no need to change this).
- `i` is already defined based on the function `func_1` and the value of `n`.
- `start` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is less than `i` for the next iteration.
- `result` is updated but doesn't affect the loop condition directly.

To satisfy the loop condition `start < i` for the next iteration:
- `start` must be at least 1 less than `i` (since `start` is incremented by 1 each iteration).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `start` is at least one less than `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index \( j \) such that `func_1(word[j])` returns True or `i` equals `n`, where `n` is at least 1, `start` must be less than `i`, and `result` is a list containing one more element which is a character at `start` and a substring from `start` to `start + 2`**.
