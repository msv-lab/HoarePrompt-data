Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop condition is `i < n`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`.
   - `start` is equal to the original `i`.
   - `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
   - `n` is greater than `i`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must hold true.
   - Since `n` is already defined as being greater than `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` can increase and still satisfy the condition `i < n`.
   - After the current iteration, `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`.
   - To ensure the loop executes again, `i` must be set to the next valid index where `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`.

Given these points, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `i` can increment to the next valid index.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`, `start` is equal to the original `i`, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`**.
