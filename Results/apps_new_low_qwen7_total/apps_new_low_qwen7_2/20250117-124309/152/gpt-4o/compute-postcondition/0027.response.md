The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` was previously the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n` (incremented by 1). After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` is the next index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n`. The other variables (`word`, `start`, `result`, and `n`) remain unchanged because the code does not affect them.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n`, `start` is equal to the original `i`, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` must be greater than `i`**
