Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact of each line on the variables and determine the final state.

**Initial State:**
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- `start` is the initial value of `i`.
- `result` is a list of all substrings `word[start:i]` (where `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`), concatenated with any additional substrings `word[start:i]` that did not meet the length condition but were still included, and the condition `(i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]))` is satisfied.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
result.append(word[start:start + 2])
start += 2
```

Let's break down the effects of these two lines:

1. **Line 1:** `result.append(word[start:start + 2])`
   - This line appends a substring of `word` starting at `start` and ending at `start + 2` (non-inclusive) to the `result` list.
   - The length of this substring is 2, which is less than the required 3 characters. Therefore, it will not satisfy the condition `(i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]))`, and thus, it is included in the `result` list but does not fulfill the main condition for inclusion.

2. **Line 2:** `start += 2`
   - This line updates the `start` variable by adding 2 to its current value. Now, `start` points to the character two positions ahead of its original value.

Since no other variables are affected, we can summarize the final state as follows:

- The `word` string remains unchanged.
- The `i` value remains unchanged as the `start` variable is updated but not `i`.
- The `result` list now contains the additional substring `word[start:start + 2]` appended to it.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **word is a non-empty string, i is the smallest index such that func_1(word[i]) returns True, start is the value of i plus 2, result is a list containing all previously valid substrings and the additional substring word[start:start + 2]**
