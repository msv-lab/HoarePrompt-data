You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an else statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account that the program does not enter the if block and goes to the lese block instead. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE IF CONDITION IN THIS CASE. WE ENTER THE ELSE BLOCK.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after not entering the if block and instead enetering the else block . So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is false. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is more than or equal to 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` can have any value except an integer one`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive larger or equal to 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is a list of integers
if condition:
```
if n <=0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is larger than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's analyze the given code and the provided output states step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is `while i < n and not func_1(word[i]):`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Track Variable Changes
- `i` starts from its initial value (`start`) and increments by 1 in each iteration until `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- `word` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `start` remains unchanged.
- `result` is updated based on whether the substring `word[start:i]` meets the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop increments `i` until it finds a character in `word` for which `func_1` returns `True`.
- During each iteration, if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, the substring `word[start:i]` is added to `result`. Otherwise, `word[start:i]` is added regardless.
- After the loop ends, `i` will be the first index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

### Verify Relationships
From the given output states, we can infer:
- After the loop executes 1 time, `i = start + 1`.
- After the loop executes 2 times, `i = start + 3`.
- After the loop executes 3 times, `i = start + 5`.

This pattern suggests that after `k` iterations, `i = start + 2k - 1`.

### Final Output State
After the loop finishes, `i` will be the first index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. Therefore, the final value of `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

The final state of `result` depends on the substrings that were added before `i` reached the point where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. Specifically, `result` contains all valid substrings `word[start:i]` that meet the conditions.

### Conclusion
The final output state after the loop has finished executing is:
Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, and `result` is a list of all substrings `word[start:i]` (where `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`) concatenated with any additional substrings `word[start:i]` that did not meet the length condition but were still included.
if condition:
```
if (i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i])):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition .All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the negation of the if condition must also be included. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it does not enter the if condition and instead enters the else.
