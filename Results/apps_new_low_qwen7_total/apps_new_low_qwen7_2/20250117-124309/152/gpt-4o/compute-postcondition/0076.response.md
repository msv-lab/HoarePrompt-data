Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

### Initial State
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns True.
- `start` is the value of `i` plus 2.
- `result` is a list containing all previously valid substrings and the additional substring `word[start:start + 2]`.

### Code of the Loop
```python
while start < i:
    result.append(word[start:start + 1])
    start += 1
```

### Analysis
1. **Invariants and Variables:**
   - **Invariant:** The loop will continue to execute as long as `start < i`.
   - **Variables Changed:** 
     - `start`: Incremented by 1 each iteration.
     - `result`: Appends `word[start:start + 1]` to the list each iteration.

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop starts with `start = i + 2`.
   - The loop runs until `start` reaches `i`.
   - During each iteration, `result` appends a single character substring starting from `start` position.
   - `start` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

3. **Example Iterations:**
   - **First Iteration:** `start` is initially `i + 2`. Append `word[i+2:i+3]` to `result`, then increment `start` to `i + 3`.
   - **Second Iteration:** `start` is now `i + 3`. Append `word[i+3:i+4]` to `result`, then increment `start` to `i + 4`.
   - This process continues until `start` equals `i`.

4. **Final State Calculation:**
   - After `n` iterations, `start` will be `i + n`.
   - The loop will stop when `start` equals `i`, meaning `n = i - (i + 2) = -2` (which is incorrect; actually, it stops when `start == i`).
   - In practice, `start` will increment until it reaches `i`, so the loop will run `i - (i + 2) + 1 = -1` times, which means it will run 0 times if `i > start`.

### Conclusion
- If `start` is already `i`, the loop won't execute at all.
- Otherwise, the loop will execute `i - (i + 2) + 1 = -1` times, which is effectively 0 times.

### Final Output State
Since the loop does not execute, `result` remains as the initial value, and `start` remains `i + 2`.

Output State: **word is a non-empty string, i is the smallest index such that func_1(word[i]) returns True, start is i + 2, result is a list containing all previously valid substrings and the additional substring word[start:start + 2]**.
