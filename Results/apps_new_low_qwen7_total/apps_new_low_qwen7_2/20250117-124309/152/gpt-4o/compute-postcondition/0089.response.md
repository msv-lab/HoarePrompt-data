Output State: **The program returns a string that is the result of joining all substrings in the list `result` with a space, where each substring `word[start:i]` either meets the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or does not meet these conditions but are still included in the list. The final values of `word`, `i`, `start`, and `result` are as described in the initial state.**
