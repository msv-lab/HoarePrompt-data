The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was 3, so now `i` is 4. The value of `n` is still greater than 3, and the condition `func_1(word[3])` must still return `False`. Therefore, the Output State is: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, and `func_1(word[3])` must return `False`.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, and `func_1(word[3])` must return `False`**
