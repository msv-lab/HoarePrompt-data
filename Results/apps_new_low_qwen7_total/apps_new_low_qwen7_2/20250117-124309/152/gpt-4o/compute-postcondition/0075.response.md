The initial state is as follows:
- `word` is a non-empty string
- `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns True and `i` must be greater than 1
- `start` is 1
- `result` is `['e']`

Let's analyze the code block:

```python
result.append(word[start:start + 1])
start += 1
```

1. **First Line (`result.append(word[start:start + 1])`):**
   - This line appends the substring of `word` starting at index `start` and ending just before `start + 1` to the list `result`.
   - Since `start` is initially 1, this means appending `word[1]` to `result`.
   - Given that `result` starts as `['e']`, if `word[1]` is different from 'e', the new `result` will be `['e', word[1]]`.

2. **Second Line (`start += 1`):**
   - This line increments `start` by 1, so `start` becomes 2.

Now, let's combine these effects:

- The first line modifies `result` by adding the character at index 1 of `word` to the existing elements in `result`.
- The second line modifies `start` by setting it to 2.

Since we don't know the exact value of `word` or the exact value that `func_1` returns, we can't determine the exact character at index 1 of `word`. However, we do know that `i` (the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns True and `i` must be greater than 1) is correctly determined before the code block starts.

Therefore, the final state after executing the code block is:
- `result` will contain `['e']` followed by the character at index 1 of `word`.
- `start` will be 2.

Output State: **result is ['e', word[1]], start is 2**
