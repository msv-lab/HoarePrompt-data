Output State: **word is a non-empty string, i is the smallest index j such that func_1(word[j]) returns True or i equals n, start is incremented by 1, result is a list containing the character at start and a substring from start to start + 2**

Explanation:
- The first line `result.append(word[start:start + 1])` appends the character at the position `start` to the list `result`.
- The second line `start += 1` increments the value of `start` by 1.
- The values of `word`, `i`, `n`, and `func_1` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The value of `result` is updated to include the character at the original `start` position and a substring starting from `start` up to `start + 2`.

Since we do not have the actual values of `word`, `i`, `n`, and `func_1`, we keep them as described in the initial state. The only changes are to `start` and `result`.
