You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing the overall postcondition of Hoare triples for if statements based on the postconditions of the if and the else part. In addition to the Hoare triples, you will also see the postconditions for the if and else parts. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This contains the condition of the if statement and if there is an else part there will also be an else: in the program fragment.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. You need to strictly follow the format and summarize the if statement in a coherent paragraph, rather than discussing it in separate paragraphs.

The if part : the postcondition of the if part

The else part : the postcondition of the else part

Combine the postconditions of the if and else part(if an else exists), taking into account the if condition,  to get the overall postcondition of the if else block

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
Program Fragment:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```
If part: `str` is a string with lenght less than 3, the function returns None
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, if the length of `str` is less then 3, the function return None***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
Program Fragment:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
    
else:
    
```

If part: n is an integer of any value and the function returns `n`
Else part: n can have any value except an integer one and the function returns `int(n)`

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***if `n` is integer, then the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function return `int(n)`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
Program Fragment:
```
if x < 2:
   
else:
    
```

If part: `x` is an positive integer less than 2, the function returns False
Else part: `x` is an positive integer larger or equal to 2 and the function returns True

Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer, if x is less then 2, the function return False. Otherwise, the function return True***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer
Program Fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    
else:
    
```
if part: the integer n was originally negative and `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1
else part: if n is 0 then return m , otherwise the integer `n` is decreased by 13. Integer `m` is increased by 1

Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. If n < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If n == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, y is zero.
Program Fragment:
```
if x > 0:
```
If part: `x` is a positive integer, if `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If x is larger than 0 but lower than 10, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's analyze the given Python loop step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the string `word` using index `i`. The condition `i < n and not func_1(word[i])` ensures that the loop continues as long as the index `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration until either `i` reaches `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- **`word`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`n`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue to increment `i` as long as the current character `word[i]` satisfies the condition `not func_1(word[i])`. Once `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for any `i`, or if `i` reaches `n`, the loop terminates.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
From the provided outputs, we can infer that:
- After 1 iteration, `i` is 1 and `func_1(word[0])` must return `False`.
- After 2 iterations, `i` is 2 and `func_1(word[1])` must return `False`.
- After 3 iterations, `i` is 4 and `func_1(word[3])` must return `False`.

This pattern suggests that `i` will be set to the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or it will be set to `n` if no such index exists.

### Final Output State
After the loop completes, the value of `i` will be the smallest index `j` where `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` will be equal to `n` if `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` for all `k < n`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, and `n` is at least 1.
Program Fragment:
```
if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]):
else:

```
if part: word is a non-empty string, i is the smallest index j such that func_1(word[j]) returns True or i equals n, start is equal to i, result is a list containing all characters from start to i-1 (inclusive).
else part: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, and `n` is at least 1, and either `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `False`; `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.

Your task is to complete the overall postcondition of the whole if else block. Summarise all the cases and give the overall state of the program after the if else executes. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
