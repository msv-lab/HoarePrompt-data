The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `word`. `word` is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000. The function processes this string and returns a string that is the result of joining all substrings in the list `result` with a space, where each substring `word[start:i]` either meets the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or does not meet these conditions but are still included in the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter word, and returns a string that joins all substrings from word in the list result with a space, where each substring either has a length of at least 3 and satisfies func_2, or is included without satisfying the conditions.**
