Based on the provided code snippet and the initial state analysis, let's step through the code to determine the final output state.

### Initial State:
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- `start` is the initial value of `i`.
- `result` is a list that contains all substrings `word[start:i]` under certain conditions.

### Code Snippet:
```python
result.append(word[start:i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Current State:**
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
   - `start` is the initial value of `i`.
   - `result` is a list containing substrings `word[start:i]` that meet certain conditions.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The code appends the substring `word[start:i]` to the list `result`.

3. **Update the Variables:**
   - `word` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `start` remains unchanged.
   - `result` now includes the new substring `word[start:i]`.

### Final Output State:
The final state of the variables after the code snippet is executed will be:
- `word` remains a non-empty string.
- `i` remains the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- `start` remains the initial value of `i`.
- `result` is updated to include the new substring `word[start:i]`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list, and `result` now includes the new substring `word[start:i]`.**
