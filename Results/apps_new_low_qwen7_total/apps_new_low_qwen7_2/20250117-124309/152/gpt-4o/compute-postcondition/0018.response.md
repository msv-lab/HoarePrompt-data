Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, where `n` is at least 1.
- `start` is an integer.
- The current value of `i` minus `start` is greater than or equal to 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`.
- `result` is a list containing one more element which is a substring of `word` from `start` to `start + 2`.
- `start` is increased by 2.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
while start < i:
    result.append(word[start:start + 1])
    start += 1
```

### Analysis of Loop Execution:
1. **Variable `i`:** This variable remains constant as it is determined by the initial state and is not modified within the loop.
2. **Variable `n`:** Not explicitly mentioned to be changed in the loop.
3. **Variable `func_1(word[j])`:** This function determines `i` but is not altered by the loop.
4. **Variable `start`:** Incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
5. **Variable `result`:** Appends a single character from `word[start:start+1]` in each iteration.
6. **Variable `func_2(word[start:i])`:** The condition for the loop to continue is `start < i`. Given that `start` is increased by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue until `start` is no longer less than `i`.

### Loop Execution Behavior:
- The loop continues to append characters from `word` starting from `start` until `start` reaches `i`.
- Each time the loop runs, `start` increases by 1, and `result` appends the next character of `word` starting from `start`.

### Output State After the Loop Finishes:
- **Condition for Loop Execution:** The loop continues as long as `start < i`. When `start` becomes equal to `i`, the loop stops.
- **Final Value of `start`:** `start` will be equal to `i` when the loop exits.
- **Final Value of `result`:** `result` will contain all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) because in each iteration, a single character is appended to `result`.
- **Final Value of `i`:** Remains unchanged as it is determined by the initial state and not modified in the loop.
- **Final Value of `n`:** Remains unchanged as it is determined by the initial state and not modified in the loop.
- **Final Value of `func_1(word[j])`:** Remains unchanged as it is used to determine `i` initially and not modified in the loop.
- **Final Value of `func_2(word[start:i])`:** Since the loop continues until `start` equals `i`, the condition `func_2(word[start:i])` should still hold true.

### Summary of Output State:
- `word` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `start` is equal to `i`.
- `result` contains all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive).

### Output State:
Output State: **word is a non-empty string, i is the smallest index j such that func_1(word[j]) returns True or i equals n, start is equal to i, result is a list containing all characters from start to i-1 (inclusive).**
