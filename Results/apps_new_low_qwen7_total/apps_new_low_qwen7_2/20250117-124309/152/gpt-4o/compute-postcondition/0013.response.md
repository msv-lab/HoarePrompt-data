Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the effects of the code on the variables.

Initial State:
- `word` is a non-empty string
- `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, where `n` is at least 1
- `start` is an integer
- `start` is increased by 2 so that `start - i` is greater than or equal to 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`
- `result` is a list containing one more element which is a substring of `word` from `start` to `start + 2`

Code Snippet:
```python
result.append(word[start:start + 1])
start += 1
```

Let's break down the effects of these two lines of code:

1. `result.append(word[start:start + 1])`: This line appends a substring of `word` from `start` to `start + 1` (which is just `start`) to the list `result`. This means the last element of `result` will be the character at index `start`.

2. `start += 1`: This line increments `start` by 1.

Since `start` is increased by 1, the next time the condition for appending to `result` is checked, it will involve the character at `start + 1`.

The value of `i` and `n` are not changed by these lines, nor is `func_1` or `func_2` called again. Therefore, their values remain as they were initially.

Output State:
- `word` remains unchanged
- `i` remains unchanged
- `n` remains unchanged
- `start` is increased by 1
- `result` now contains the substring from `start` to `start + 2` as well as the character at `start` (from the last append)

Thus, the updated state is:
- `word` is a non-empty string
- `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, where `n` is at least 1
- `start` is increased by 1 compared to the initial state
- `result` is a list containing substrings and characters as described above

Output State: **word is a non-empty string, i is the smallest index j such that func_1(word[j]) returns True or i equals n, where n is at least 1, start is increased by 1, result is a list containing one more element which is a character at start and a substring from start to start + 2**
