Let's analyze the conditions required for the loop to execute at least once:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`.
   - `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation.
   - `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
   - `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute, both conditions inside the `while` loop must be satisfied: `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.

4. **Analyzing Conditions**:
   - Since `i` is defined as the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`, we know that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` initially.
   - The only condition left to ensure the loop executes is `i < n`. Given that `n` is defined as being greater than `i + 1`, `i < n` is already guaranteed.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time because `i < n` is already satisfied given the definition of `n`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`, `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.**
