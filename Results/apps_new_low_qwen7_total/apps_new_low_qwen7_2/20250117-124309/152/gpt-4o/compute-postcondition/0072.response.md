Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `start < i`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
   - `start` is `0`.
   - `result` is `['']`.

3. **Check the loop condition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - Since `start` is `0` and `i` is the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, the loop will execute as long as `0 < i`.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must be less than `i`.
   - Currently, `start` is `0` and `i` is the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. Therefore, `start` (which is `0`) is already less than `i`.
   - No adjustment is needed for `start` because it is already in a position where the loop condition is satisfied.
   - The loop condition depends on both `start` and `i`, but since `start` is fixed at `0` and `i` remains the same, no change is required.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, `start` is `0`, `result` is `['']`**
