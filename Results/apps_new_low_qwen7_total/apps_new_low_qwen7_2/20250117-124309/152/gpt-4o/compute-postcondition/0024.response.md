Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Understanding the Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

### States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n` has been incremented by 1.
- `start` is equal to the original `i`.
- `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.

### Loop Head Variables
The loop head variables are `i` and `n`. We need to ensure these variables are set in such a way that the loop condition `i < n and func_1(word[i])` holds true for the next iteration.

### Adjusting the States
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` should be such that `i < n` holds true.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the loop, `n` must be at least `i + 1` to ensure the loop continues.

### Ensuring the Next Iteration
To ensure the loop executes one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1 (which happens automatically within the loop).
- `n` must remain the same or be adjusted to ensure `i < n`.

### Final State Adjustment
Since `i` is incremented by 1 automatically, we only need to ensure that `n` remains the same and is still greater than `i`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than `i`.

### Final Answer
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n` incremented by 1, `start` is equal to the original `i`, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` must be greater than `i`**.
