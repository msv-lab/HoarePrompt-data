The code `start = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `start`. This means that `start` now holds the same value as `i` did before this assignment. The other variables (`word`, `i`, `result`, and `n`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is less than `n`, `start` is equal to the previous value of `i`, `result` is a list containing the substring `word[start:i]` if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`**.
