Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is `while start < i`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop continuation**: The loop continues as long as `start < i`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`.
   - `start` is incremented by `1`.
   - `result` is a list containing the character at `start` and a substring from `start` to `start + 2`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - Since `start` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration, let's denote the new value of `start` as `start_new`.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `start_new` must be less than `i`.
   - Therefore, `start_new` should be adjusted to be less than `i`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `start + 1` (the new value of `start`) is less than `i`. 

**Final Answer**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, `start` is incremented by `1`, and `start + 1` is less than `i`, `result` is a list containing the character at `start` and a substring from `start` to `start + 2`**.
