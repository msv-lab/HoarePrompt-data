The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `i` was the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`. After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` will be one more than the original value. However, the value of `i` must still satisfy the condition that `j < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. 

Since the value of `i` has increased by 1, the new value of `i` is the next index in the string `word` that satisfies the condition `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` (or simply `func_1(word[i])`), assuming there exists such an index.

The other variables remain unchanged: `start` remains equal to the original `i` before incrementation, `result` contains its original value, and `n` remains greater than `i + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `start` remains the same.
- `result` remains the same.
- `n` remains greater than `i + 1`.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n` plus 1, `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.**
