Given the initial state where `word` is a non-empty string of small English letters, and `func_1` and `func_2` are functions that determine if a letter is a consonant and if a block of consonants has at least two different letters, respectively, we need to analyze the following code block:

```python
n = len(word)
result = []
i = 0
```

Let's break down the effects of each line of the code on the variables:

1. `n = len(word)`: This line calculates the length of the string `word` and stores it in the variable `n`. `n` will now hold an integer value equal to the number of characters in `word`.

2. `result = []`: This line initializes an empty list named `result`. No other variables are affected by this line.

3. `i = 0`: This line sets the variable `i` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line.

Since there are no further operations in the provided code snippet, the final state of the program is determined by the values set in these lines.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **word is a non-empty string, n is the length of word (an integer), result is an empty list, i is 0**
