Based on the given code snippet and the initial state, let's analyze the effects of the two lines:

1. `result.append(word[start:start + 1])`: This line appends a single character from `word` starting at index `start` to the `result` list.
2. `start += 1`: This line increments the value of `start` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the largest index \( j \) such that `func_1(word[j])` returns True and \( j < n \).
- `start` is equal to the original \( i \) before any incrementation.
- `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to \( i-1 \) (inclusive) plus the substring `word[start:start+2]` if \( i - start \ge 5 \) and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns True, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
- `n` is greater than \( i + 1 \) and `start` must be less than \( i \).

Since we don't know the exact values of `word`, `i`, `start`, and `result`, let's consider a general case where `i` is some index in the word, and `start` is initialized to `i`.

After running the code:
- `result` will have one more character appended to it, which is `word[start]`.
- `start` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, the final state will be:
- `word` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `start` is now `i + 1`.
- `result` is updated to include the character at index `start` (which is `i + 1`).

Output State: **word is a non-empty string, i is the largest index j such that func_1(word[j]) returns True and j < n, start is i + 1, result is a list containing all characters from start to i-1 (inclusive) plus the substring word[start:start+2] if i - start >= 5 and func_2(word[start:i]) returns True, otherwise result is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring word[start:i], n is greater than i + 1**
