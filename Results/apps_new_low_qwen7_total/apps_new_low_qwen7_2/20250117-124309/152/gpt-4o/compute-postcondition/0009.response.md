Let's analyze the given Python loop step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the string `word` using index `i`. The condition `i < n and not func_1(word[i])` ensures that the loop continues as long as the index `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration until either `i` reaches `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- **`word`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`n`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue to increment `i` as long as the current character `word[i]` satisfies the condition `not func_1(word[i])`. Once `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for any `i`, or if `i` reaches `n`, the loop terminates.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
From the provided outputs, we can infer that:
- After 1 iteration, `i` is 1 and `func_1(word[0])` must return `False`.
- After 2 iterations, `i` is 2 and `func_1(word[1])` must return `False`.
- After 3 iterations, `i` is 4 and `func_1(word[3])` must return `False`.

This pattern suggests that `i` will be set to the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or it will be set to `n` if no such index exists.

### Final Output State
After the loop completes, the value of `i` will be the smallest index `j` where `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` will be equal to `n` if `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` for all `k < n`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, and `n` is at least 1.
