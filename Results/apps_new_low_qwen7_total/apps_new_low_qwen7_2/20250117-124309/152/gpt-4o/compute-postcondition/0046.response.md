Given the initial state:
- `word` is a non-empty string
- `i` is the largest index \( j \) such that `func_1(word[j])` returns True and \( j < n \)
- `start` is \( i + 1 \)
- `result` is a list containing all characters from \( \text{start}-1 \) to \( i-1 \) (inclusive) plus the substring `word[start-1:start+2]` if \( i - \text{start} + 1 \geq 5 \) and `func_2(word[start-1:i])` returns True; otherwise, `result` contains the previous elements plus the substring `word[start-1:i]`
- `n` is greater than \( i + 1 \)

The code snippet is:
```python
result.append(word[start:start + 1])
start += 1
```

Let's analyze the impact of these lines:

1. `result.append(word[start:start + 1])`: This line appends the character at index `start` of the string `word` to the list `result`.
2. `start += 1`: This line increments the value of `start` by 1.

After executing these lines, we need to consider the updated values of `result` and `start`.

### Updated Values:
- `start` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `start` is \( i + 2 \).
- `result` now includes the character at index `start - 1` (which was the character at index \( i + 1 \)).

### Updated `result`:
The previous definition of `result` was based on the conditions involving `i` and `start`. After appending the character at `start - 1` (which was the character at \( i + 1 \)), the updated `result` should still follow the same logic as before, but now it includes one more character.

Since the exact content of `word` and the function results (`func_1` and `func_2`) are not specified, we can't determine the exact characters or substrings included in `result` without that information. However, we know that the last character appended to `result` is the one at `start - 1` (which was originally at `i + 1`).

### Final Output State:
The final state after the code execution, given the above analysis, would be:
Output State: **`i` is the largest index \( j \) such that `func_1(word[j])` returns True and \( j < n \), `start` is \( i + 2 \), `result` is a list containing all characters from \( \text{start}-2 \) to \( i-1 \) (inclusive) plus the substring `word[start-2:start+1]` if \( i - \text{start} + 1 \geq 5 \) and `func_2(word[start-2:i])` returns True; otherwise, `result` contains the previous elements plus the substring `word[start-2:i]`, `n` is greater than \( i + 1 \)**
