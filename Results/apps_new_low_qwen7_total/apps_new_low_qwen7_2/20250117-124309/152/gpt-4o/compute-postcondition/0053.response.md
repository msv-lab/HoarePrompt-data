To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head conditions and see how they change from the end of the previous iteration.

### Loop Head Conditions
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the largest index \( j \) such that \( func_1(word[j]) \) returns `True` and \( j < n \) plus 1.
- `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation.
- `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if \( i - start \ge 3 \) and \( func_2(word[start:i]) \) returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

### Analysis
For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the while loop need to be satisfied:
1. \( i < n \)
2. \( func_1(word[i]) \)

#### Condition 1: \( i < n \)
- The current state says `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
- For the loop to continue, \( i \) must be less than \( n \).
- Since \( n > i + 1 \), \( i \) is already less than \( n \). Therefore, no adjustment is needed for this condition.

#### Condition 2: \( func_1(word[i]) \)
- This condition depends on the value of `word[i]`.
- The current state does not provide information about \( func_1(word[i]) \).
- We need to ensure that \( func_1(word[i]) \) returns `True` for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion
The only condition that might need to be adjusted is related to the function call \( func_1(word[i]) \). However, since the problem states that the loop should proceed, we assume that \( func_1(word[i]) \) returns `True` for the next iteration.

### Final State Adjustment
Since no specific adjustments are needed for the given conditions, the state remains the same as described in the previous iteration.

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index \( j \) such that \( func_1(word[j]) \) returns `True` and \( j < n \) plus 1, `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if \( i - start \ge 3 \) and \( func_2(word[start:i]) \) returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.**
