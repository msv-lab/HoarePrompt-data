Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the variables step by step.

**Initial State:**
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`.
- `start` must be less than `i`.
- `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) plus the substring `word[start:start+2]` if `i - start >= 5` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

**Code Snippet:**
```
result.append(word[start:start + 1])
start += 1
```

Let's break down the impact of each line:

1. **First Line: `result.append(word[start:start + 1])`**
   - This line appends the character at index `start` in `word` to the `result` list.
   - After this operation, the last element in `result` will be `word[start]`.

2. **Second Line: `start += 1`**
   - This line increments the value of `start` by 1.
   - The new value of `start` will be `start + 1`.

**Final State:**
- `word` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `start` is incremented by 1.
- `result` is updated to include the character at index `start - 1` in `word` (the character just before the increment).
- `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final state after executing the given code snippet is:

Output State: **word is a non-empty string, i is the largest index j such that func_1(word[j]) returns True and j < n, start is i, result is a list containing all characters from start-1 to i-1 (inclusive) plus the substring word[start-1:start+2] if i - start + 1 >= 5 and func_2(word[start-1:i]) returns True, otherwise result is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring word[start-1:i], n is greater than i + 1**
