`i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `start + 1`. The value of `start` remains unchanged. The value of `result` is updated based on the new value of `i`, and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`. The state of `word` and `n` is unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `start + 1`, `start` is equal to the original `i` before incrementation, `result` is updated based on the new `i` value, and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `start + 1`, `start` is equal to the original `i` before incrementation, `result` is updated based on the new `i` value, and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`**
