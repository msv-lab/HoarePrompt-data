Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `start < i`.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The loop condition involves two variables: `start` and `i`.
3. **Current state of the variables**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `start` is an integer.
   - `i - start` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`.
   - `result` is a list containing one more element which is a substring of `word` from `start` to `start + 2`.
   - `start` is increased by 2.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop `while start < i` to execute at least once, `start` must be less than `i`.
   - Given the current state, we know that `i - start` is at least 3, meaning `i` is at least 3 greater than `start`. Therefore, `start` is indeed less than `i`.

Since the current state already ensures that `start < i`, no further adjustments are necessary.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, `n` is at least 1, `start` is an integer, and the current value of `i` minus `start` is greater than or equal to 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, `result` is a list containing one more element which is a substring of `word` from `start` to `start + 2`, `start` is increased by 2**
