To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions under which the loop can continue.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while start < i:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `start` is less than `i`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`.
- `start` is `i + 1`.
- `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) plus the substring `word[start:start+2]` if `i - start >= 5` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

### Determining the Next State
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `start < i` must be true. Given that `start` is initially set to `i + 1` and the loop continues as long as `start < i`, the only way for the loop to continue is if `start` becomes less than `i` during the loop body.

However, since `start` is incremented or modified within the loop body, and the loop condition checks if `start < i`, we need to ensure that `start` can eventually become less than `i` in the next iteration.

Given that `start` is initially `i + 1`, and the loop condition is `start < i`, this condition cannot be satisfied in the current state. Therefore, we need to modify `start` to be less than `i` for the loop to proceed.

### Adjusted States
- The only variable involved in the loop head is `start`, so we need to adjust `start` to be less than `i`.

### Final Answer
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`, `start` must be less than `i`, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) plus the substring `word[start:start+2]` if `i - start >= 5` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
