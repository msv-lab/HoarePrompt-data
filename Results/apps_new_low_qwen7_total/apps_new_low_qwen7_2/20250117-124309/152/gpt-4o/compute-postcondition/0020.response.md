`result.append(word[start:i])` appends a slice of the string `word` from index `start` to index `i` (exclusive) to the list `result`. The variables `word`, `i`, `start`, and `n` are not directly affected by this line of code. The precondition states that `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, and `n` is at least 1, and either `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `False`. Since the code does not change these conditions, they remain valid.

After the code execution, `result` will contain one additional element, which is the substring `word[start:i]`.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, and `n` is at least 1, and either `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `False`; `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.**
