Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is `start + 1`.
   - `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation.
   - `result` is a list containing the substring `word[start:i]` if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
   - `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

3. **Determine Which States Need Adjustment**:
   - The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `n` is already greater than `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the key is to ensure `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently `start + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`, we need to ensure `i` remains less than `n` for the next iteration.
   - However, since `i` is directly dependent on `start` and `start` itself is unchanged from its original value (which is the same as the original `i`), the critical adjustment is to maintain `i` such that it remains less than `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is less than `n` for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `start + 1`, `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing the substring `word[start:i]` if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `i` must be less than `n`**.
