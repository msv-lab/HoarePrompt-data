Let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop starts with `i` being the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. The loop increments `i` as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

### Track Variable Changes
- `word`: The input string remains unchanged.
- `i`: This variable is incremented until it reaches the next index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` or until `i` equals `n`.
- `start`: This variable is the initial value of `i` when the loop starts and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `result`: This list accumulates substrings `word[start:i]` based on certain conditions. It starts empty and gets populated during each iteration of the loop.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. Once the condition `func_1(word[i])` becomes `False` or `i` reaches `n`, the loop terminates. During each iteration, the substring `word[start:i]` is added to `result` if it meets one of the specified conditions.

### Verify Relationships
From the provided output states, we can infer the following:
- After the loop executes 1 time, `i` is `start + 1`.
- After the loop executes 2 times, `i` is `start + 3`.
- After the loop executes 3 times, `i` is `start + 4`.

This pattern suggests that after \( k \) iterations, `i` is `start + (k+1)`.

### Determine Final Output State
If the loop executes until it cannot find any more indices where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, then the final value of `i` will be the first index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` or `i` equals `n`. In this case, `i` will be `start + (number of times the loop executed + 1)`.

Thus, the final state of the variables will be:
- `word`: Remains unchanged.
- `i`: The smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `False` or `i` equals `n`.
- `start`: Remains the initial value of `i`.
- `result`: Contains all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list.

### Final Output State
Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `False` or `i` equals `n`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list.
