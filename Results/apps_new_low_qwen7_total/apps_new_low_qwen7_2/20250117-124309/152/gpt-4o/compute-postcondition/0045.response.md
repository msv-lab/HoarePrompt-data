Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `start < i`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the largest index \( j \) such that `func_1(word[j])` returns True and \( j < n \).
   - `start` is \( i \).
   - `result` is a list containing all characters from \( \text{start}-1 \) to \( i-1 \) (inclusive) plus the substring `word[start-1:start+2]` if \( i - \text{start} + 1 \geq 5 \) and `func_2(word[start-1:i])` returns True; otherwise, `result` contains the previous elements plus the substring `word[start-1:i]`.
   - `n` is greater than \( i + 1 \).

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `start` and the value of `i`.
   - For the loop to continue, `start` must be less than `i`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `start` is already equal to `i` at the end of the previous iteration, to allow the loop to continue, `start` must be incremented to a value less than `i`.
   - `i` remains unchanged because the problem specifies that `i` is the largest index \( j \) such that `func_1(word[j])` returns True and \( j < n \). Changing `i` would alter the value of `i` itself rather than allowing the loop to continue.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `start`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index \( j \) such that `func_1(word[j])` returns True and \( j < n \), `start` is \( i + 1 \), `result` is a list containing all characters from \( \text{start}-1 \) to \( i-1 \) (inclusive) plus the substring `word[start-1:start+2]` if \( i - \text{start} + 1 \geq 5 \) and `func_2(word[start-1:i])` returns True; otherwise, `result` contains the previous elements plus the substring `word[start-1:i]`, `n` is greater than \( i + 1 \)**
