Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` and `k < n`, `start` is equal to the original `i`, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` must be greater than `i`.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop increments `i` as long as `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. This means `i` will be set to the largest index where `func_1(word[i])` is `True` and `i < n`.
2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i`: Starts from the smallest index `j` where `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`. It is incremented until it no longer satisfies the condition `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
   - `start`: Remains constant and is equal to the original value of `i` at the start of the loop.
   - `result`: Initially contains all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise it contains the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`. This list is updated based on the conditions inside the loop but remains invariant with respect to the changes in `i`.
   - `word`: The input string remains unchanged.
   - `n`: The length of the string `word`, which remains constant.
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop continues to increment `i` until either `i` reaches `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`. At this point, `i` will be the largest index where `func_1(word[i])` is `True` and `i < n`.
4. **Verify Relationships**: After the loop, `i` will be the largest index where `func_1(word[i])` is `True` and `i < n`, `start` will still be the original `i`, and `result` will be constructed based on the conditions specified, ensuring consistency with the described iterations and final output state.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations is as described above.
