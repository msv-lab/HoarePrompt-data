The code `start = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `start`. This means that the value of `start` is now the same as the value of `i`, which was previously the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`. The other variables (`word`, `result`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n`, `start` is equal to `i`, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
