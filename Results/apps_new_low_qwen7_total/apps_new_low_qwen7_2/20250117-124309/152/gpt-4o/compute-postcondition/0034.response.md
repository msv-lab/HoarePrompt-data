Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the largest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` and `j < n` plus 1.
   - `start` is equal to the previous `i`.
   - `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
   - `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
   - `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

3. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.
   - Since `n` is already greater than `i + 1`, the only thing that needs to change is `i` such that `i` is still less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

Given the conditions, the only adjustment needed is to increment `i` such that `i` is still less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

**Step-by-step adjustment**:
- Increment `i` by 1.
- Check if `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`, `start` is equal to the new `i`, `result` is updated based on the new `i` value, and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False**.
