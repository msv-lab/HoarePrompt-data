Output State: **word is a non-empty string, i is the largest index j such that func_1(word[j]) returns True and j < n, start is equal to the original i before any incrementation, result is a list containing all characters from start to i-1 (inclusive) plus the substring 'word[start:start+2]' if i - start >= 5 and func_2(word[start:i]) returns True, otherwise result is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring word[start:i], and n is greater than i + 1**.

Explanation:
- The first line appends the substring `word[start:start + 2]` to the list `result`. This means the last two characters from the substring `word[start:i]` are added to `result`.
- The second line increments `start` by 2. 

Given that `i - start` was initially at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, the condition `i - start >= 5` is now checked. Since we are adding 2 more characters to `result`, the length of the substring being considered for `func_2` increases by 2, thus ensuring `i - start` is now at least 5. Therefore, the condition `i - start >= 5` holds true, and the new `result` will include the characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) plus the substring `word[start:start+2]`.

Note: The exact values of `word`, `i`, `start`, and `n` are not specified, so they remain as described in the precondition.
