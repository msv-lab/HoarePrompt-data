`i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was originally `start + 2` and `start` is the original value of `i` before incrementation, the new value of `i` is now `(start + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `start + 3`. The function call `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, and the condition that `i` must be less than `n` remains valid. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `start + 3`, `start` is equal to the original `i` before incrementation, `result` is updated based on the new `i` value, and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` and `i` must be less than `n`**
