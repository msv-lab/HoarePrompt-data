Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next index in `word` where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and no further characters satisfy this condition (or `n` if no such index exists), `start` is the initial value of `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list, and `n` is the length of `word`.

- **Variables that remain constant throughout the loop:**
  - `n` (the length of `word`).

- **Final values of all variables after the loop finishes:**
  - `word`: The input string.
  - `i`: The next index in `word` where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and no further characters satisfy this condition (or `n` if no such index exists).
  - `start`: The initial value of `i` before any incrementation.
  - `result`: A list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list.

- **Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute:**
  - The outer `while` loop continues as long as `i < n`. Once `i` reaches or exceeds `n`, the loop terminates. The inner `while` loops also run based on the conditions specified within them.
