Let's think through this step by step:

1. The loop condition is `start < i`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `start` is 1 and `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns True.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must be less than `i`.

Given that `start` is currently 1, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is greater than 1.

Since the loop head only involves the variables `start` and `i`, we need to ensure that `start < i` holds true for the next iteration. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is greater than 1.

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns True and `i` must be greater than 1, `start` is 1, `result` is ['e']**
