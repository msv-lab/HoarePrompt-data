To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head:

```
while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
```

The loop condition consists of two parts:
1. `i < n`
2. `(not func_1(word[i]))`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `word` is a non-empty string
- `i` is `original_i + 3`
- `n` is greater than or equal to `original_i + 2`
- `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true at the start of the next iteration.

1. **Condition `i < n`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `original_i + 3`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `original_i + 2`.
   - For `i < n` to hold true in the next iteration, `i` must still be less than `n`.

2. **Condition `(not func_1(word[i]))`:**
   - The function `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming `i += 1` in the loop body), so `i` will become `original_i + 4`.
   - Therefore, `func_1(word[original_i + 4])` must return `False` for the loop to continue.

Given these conditions, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` must be such that `i < n` holds true.
- `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` for `i = original_i + 4`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` must be `original_i + 4` (since `i` is incremented by 1).
- `func_1(word[original_i + 4])` must return `False`.

The final state after adjusting for the next iteration is:

State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `original_i + 4`, `n` is greater than or equal to `original_i + 2`, and `func_1(word[original_i + 4])` must return `False`**
