Output State: `word` is a non-empty string, `i` equals `start + 1`, `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop increments `i` as long as `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. This means the loop will stop as soon as `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` or when `i` reaches `n`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` starts at its initial value `i` and gets incremented each time through the loop until either `i` equals `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
   - `start` remains unchanged because it is only assigned the initial value of `i` before the loop starts and does not get modified inside the loop.
   - `result` is constructed based on the conditions given, and it depends on the values of `start`, `i`, and `func_2(word[start:i])`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After the loop, `i` will be one more than the last index where `func_1(word[i])` returned `True`, or it will be equal to `n` if no such index exists.
   - Since `i` becomes `start + 1`, the range `start` to `i-1` (which is `start` to `start`) contains just the character at index `start`.
   - If `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, then `result` will contain all characters from `start` to `i-1`. Otherwise, `result` will contain the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationship between `i`, `start`, and `n` is consistent with the loop behavior.
   - The final value of `i` being `start + 1` confirms that the loop has stopped executing when `i` reaches `start + 1`.

Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is as described above.
