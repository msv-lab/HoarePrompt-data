To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions required:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n and func_1(word[i])`.
   - This means for the loop to execute, two conditions must be met:
     1. `i` must be less than `n`.
     2. `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`.
   - `start` is equal to `i`.
   - `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.

3. **Ensuring the First Condition (`i < n`) is Met**:
   - Since `i` is defined as the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, we need to ensure that there exists at least one index `j` where `func_1(word[j])` returns `True` but `j < n`.

4. **Ensuring the Second Condition (`func_1(word[i])` returns `True`) is Met**:
   - To ensure `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` when `i` is evaluated, `i` must be the smallest index where this condition holds.

Given the current states, `i` being the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n` implies that `i` cannot be `n` initially because the loop condition also requires `i < n`. Therefore, `i` must be the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

### Conclusion:
- `i` must be the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` and `i < n`, `start` is equal to `i`, and `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` (inclusive) if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`**.
