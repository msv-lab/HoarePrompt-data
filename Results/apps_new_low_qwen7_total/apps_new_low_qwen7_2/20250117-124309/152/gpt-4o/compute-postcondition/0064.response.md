`i` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `i` is originally `original_i + 2`, so after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` becomes `original_i + 3`. The precondition that `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` remains unchanged, and the values of `word`, `n`, and `original_i` are not affected.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `original_i + 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to `original_i + 2`, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`**
