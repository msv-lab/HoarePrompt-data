The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was originally set to `start + 2`. After executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` will be `(start + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `start + 3`. The other variables (`word`, `start`, `result`, and the functions `func_1` and `func_2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is `start + 3`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.**
