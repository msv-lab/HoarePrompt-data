Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and func_1(word[i])`.
2. **Analyze Each Variable in the Loop Condition**:
   - `i`: This is the index being checked within the string `word`.
   - `n`: This is some upper limit for the index `i`.
   - `func_1(word[i])`: This function must return `True` for the loop to continue.

3. **Initial States Before the Loop**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
   - `start` is the initial value of `i`.
   - `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, both parts of the condition `i < n and func_1(word[i])` must be satisfied.
   - Since `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, we know that `func_1(word[i])` is `True` for this `i`.
   - Therefore, the key is ensuring that `i < n`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `i < n` holds true for the first iteration of the loop.
   - Given that `i` is the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, and assuming `n` is a positive integer (since `word` is a non-empty string), `i` should be less than `n` for the loop to start.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `i` is less than `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, `start` is the initial value of `i`, and `result` is a list containing all substrings `word[start:i]` that either meet the conditions of having a length of at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`, or do not meet these conditions but are still included in the list, and `i` must be less than `n`.**
