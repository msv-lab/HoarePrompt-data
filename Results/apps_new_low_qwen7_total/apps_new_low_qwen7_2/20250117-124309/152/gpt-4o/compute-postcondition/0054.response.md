The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the largest index \( j \) such that \( func_1(word[j]) \) returns `True` and \( j < n \) plus 1.
- `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation.
- `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if \( i - start \ge 3 \) and \( func_2(word[start:i]) \) returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

After the code `i += 1` executes, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string, `i` is the largest index \( j \) such that \( func_1(word[j]) \) returns `True` and \( j < n \) plus 1 and `i` is incremented by 1, `start` is equal to the original `i` before any incrementation, `result` is a list containing all characters from `start` to `i-1` if \( i - start \ge 3 \) and \( func_2(word[start:i]) \) returns `True`, otherwise `result` is a list containing the previous elements plus the substring `word[start:i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.**
