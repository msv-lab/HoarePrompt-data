Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `line1` and `line2`, both of which are lists containing tuples representing line segments. The function calculates whether a point of intersection exists between a north-south line segment represented by `line1` and an east-west line segment represented by `line2`. The function returns `False` in two cases: when the lines do not intersect (including the case where the lines are parallel) or when the intersection point does not lie within the segments. It returns `True` if the lines intersect at a point that lies within both segments.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `line1` or `line2` is empty, the function will return `False` since no valid intersection can occur.
- The function assumes that each list contains at least one tuple; if either list is empty, the function will return `False`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where `line1` or `line2` contains more than one tuple. However, based on the provided code, it only processes the first tuple in each list. If there were multiple tuples, the function would need to iterate through them to check for intersections.
