The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `line1` and `line2`. Both `line1` and `line2` are lists of tuples. `line1` contains N tuples (A_i, B_i, C_i), where each tuple represents a north-south line segment from (A_i, C_i) to (B_i, C_i). `line2` contains M tuples (D_j, E_j, F_j), where each tuple represents an east-west line segment from (D_j, E_j) to (D_j, F_j).

Based on the output cases provided:

- Case_1: The function returns `False`.
- Case_2: The function returns `True`.
- Case_3: The function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of tuples, `line1` and `line2`, and return either `True` or `False` based on certain conditions. Specifically, it returns `False` in two cases and `True` in one case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `line1` and `line2`, both of which are lists of tuples. It returns `False` in two cases and `True` in one case based on the conditions defined within the function body.**
