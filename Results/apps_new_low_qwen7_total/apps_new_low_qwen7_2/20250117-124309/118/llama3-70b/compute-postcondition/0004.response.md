Output State: **line1 is [(x1, y1, x2)], line2 is [(x3, y3, x4)], denom is (x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4), t is ((x1 - x3) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y3) * (x3 - x4)) / denom, u is -((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y3) - (y1 - y2) * (x1 - x3)) / denom**

Explanation:
1. The first line calculates `t` using the formula provided and updates the value of `t` based on the given expressions involving `x1, y1, x2, x3, y3, x4, y4,` and `denom`.
2. The second line calculates `u` using the formula provided and updates the value of `u` based on the given expressions involving `x1, y1, x2, x3, y3, x4, y4,` and `denom`.

Both `t` and `u` are calculated and stored in their respective variables, while `line1`, `line2`, and `denom` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
