Postcondition: **`line1` is [(x1, y1, x2)], `line2` is [(x3, y3, x4)], `denom` is (x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4), `t` is ((x1 - x3) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y3) * (x3 - x4)) / denom, `u` is -((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y3) - (y1 - y2) * (x1 - x3)) / denom, and the current values of `t` and `u` satisfy 0 <= t <= 1 and 0 <= u <= 1**
