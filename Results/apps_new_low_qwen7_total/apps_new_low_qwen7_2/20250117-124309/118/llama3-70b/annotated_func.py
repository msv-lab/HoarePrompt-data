#State of the program right berfore the function call: line1 and line2 are lists of tuples. line1 contains N tuples (A_i, B_i, C_i) representing north-south lines, and line2 contains M tuples (D_j, E_j, F_j) representing east-west lines. Each tuple (A_i, B_i, C_i) represents a north-south line segment from (A_i, C_i) to (B_i, C_i), and each tuple (D_j, E_j, F_j) represents an east-west line segment from (D_j, E_j) to (D_j, F_j).

    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `line1` and `line2`, both of which are lists containing tuples representing line segments. The function calculates whether a point of intersection exists between a north-south line segment represented by `line1` and an east-west line segment represented by `line2`. The function returns `False` in two cases: when the lines do not intersect (including the case where the lines are parallel) or when the intersection point does not lie within the segments. It returns `True` if the lines intersect at a point that lies within both segments.
