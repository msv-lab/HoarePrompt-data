Precondition: **line1 and line2 are lists of tuples. line1 contains N tuples (A_i, B_i, C_i) representing north-south lines, and line2 contains M tuples (D_j, E_j, F_j) representing east-west lines. Each tuple (A_i, B_i, C_i) represents a north-south line segment from (A_i, C_i) to (B_i, C_i), and each tuple (D_j, E_j, F_j) represents an east-west line segment from (D_j, E_j) to (D_j, F_j).**
