### Reasoning:

1. **Sorting Lines**: The program sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their y-coordinates and x-coordinates respectively. This ensures that the lines are processed in a consistent order.

2. **Finding Intersection Points**: The program identifies unique intersection points by iterating over all pairs of north-south and east-west lines and checking for intersections using the `func_1` function. This ensures that the program correctly accounts for all possible intersection points.

3. **Intersection Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the denominator of the determinant used to find the intersection point.
   - If the denominator is zero, the lines are parallel and do not intersect, so the function returns `False`.
   - If the denominator is non-zero, the function calculates the parameter values `t` and `u` which represent the position of the intersection point along the respective line segments.
   - If `t` and `u` are both between 0 and 1, the intersection point lies within both segments, and the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

4. **Area Calculation**: After identifying all unique x and y points, the program calculates the area of the convex polygon formed by these points. The area is calculated using the shoelace formula, which iterates over pairs of consecutive points to compute the area.

5. **Handling Infinite Area**: If no valid intersection points are found, the area is zero, and the program prints "INF".

### Analysis:
- The sorting logic is correct and ensures that all lines are processed in a consistent manner.
- The intersection function `func_1` correctly determines if two line segments intersect and checks if the intersection point lies within both segments.
- The area calculation uses the correct method (shoelace formula) to compute the area of the polygon formed by the intersection points.

Given the provided code and the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
