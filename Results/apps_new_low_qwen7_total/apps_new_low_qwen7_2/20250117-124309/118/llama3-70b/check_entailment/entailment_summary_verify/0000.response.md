Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the provided function summary to validate or challenge the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling and Sorting**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their \( y \)-coordinates (for north-south lines) and \( x \)-coordinates (for east-west lines).

2. **Identifying Unique Points**:
   - The program identifies unique \( x \)-coordinates and \( y \)-coordinates from the sorted segments. This step is crucial for determining the boundaries of the reachable area.

3. **Checking for Intersections**:
   - The `func_1` function checks for intersections between north-south and east-west lines. The logic in `func_1` is correct in terms of calculating the intersection point using the determinant method. However, the assessment claims that the function might not correctly handle the endpoints of the segments. 

   To verify this claim, let's consider the provided example:
   
   ```
   1 1
   1 2 0
   0 1 1
   ```

   - The north-south line is from (1, 0) to (2, 0).
   - The east-west line is from (0, 1) to (0, 1).

   - According to `func_1`, the function correctly identifies that the lines do not intersect because the intersection point (0, 1) is not within the segment (1, 0) to (2, 0) for the north-south line and is not on the endpoint of the east-west line. Thus, the function returns `False`.

4. **Calculating the Reachable Area**:
   - After identifying the unique \( x \)-coordinates and \( y \)-coordinates, the program calculates the area between consecutive points. The area calculation is correct if the segments are handled properly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the area is infinite by checking if the calculated area is zero. If the area is zero, it prints 'INF'.

Given the above analysis, the program does correctly identify and handle the segments, including their endpoints, through the use of the `func_1` function. The original assessment's claim that the program does not correctly handle the endpoints is inaccurate.

Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided function summary.
