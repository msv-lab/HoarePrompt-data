You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a grass field that stretches infinitely.
In this field, there is a negligibly small cow. Let (x, y) denote the point that is x\ \mathrm{cm} south and y\ \mathrm{cm} east of the point where the cow stands now. The cow itself is standing at (0, 0).
There are also N north-south lines and M east-west lines drawn on the field. The i-th north-south line is the segment connecting the points (A_i, C_i) and (B_i, C_i), and the j-th east-west line is the segment connecting the points (D_j, E_j) and (D_j, F_j).
What is the area of the region the cow can reach when it can move around as long as it does not cross the segments (including the endpoints)? If this area is infinite, print INF instead.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers between -10^9 and 10^9  (inclusive).
 - 1 \leq N, M \leq 1000
 - A_i < B_i\ (1 \leq i \leq N)
 - E_j < F_j\ (1 \leq j \leq M)
 - The point (0, 0) does not lie on any of the given segments.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 B_1 C_1
:
A_N B_N C_N
D_1 E_1 F_1
:
D_M E_M F_M

-----Output-----
If the area of the region the cow can reach is infinite, print INF; otherwise, print an integer representing the area in \mathrm{cm^2}.
(Under the constraints, it can be proved that the area of the region is always an integer if it is not infinite.)

-----Sample Input-----
5 6
1 2 0
0 1 1
0 2 2
-3 4 -1
-2 6 3
1 0 1
0 1 2
2 0 2
-1 -4 5
3 -2 4
1 2 4

-----Sample Output-----
13

The area of the region the cow can reach is 13\ \mathrm{cm^2}.

```

y_points = sorted(list(y_points))
area = 0
for i in range(len(x_points) - 1):
    for j in range(len(y_points) - 1):
        area += (x_points[i + 1] - x_points[i]) * (y_points[j + 1] - y_points[j])
if area == 0:
    print('INF')
else:
    print(area)

def func_1(line1, line2):
    (x1, y1, x2) = line1
    (x3, y3, x4) = line2
    denom = (x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4)
    if denom == 0:
        return False
    t = ((x1 - x3) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y3) * (x3 - x4)) / denom
    u = -((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y3) - (y1 - y2) * (x1 - x3)) / denom
    if 0 <= t <= 1 and 0 <= u <= 1:
        return True
    return False

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
