Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the segments' endpoints and their impact on the reachable area. The function `func_1` is intended to check if a north-south line and an east-west line intersect, but its implementation is flawed. It calculates the intersection point using a linear interpolation formula, which may not correctly determine if the intersection point lies on the segment's endpoints.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1 1
1 2 0
0 1 1
```

In this case, there is a north-south line from (1, 0) to (2, 0) and an east-west line from (0, 1) to (0, 1). The cow should be able to move freely in the entire plane except for the area covered by these two segments. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the area as finite because it does not correctly handle the endpoints of the segments.

The correct approach would involve checking if the endpoints of the segments lie within the range of other segments and adjusting the reachable area accordingly.
