Reasoning:

1. **Sorting Lines**: The program correctly sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their y-coordinates and x-coordinates respectively. This is necessary to later determine the intersection points and boundary lines.

2. **Collecting Boundary Points**: The program collects all unique x and y coordinates from the lines. This step ensures that we have the boundary points that define the reachable area for the cow.

3. **Checking Intersections**: The function `func_1` checks if two line segments intersect. It correctly calculates the denominator and uses it to compute the parameters \(t\) and \(u\) which indicate the relative positions of the intersection point along the two line segments. The function correctly returns `True` if the intersection point lies within both line segments and `False` otherwise.

4. **Area Calculation**: After collecting all unique boundary points, the program calculates the area using the trapezoidal rule. The nested loops iterate over all possible pairs of consecutive x and y points to calculate the area of the resulting polygons. If the area is zero, it indicates that the lines completely block the area, and the program prints 'INF'. Otherwise, it prints the calculated area.

Given that the logic in the sorting, intersection checking, and area calculation steps appear to be sound and match the problem requirements, the provided program should work correctly under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
