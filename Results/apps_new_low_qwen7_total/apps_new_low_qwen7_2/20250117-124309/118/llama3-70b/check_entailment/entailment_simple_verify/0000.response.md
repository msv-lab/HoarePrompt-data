### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

#### Key Points to Evaluate:
1. **Sorting Lines**: The program sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their y-coordinates and x-coordinates respectively.
2. **Intersection Check**: The function `func_1` checks if a north-south line and an east-west line intersect.
3. **Reachable Area Calculation**: The program computes the area by considering the intervals formed by the unique x and y coordinates from the lines.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sorting**:
   - North-south lines are sorted based on their y-coordinates (`north_south_lines.sort(key=cmp_to_key(lambda x, y: x - y))`).
   - East-west lines are sorted based on their x-coordinates (`east_west_lines.sort(key=cmp_to_key(lambda x, y: x - y))`).

2. **Finding Unique X and Y Points**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted lines to find unique x and y points where the lines intersect. This is done to determine the boundaries of the reachable area.

3. **Intersection Check (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to determine if a north-south line and an east-west line intersect. However, the implementation of `func_1` has several issues:
     - It uses the determinant method to find the intersection point, but it does not check if the intersection point lies within the segment's bounds.
     - The method does not handle cases where the segments are vertical or horizontal lines (i.e., lines with undefined slopes).

4. **Area Calculation**:
   - After identifying the unique x and y points, the program calculates the area by summing up the areas of rectangles formed by these points.
   - If no valid rectangles are found (i.e., the area is zero), the program prints 'INF'.

#### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Intersection Check**: The function `func_1` does not correctly determine if the intersection point lies on the segment's endpoints. This means it might incorrectly identify non-intersecting segments as intersecting.
- **Handling Vertical and Horizontal Lines**: The current implementation does not handle vertical and horizontal lines properly, which could lead to incorrect area calculations.

#### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the following input:
```
1 1
1 2 0
0 1 1
```
- There is a north-south line from (1, 0) to (2, 0).
- There is an east-west line from (0, 1) to (0, 1).

The program should recognize that the cow cannot move in the entire plane except for the area covered by these two segments. However, the current implementation might incorrectly calculate the area as finite due to the flawed intersection check.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically, the intersection check is flawed, leading to incorrect area calculations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
