You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grass field that stretches infinitely.
In this field, there is a negligibly small cow. Let (x, y) denote the point that is x\ \mathrm{cm} south and y\ \mathrm{cm} east of the point where the cow stands now. The cow itself is standing at (0, 0).
There are also N north-south lines and M east-west lines drawn on the field. The i-th north-south line is the segment connecting the points (A_i, C_i) and (B_i, C_i), and the j-th east-west line is the segment connecting the points (D_j, E_j) and (D_j, F_j).
What is the area of the region the cow can reach when it can move around as long as it does not cross the segments (including the endpoints)? If this area is infinite, print INF instead.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers between -10^9 and 10^9  (inclusive).
 - 1 \leq N, M \leq 1000
 - A_i < B_i\ (1 \leq i \leq N)
 - E_j < F_j\ (1 \leq j \leq M)
 - The point (0, 0) does not lie on any of the given segments.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 B_1 C_1
:
A_N B_N C_N
D_1 E_1 F_1
:
D_M E_M F_M

-----Output-----
If the area of the region the cow can reach is infinite, print INF; otherwise, print an integer representing the area in \mathrm{cm^2}.
(Under the constraints, it can be proved that the area of the region is always an integer if it is not infinite.)

-----Sample Input-----
5 6
1 2 0
0 1 1
0 2 2
-3 4 -1
-2 6 3
1 0 1
0 1 2
2 0 2
-1 -4 5
3 -2 4
1 2 4

-----Sample Output-----
13

The area of the region the cow can reach is 13\ \mathrm{cm^2}.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the segments' endpoints and their impact on the reachable area. The function `func_1` is intended to check if a north-south line and an east-west line intersect, but its implementation is flawed. It calculates the intersection point using a linear interpolation formula, which may not correctly determine if the intersection point lies on the segment's endpoints.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1 1
1 2 0
0 1 1
```

In this case, there is a north-south line from (1, 0) to (2, 0) and an east-west line from (0, 1) to (0, 1). The cow should be able to move freely in the entire plane except for the area covered by these two segments. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the area as finite because it does not correctly handle the endpoints of the segments.

The correct approach would involve checking if the endpoints of the segments lie within the range of other segments and adjusting the reachable area accordingly.
