Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the logic step-by-step and check each part against the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of north-south lines (`N`) and east-west lines (`M`).
   - It then reads the coordinates of these lines and stores them in appropriate lists (`north_south_lines` and `east_west_lines`).

2. **Sorting Lines**:
   - The lines are sorted based on their y-coordinates (for north-south lines) and x-coordinates (for east-west lines). This ensures that the lines are processed in a consistent order.

3. **Collecting Unique Points**:
   - The program collects unique x and y points from the lines, ensuring no duplicates.
   - This step is crucial as it helps in determining the boundaries of the reachable area.

4. **Checking for Intersections**:
   - The program checks for intersections between north-south and east-west lines using the `func_1` function.
   - If an intersection is found, the x and y points are added to the respective sets. This step ensures that the boundary points of the reachable area are correctly identified.

5. **Sorting Points**:
   - The collected x and y points are sorted to form the boundaries of the reachable area.

6. **Calculating Area**:
   - The program uses the shoelace formula to calculate the area enclosed by the sorted points.
   - If the area is zero, it prints 'INF' indicating the area is infinite.
   - Otherwise, it prints the calculated area.

7. **Intersection Function** (`func_1`):
   - The `func_1` function correctly determines if a line segment intersects with another line segment.
   - It handles cases where the lines are parallel or do not intersect within the segments.
   - The logic for calculating the intersection point and checking if it lies within both segments is sound.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described. There are no obvious logical errors or discrepancies with the provided constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
