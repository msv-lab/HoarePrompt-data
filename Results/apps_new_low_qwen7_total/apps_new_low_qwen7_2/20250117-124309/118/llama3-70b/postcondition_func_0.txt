The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `line1` and `line2`, both of which are lists containing tuples representing line segments. The function calculates whether a point of intersection exists between a north-south line segment represented by `line1` and an east-west line segment represented by `line2`. The function returns `False` in two cases: when the lines do not intersect (including the case where the lines are parallel) or when the intersection point does not lie within the segments. It returns `True` if the lines intersect at a point that lies within both segments.
