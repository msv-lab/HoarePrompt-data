The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the constraint that the variable `n` (though not passed as a parameter) is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), representing the number of players in the tournament.

However, since no specific output or logic is provided for the function body, we cannot determine what exact value or type of value the function returns without additional information. Given the constraints alone, the function could potentially return various types of values depending on the intended purpose, but based solely on the provided information:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on the constraint that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), where \(n\) represents the number of players in the tournament.**
