Initial State: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^18

Code Execution:
1. `n = int(input())`: This line takes an integer input and assigns it to `n`. The value of `n` remains the same as the input.
2. `max_games = n.bit_length() - 1`: This line calculates the bit length of `n` using the `bit_length()` method, which returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. Then, it subtracts 1 from this value to get the maximum number of games needed in a single-elimination tournament (where each game eliminates one player). This value is assigned to `max_games`.
3. `print(max_games)`: This line prints the value of `max_games`.

Final Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^18, max_games is the result of n.bit_length() - 1**
