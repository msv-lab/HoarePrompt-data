Functionality: **The function calculates the maximum number of games that can be played in a single-elimination tournament given the number of players \(n\), where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). The function reads the value of \(n\) from the user, computes the maximum number of games using the bit length of \(n\) minus one, and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has printed the calculated maximum number of games.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(n = 2\), the maximum number of games is 1, which is correctly computed as \(2\) (bit length of 2) minus 1.
- If \(n\) is exactly \(10^{18}\), the maximum number of games is 64, which is correctly computed as \(63\) (bit length of \(10^{18}\)).

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle invalid inputs. For example, if the input is not an integer or if the input is outside the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the function does not provide any error handling.
