### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can play under the given constraints.
   - The key constraint is that two players can only play against each other if the difference in the number of games they have played is at most 1.
   - The tournament follows a knockout format, meaning each game eliminates one player.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The provided solution uses `n.bit_length() - 1` to compute the result.
   - `n.bit_length()` returns the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary form, which is equivalent to `log2(n)` rounded up.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - Let's consider the binary representation of `n`. If `n` is a power of 2 (e.g., 4, 8, 16), the winner can play in all games because each round halves the number of players.
   - For numbers that are not powers of 2, the maximum number of games the winner can play is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
   - The expression `n.bit_length() - 1` gives us the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` when interpreted correctly.

4. **Examples Verification:**
   - For `n = 2`, the highest power of 2 is 2, so `bit_length - 1 = 1`.
   - For `n = 3`, the highest power of 2 is 2, so `bit_length - 1 = 1`.
   - For `n = 4`, the highest power of 2 is 4, so `bit_length - 1 = 2`.
   - For `n = 10`, the highest power of 2 is 8, so `bit_length - 1 = 3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases where `n` is a power of 2 perfectly.
   - It also correctly handles non-power-of-2 cases by finding the largest power of 2 less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is correct. It correctly computes the maximum number of games the winner can play using the `bit_length` method, which is an efficient way to determine the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

**Correctness: **True**
