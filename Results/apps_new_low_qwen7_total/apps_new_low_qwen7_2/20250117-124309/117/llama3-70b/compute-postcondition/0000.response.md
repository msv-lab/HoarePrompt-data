Output State: **l1 is max(l1, l2), r1 is unchanged, l2 is unchanged, r2 is unchanged, k is unchanged, start is max(l1, l2), end is min(r1, r2)**

Explanation:
The code reads five space-separated non-negative integers from input and assigns them to the variables `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, and `k` respectively. It then calculates two new variables: `start` which is the maximum of `l1` and `l2`, and `end` which is the minimum of `r1` and `r2`.

Since the initial values of `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, and `k` are non-negative integers within the specified range, the output state reflects the updated values of `start` and `end`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their input values.
