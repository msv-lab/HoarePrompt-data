Postcondition: ***`l1` is the maximum of `l1` and `l2`, `r1` is unchanged, `l2` is unchanged, `r2` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `start` is the maximum of `l1` and `l2`, `end` is the minimum of `r1` and `r2` - 1, and if `start` <= `k` <= `end`, then the condition holds; otherwise, the condition does not change.***
