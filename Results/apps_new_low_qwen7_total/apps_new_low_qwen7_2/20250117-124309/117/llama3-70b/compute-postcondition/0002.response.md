The value of `end` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, `k`, `start`) remain unchanged. The initial value of `end` was defined as `min(r1, r2)`, so after decrementing `end` by 1, the new value of `end` is `min(r1, r2) - 1`.

Output State: **`l1` is max(`l1`, `l2`), `r1` is unchanged, `l2` is unchanged, `r2` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `start` is max(`l1`, `l2`), `end` is min(`r1`, `r2`) - 1 and the current value of `k` satisfies start <= k <= min(`r1`, `r2`) - 1**
