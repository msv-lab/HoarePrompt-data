You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Today an outstanding event is going to happen in the forest — hedgehog Filya will come to his old fried Sonya!

Sonya is an owl and she sleeps during the day and stay awake from minute l_1 to minute r_1 inclusive. Also, during the minute k she prinks and is unavailable for Filya.

Filya works a lot and he plans to visit Sonya from minute l_2 to minute r_2 inclusive.

Calculate the number of minutes they will be able to spend together.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integers l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 and k (1 ≤ l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, k ≤ 10^18, l_1 ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ r_2), providing the segments of time for Sonya and Filya and the moment of time when Sonya prinks.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of minutes Sonya and Filya will be able to spend together.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 10 9 20 1

Output
2

Input
1 100 50 200 75

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first sample, they will be together during minutes 9 and 10.

In the second sample, they will be together from minute 50 to minute 74 and from minute 76 to minute 100.

- Program:
def func():
    (l1, r1, l2, r2, k) = map(int, input().split())
    start = max(l1, l2)
    end = min(r1, r2)
    if start <= k <= end:
        end -= 1
    minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)
    print(minutes_together)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts five non-negative integer parameters \( l_1 \), \( r_1 \), \( l_2 \), \( r_2 \), and \( k \). It first determines the maximum of \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) and assigns it to the variable `start`, and the minimum of \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) and assigns it to the variable `end`. If \( k \) falls within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive), it subtracts 1 from `end`. Finally, it calculates the number of overlapping minutes between the intervals \([ \max(l_1, l_2), \min(r_1, r_2) - 1 ]\) and \([ \max(l_1, l_2), \min(r_1, r_2) - 1 ]\) and returns this value. If no overlap exists, it returns 0. Potential edge cases include when \( l_1 > r_1 \) or \( l_2 > r_2 \), in which case the function will set `start` and `end` to invalid values, leading to a non-overlapping interval and a return value of 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of minutes Filya and Sonya can spend together. Here's why:

1. It reads the input values for `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, and `k`.
2. It determines the overlapping time segment between their availability using `max(l1, l2)` and `min(r1, r2)`.
3. It checks if the prinking minute `k` falls within this overlapping segment. If it does, it adjusts the end time by subtracting 1 to exclude that minute.
4. Finally, it calculates the number of minutes they can spend together using `max(0, end - start + 1)` and prints the result.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly without missing any edge scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.
