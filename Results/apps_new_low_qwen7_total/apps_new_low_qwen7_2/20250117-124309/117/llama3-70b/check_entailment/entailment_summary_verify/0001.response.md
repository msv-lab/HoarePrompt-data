### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the five integers \( l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, \) and \( k \) from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Calculating Start and End Times**:
   - The program correctly sets `start` to the maximum of \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \).
   - The program correctly sets `end` to the minimum of \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \).

3. **Handling Prinking Minute**:
   - The condition `if start <= k <= end` checks if Sonya is available (not prinking) during the overlap period.
   - If this condition is true, the program correctly subtracts 1 from `end` to exclude the minute when Sonya is prinking.

4. **Calculating Overlap Duration**:
   - The final calculation `max(0, end - start + 1)` ensures that the result is non-negative and correctly computes the number of overlapping minutes.

### Edge Cases:
- The original assessment did not consider edge cases where the intervals do not overlap. However, the program handles these cases correctly by setting `start` and `end` appropriately. If there is no overlap, `end - start` will be negative, and `max(0, end - start + 1)` will return 0.

### Verification with Examples:
- For the example input `1 10 9 20 1`, the program calculates:
  - `start = max(1, 9) = 9`
  - `end = min(10, 20) = 10`
  - Since `9 <= 1 <= 10` is false, no subtraction occurs, and the result is `10 - 9 + 1 = 2`.
- For the example input `1 100 50 200 75`, the program calculates:
  - `start = max(1, 50) = 50`
  - `end = min(100, 200) = 100`
  - Since `50 <= 75 <= 100` is true, `end` is adjusted to `99`.
  - The result is `max(0, 99 - 50 + 1) = 50`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of minutes Sonya and Filya can spend together. The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior.

**Final: True**
