You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Today an outstanding event is going to happen in the forest — hedgehog Filya will come to his old fried Sonya!

Sonya is an owl and she sleeps during the day and stay awake from minute l_1 to minute r_1 inclusive. Also, during the minute k she prinks and is unavailable for Filya.

Filya works a lot and he plans to visit Sonya from minute l_2 to minute r_2 inclusive.

Calculate the number of minutes they will be able to spend together.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integers l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 and k (1 ≤ l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, k ≤ 10^18, l_1 ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ r_2), providing the segments of time for Sonya and Filya and the moment of time when Sonya prinks.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of minutes Sonya and Filya will be able to spend together.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 10 9 20 1

Output
2

Input
1 100 50 200 75

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first sample, they will be together during minutes 9 and 10.

In the second sample, they will be together from minute 50 to minute 74 and from minute 76 to minute 100.

- Program: 
def func():
    (l1, r1, l2, r2, k) = map(int, input().split())
    start = max(l1, l2)
    end = min(r1, r2)
    if start <= k <= end:
        end -= 1
    minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)
    print(minutes_together)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, and k are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, k ≤ 10^18, l_1 ≤ r_1, and l_2 ≤ r_2.
def func():
    l1, r1, l2, r2, k = map(int, input().split())

start = max(l1, l2)

end = min(r1, r2)
    if (start <= k <= end) :
        end -= 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l1` is the maximum of `l1` and `l2`, `r1` is unchanged, `l2` is unchanged, `r2` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `start` is the maximum of `l1` and `l2`, `end` is the minimum of `r1` and `r2` - 1, and if `start` <= `k` <= `end`, then the condition holds; otherwise, the condition does not change.
    minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)

print(minutes_together)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five non-negative integer parameters \( l_1 \), \( r_1 \), \( l_2 \), \( r_2 \), and \( k \). It first determines the maximum of \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) and assigns it to the variable `start`, and the minimum of \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) and assigns it to the variable `end`. If \( k \) falls within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive), it subtracts 1 from `end`. Finally, it calculates the number of overlapping minutes between the intervals \([ \max(l_1, l_2), \min(r_1, r_2) - 1 ]\) and \([ \max(l_1, l_2), \min(r_1, r_2) - 1 ]\) and returns this value. If no overlap exists, it returns 0. Potential edge cases include when \( l_1 > r_1 \) or \( l_2 > r_2 \), in which case the function will set `start` and `end` to invalid values, leading to a non-overlapping interval and a return value of 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the five integers \( l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, \) and \( k \) from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.
2. It then calculates the overlap period by determining the maximum of \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) as the start time and the minimum of \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) as the end time.
3. The condition `if start <= k <= end` checks if Sonya is available (not prinking) during the overlap period.
4. If this condition is true, it subtracts one from the end time to exclude the minute when Sonya is prinking.
5. Finally, it calculates the number of minutes they can spend together using `max(0, end - start + 1)` to ensure that the result is non-negative and prints it.

Given the logic, the program correctly implements the solution to find the number of minutes Sonya and Filya can spend together.
