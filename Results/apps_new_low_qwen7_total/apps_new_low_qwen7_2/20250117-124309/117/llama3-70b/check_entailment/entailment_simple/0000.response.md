### Reasoning:

1. **Initial State Validation**: The input values \( l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, \) and \( k \) are correctly read from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Start and End Calculation**:
   - The variable `start` is set to the maximum of \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \).
   - The variable `end` is set to the minimum of \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \). 
   
3. **Prinking Time Check**:
   - If \( k \) falls within the interval \([start, end]\), it means Sonya is prinking during that time. Hence, the actual end time is adjusted by decrementing it by 1 to exclude the prinking time.

4. **Calculation of Together Time**:
   - The number of minutes they can spend together is calculated as `max(0, end - start + 1)`. This ensures that the result is zero if the start time is greater than the end time, indicating no overlapping time.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, the output should be 0, which is correctly handled by the `max(0, ...)` function.
   - If `k` is outside the interval \([start, end]\), the program still correctly calculates the time without adjusting the end time.

Given that all conditions and edge cases are handled correctly, the provided solution is accurate and follows the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
