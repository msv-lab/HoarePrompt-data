### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the minimum value of \( k \). This is a good approach because it efficiently narrows down the possible values of \( k \).

2. **Binary Search Condition**: The condition inside the binary search loop checks if Vasya can eat at least half of the candies (`can_vasya_eat_half(k)`). If true, it moves the right boundary to the middle (`right = mid`); otherwise, it moves the left boundary to one position right of the middle (`left = mid + 1`).

3. **Eating Calculation Function**: The function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` correctly simulates the process of eating candies. It alternates between Vasya and Petya, reducing the total by \( k \) for Vasya and by \( 10\% \) (rounded down) for Petya.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When there are fewer than \( k \) candies, Vasya eats all of them.
   - When there are fewer than 10 candies left, Petya doesnâ€™t eat anything.

5. **Final Check**: The function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` returns `True` if Vasya has eaten at least half of the candies, which is correctly implemented.

However, there is a critical flaw in the `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` function. Specifically, when Petya eats, the remaining candies are reduced by \( \left\lfloor \frac{\text{total}}{10} \right\rfloor \). This rounding down can lead to underestimation of the total candies eaten by Vasya, especially when the number of candies is small. 

For example, consider the input `n = 68`:
- If \( k = 3 \):
  - Day 1: Vasya eats 3, total = 65, Petya eats 6, total = 59
  - Day 2: Vasya eats 3, total = 56, Petya eats 5, total = 51
  - Day 3: Vasya eats 3, total = 48, Petya eats 4, total = 44
  - Day 4: Vasya eats 3, total = 41, Petya eats 4, total = 37
  - Day 5: Vasya eats 3, total = 34, Petya eats 3, total = 31
  - Day 6: Vasya eats 3, total = 28, Petya eats 2, total = 26
  - Day 7: Vasya eats 3, total = 23, Petya eats 2, total = 21
  - Day 8: Vasya eats 3, total = 18, Petya eats 1, total = 17
  - Day 9: Vasya eats 3, total = 14, Petya eats 1, total = 13
  - Day 10: Vasya eats 3, total = 10, Petya eats 1, total = 9
  - Day 11: Vasya eats 3, total = 6, Petya eats 0, total = 6
  - Day 12: Vasya eats 3, total = 3, Petya eats 0, total = 3
  - Day 13: Vasya eats 3, total = 0, Petya eats 0, total = 0

  Vasya eats 39 candies, and Petya eats 29 candies. Total eaten by Vasya = 39, which is more than half of 68.

But if we simulate the exact process, we see that the function might fail to account for the exact reduction due to the rounding down. For instance, if the remaining candies are 9, Petya would eat 0, but in reality, Petya should eat 1 candy.

Therefore, the function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` might return `False` even when Vasya actually eats more than half of the candies, leading to an incorrect value of \( k \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the potential underestimation in the `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` function.
