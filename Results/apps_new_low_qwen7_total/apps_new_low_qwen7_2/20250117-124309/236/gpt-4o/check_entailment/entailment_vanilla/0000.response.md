### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the minimum value of \( k \). This is a good approach because it efficiently narrows down the possible values of \( k \).

2. **Binary Search Condition**: The condition inside the binary search loop checks if Vasya can eat at least half of the candies (`can_vasya_eat_half(k)`). If true, it moves the right boundary to the middle (`right = mid`); otherwise, it moves the left boundary to one position right of the middle (`left = mid + 1`).

3. **Eating Calculation Function**: The function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` correctly simulates the process of eating candies. It alternates between Vasya and Petya, reducing the total by \( k \) for Vasya and by \( 10\% \) (rounded down) for Petya.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When there are fewer than \( k \) candies, Vasya eats all of them.
   - When there are fewer than 10 candies left, Petya doesnâ€™t eat anything.

5. **Final Check**: The function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` returns `True` if Vasya has eaten at least half of the candies, which is correctly implemented.

Given these points, the logic and implementation of both functions seem correct and should work as intended for the problem.
