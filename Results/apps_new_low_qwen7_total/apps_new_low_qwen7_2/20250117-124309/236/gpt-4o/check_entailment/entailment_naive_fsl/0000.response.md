Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the remaining candies after Vasya's consumption are not enough for Petya to take his share. Specifically, in the `can_vasya_eat_half` function, the logic for Petya taking 10% of the remaining candies does not account for the possibility that Petya might not take any candies if the remaining amount is less than 10. This oversight can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `n = 9`. According to the problem description:
- On the first day, Vasya eats 1 candy (since the smallest possible value of \( k \) is 1), leaving 8 candies.
- Petya eats 0 candies because 8 is not divisible by 10.

The process continues:
- On the second day, Vasya eats 1 candy, leaving 7 candies.
- Petya eats 0 candies again.

This process will repeat, and Vasya will eventually eat fewer than half of the candies. However, the program might incorrectly conclude that Vasya can eat at least half of the candies with \( k = 1 \).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that Petya's consumption is handled correctly, especially when the remaining candies are less than 10.
