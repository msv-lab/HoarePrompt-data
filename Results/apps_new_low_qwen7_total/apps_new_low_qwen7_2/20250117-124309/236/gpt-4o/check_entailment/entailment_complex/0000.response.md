Reasoning:
1. **Function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)`**: This function correctly simulates the process described in the problem. It accurately calculates the total number of candies Vasya eats by iterating through the days and accounting for Petya's consumption. The function ensures that the number of candies given to Petya is rounded down when necessary, which aligns with the problem statement.
2. **Function `func_1(n)`**: This function uses a binary search approach to find the smallest integer `k` such that Vasya can eat at least half of the candies. The binary search is performed efficiently, and the condition inside the loop correctly checks whether Vasya can achieve his goal with a given `k`. The loop exits when `left` equals `right`, ensuring that the returned value is the smallest integer satisfying the condition.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, returning 1.
   - The binary search ensures that even very small values of `k` are considered, which is important for scenarios where `k` needs to be extremely small to satisfy the condition.
   - The rounding down of Petya's consumption is handled correctly within the function.

Given that both functions correctly implement the logic described in the problem and handle edge cases appropriately, the overall program meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
