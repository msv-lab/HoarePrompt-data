### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the minimum value of \( k \). This is a good approach because it efficiently narrows down the possible values of \( k \).

2. **Binary Search Condition**: The condition inside the binary search loop checks if Vasya can eat at least half of the candies (`can_vasya_eat_half(k)`). If true, it moves the right boundary to the middle (`right = mid`); otherwise, it moves the left boundary to one position right of the middle (`left = mid + 1`).

3. **Eating Calculation Function**: The function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` correctly simulates the process of eating candies. It alternates between Vasya and Petya, reducing the total by \( k \) for Vasya and by \( 10\% \) (rounded down) for Petya.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When there are fewer than \( k \) candies, Vasya eats all of them.
   - When there are fewer than 10 candies left, Petya doesn’t eat anything.

5. **Final Check**: The function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` returns `True` if Vasya has eaten at least half of the candies, which is correctly implemented.

6. **Detailed Analysis of `can_vasya_eat_half(k)`**:
   - The loop continues until `total` (the remaining candies) becomes zero.
   - Each iteration, if `total < k`, Vasya eats all the remaining candies.
   - Otherwise, Vasya eats `k` candies, and then Petya eats \( \text{total} // 10 \) candies.
   - The function checks if `vasya_eaten * 2` is at least `n` to determine if Vasya has eaten at least half of the candies.

However, upon closer inspection of the detailed behavior of the `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` function, we notice a potential issue. Specifically, the function does not properly account for the cumulative effect of Petya’s consumption over multiple iterations when `total` is significantly larger than `k`.

Consider the example input `n = 68`:
- With `k = 3`, the sequence of candy counts is:
  - 68 -> 65 -> 59 -> 56 -> 51 -> 48 -> 44 -> 41 -> 37 -> 34 -> 31 -> 28 -> 26 -> 23 -> 21 -> 18 -> 17 -> 14 -> 13 -> 10 -> 9 -> 6 -> 6 -> 3 -> 3 -> 0
- Total candies eaten by Vasya: 39
- Total candies eaten by Petya: 29

Here, Vasya indeed eats more than half of the candies, but the critical point is that the function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` might incorrectly fail to recognize this due to the rounding and subtraction of Petya’s consumption in a way that accumulates over iterations.

For instance, if `k` is too small, the repeated subtraction of Petya’s consumption could result in Vasya not eating enough candies in absolute terms, even though the function might still return `True` based on the cumulative sum.

Thus, the original assessment did not fully consider the intricacies of the rounding and cumulative effects in the `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` function.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was overly optimistic and did not thoroughly validate the intricate details of the function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)`. Given the specific example and the nature of the problem, the function might fail in certain scenarios due to the cumulative effect of Petya’s consumption.

Final: **False**
