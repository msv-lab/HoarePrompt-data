You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of $n$ candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.

This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\%$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats — next day Vasya eats $k$ candies again, and Petya — $10\%$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.

If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $10$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.

Your task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got. Note that the number $k$ must be integer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the initial amount of candies in the box.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal amount of $k$ that would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.


-----Example-----
Input
68

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the sample, the amount of candies, with $k=3$, would change in the following way (Vasya eats first):

$68 \to 65 \to 59 \to 56 \to 51 \to 48 \to 44 \to 41 \\ \to 37 \to 34 \to 31 \to 28 \to 26 \to 23 \to 21 \to 18 \to 17 \to 14 \\ \to 13 \to 10 \to 9 \to 6 \to 6 \to 3 \to 3 \to 0$.

In total, Vasya would eat $39$ candies, while Petya — $29$.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The function can_vasya_eat_half is a helper function that determines whether Vasya can eat at least half of the candies with a given k.
def func_1(n):
    left, right = 1, n
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if can_vasya_eat_half(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` must be greater than 1, `left` is equal to `right`, and both are the smallest integer `x` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` returns True for all integers greater than or equal to `x`.
    return left
    #`The program returns the smallest integer left (which is equal to right) such that can_vasya_eat_half(x) returns True for all integers greater than or equal to x`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the initial number of candies in a box, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It returns the smallest integer `left` (which is equal to `right`) such that the helper function `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` returns `True` for all integers greater than or equal to `x`. The function achieves this by performing a binary search to find the threshold value. After the loop concludes, `left` (and `right`) will be the smallest integer satisfying the condition. If `n` is 1, the function will return 1 because `can_vasya_eat_half(1)` is trivially `True` for the base case.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, and k is an integer representing the amount of candies Vasya eats each morning.
def can_vasya_eat_half(k):
    total = n

vasya_eaten = 0
    while total > 0:
        if total < k:
            vasya_eaten += total
            total = 0
        else:
            vasya_eaten += k
            total -= k
        
        total -= total // 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `total` is 0, and `vasya_eaten` is the sum of all candies eaten by Vasya, which is the sum of all `k` values added during iterations where `total >= k`, plus any remaining `total` value if `total < k` was true.
    return vasya_eaten * 2 >= n
    #`The program returns (vasya_eaten * 2) that is greater than or equal to n, where vasya_eaten is the sum of all k values added during iterations where total >= k, plus any remaining total value if total < k was true.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_vasya_eat_half` accepts an integer `k` as a parameter, which represents the number of candies Vasya eats each morning. It calculates the total number of candies eaten by Vasya until the box is empty, considering that every tenth of the remaining candies is given away. After the loop, the function returns whether the doubled total number of candies eaten by Vasya is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n` in the box. 

Specifically, the function iterates while there are still candies left (`total > 0`). During each iteration, it adds `k` to `vasya_eaten` as long as the remaining candies `total` are greater than or equal to `k`. If the remaining candies are less than `k`, it adds the remaining candies to `vasya_eaten` and sets `total` to 0. In each iteration, it also subtracts one-tenth of the remaining candies from `total`. If the total number of candies eaten by Vasya (`vasya_eaten * 2`) is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `k` is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n`, Vasya can eat all the candies without any being given away, and the function will return `True`.
- If `k` is very small, Vasya might eat the candies over many iterations, and the function will return `True` if the doubled total number of candies eaten is at least `n`.
- If `k` is such that it never satisfies the condition `total >= k` within the loop (e.g., if `k` is close to zero), the function will still iterate, giving away one-tenth of the remaining candies each time, and the final check will determine the return value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the minimum value of \( k \). This is a good approach because it efficiently narrows down the possible values of \( k \).

2. **Binary Search Condition**: The condition inside the binary search loop checks if Vasya can eat at least half of the candies (`can_vasya_eat_half(k)`). If true, it moves the right boundary to the middle (`right = mid`); otherwise, it moves the left boundary to one position right of the middle (`left = mid + 1`).

3. **Eating Calculation Function**: The function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` correctly simulates the process of eating candies. It alternates between Vasya and Petya, reducing the total by \( k \) for Vasya and by \( 10\% \) (rounded down) for Petya.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When there are fewer than \( k \) candies, Vasya eats all of them.
   - When there are fewer than 10 candies left, Petya doesn’t eat anything.

5. **Final Check**: The function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` returns `True` if Vasya has eaten at least half of the candies, which is correctly implemented.

Given these points, the logic and implementation of both functions seem correct and should work as intended for the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided solution.
