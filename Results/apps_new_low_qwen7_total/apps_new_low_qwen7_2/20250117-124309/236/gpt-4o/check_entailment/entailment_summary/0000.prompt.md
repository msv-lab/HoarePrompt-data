 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of $n$ candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.

This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\%$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats — next day Vasya eats $k$ candies again, and Petya — $10\%$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.

If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $10$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.

Your task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got. Note that the number $k$ must be integer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the initial amount of candies in the box.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal amount of $k$ that would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.


-----Example-----
Input
68

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the sample, the amount of candies, with $k=3$, would change in the following way (Vasya eats first):

$68 \to 65 \to 59 \to 56 \to 51 \to 48 \to 44 \to 41 \\ \to 37 \to 34 \to 31 \to 28 \to 26 \to 23 \to 21 \to 18 \to 17 \to 14 \\ \to 13 \to 10 \to 9 \to 6 \to 6 \to 3 \to 3 \to 0$.

In total, Vasya would eat $39$ candies, while Petya — $29$.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input().strip())
    print(func_1(n))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):

    (left, right) = (1, n)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_vasya_eat_half(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the initial number of candies in a box, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It returns the smallest integer `left` (which is equal to `right`) such that the helper function `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` returns `True` for all integers greater than or equal to `x`. The function achieves this by performing a binary search to find the threshold value. After the loop concludes, `left` (and `right`) will be the smallest integer satisfying the condition. If `n` is 1, the function will return 1 because `can_vasya_eat_half(1)` is trivially `True` for the base case.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def can_vasya_eat_half(k):
    total = n
    vasya_eaten = 0
    while total > 0:
        if total < k:
            vasya_eaten += total
            total = 0
        else:
            vasya_eaten += k
            total -= k
        total -= total // 10
    return vasya_eaten * 2 >= n
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `can_vasya_eat_half` accepts an integer `k` as a parameter, which represents the number of candies Vasya eats each morning. It calculates the total number of candies eaten by Vasya until the box is empty, considering that every tenth of the remaining candies is given away. After the loop, the function returns whether the doubled total number of candies eaten by Vasya is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n` in the box. 

Specifically, the function iterates while there are still candies left (`total > 0`). During each iteration, it adds `k` to `vasya_eaten` as long as the remaining candies `total` are greater than or equal to `k`. If the remaining candies are less than `k`, it adds the remaining candies to `vasya_eaten` and sets `total` to 0. In each iteration, it also subtracts one-tenth of the remaining candies from `total`. If the total number of candies eaten by Vasya (`vasya_eaten * 2`) is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `k` is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n`, Vasya can eat all the candies without any being given away, and the function will return `True`.
- If `k` is very small, Vasya might eat the candies over many iterations, and the function will return `True` if the doubled total number of candies eaten is at least `n`.
- If `k` is such that it never satisfies the condition `total >= k` within the loop (e.g., if `k` is close to zero), the function will still iterate, giving away one-tenth of the remaining candies each time, and the final check will determine the return value.
