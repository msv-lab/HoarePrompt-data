Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimal integer \( k \) such that Vasya can eat at least half of the candies initially in the box, considering both his daily consumption and Petya's nightly consumption.
2. The provided solution uses a binary search approach to find the minimum \( k \). This approach is efficient for large ranges of values, which is suitable for the given constraint \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \).
3. The `func_1` function performs a binary search between 1 and \( n \). For each midpoint value, it checks if Vasya can eat at least half the candies using the `can_vasya_eat_half` function.
4. The `can_vasya_eat_half` function simulates the consumption process, ensuring that Petya's consumption is correctly accounted for when the remaining candies are less than 10. It returns `True` if Vasya eats at least half the candies.
5. Given the detailed explanations of both functions, we can confirm that they correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. The binary search ensures the minimal \( k \) is found efficiently, and the simulation within `can_vasya_eat_half` accurately models the candy consumption process.

Therefore, the given program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
