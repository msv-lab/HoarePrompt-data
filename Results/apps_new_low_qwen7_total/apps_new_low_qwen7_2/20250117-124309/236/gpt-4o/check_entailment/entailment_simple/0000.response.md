### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Vasya starts with `n` candies and eats `k` candies each morning.
   - Petya eats 10% of the remaining candies in the evening.
   - The goal is to find the minimum `k` such that Vasya eats at least half of the candies.

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the minimum `k` efficiently.
   - `func_1` performs the binary search with `left` starting at 1 and `right` starting at `n`.

3. **Helper Function `can_vasya_eat_half`**:
   - This function simulates the process of eating candies using the given `k`.
   - It keeps track of the total candies eaten by Vasya and updates the remaining candies after Petya's turn.
   - The function returns `True` if Vasya eats at least half of the initial candies.

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search continues until `left` equals `right`.
   - If `can_vasya_eat_half(mid)` returns `True`, it means `mid` is a valid candidate, so we set `right = mid`.
   - Otherwise, we set `left = mid + 1` to search for a smaller `k`.

5. **Return Value**:
   - Once the loop exits, `left` (or `right`) will be the smallest `k` that allows Vasya to eat at least half of the candies.

### Analysis of the Code:

- The logic for the binary search and the helper function is correctly implemented.
- The helper function accurately simulates the process of eating candies and checks if Vasya eats at least half.
- The binary search ensures that the smallest possible `k` is found efficiently.

### Conclusion:

Given that the binary search and the helper function are correctly implemented to solve the problem as described, the program is correct.

### Correctness:

**True**
