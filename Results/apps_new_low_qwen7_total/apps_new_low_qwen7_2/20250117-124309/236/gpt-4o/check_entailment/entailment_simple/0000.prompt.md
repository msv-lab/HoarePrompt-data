Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of $n$ candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.

This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\%$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats — next day Vasya eats $k$ candies again, and Petya — $10\%$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.

If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $10$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.

Your task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got. Note that the number $k$ must be integer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the initial amount of candies in the box.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal amount of $k$ that would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.


-----Example-----
Input
68

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the sample, the amount of candies, with $k=3$, would change in the following way (Vasya eats first):

$68 \to 65 \to 59 \to 56 \to 51 \to 48 \to 44 \to 41 \\ \to 37 \to 34 \to 31 \to 28 \to 26 \to 23 \to 21 \to 18 \to 17 \to 14 \\ \to 13 \to 10 \to 9 \to 6 \to 6 \to 3 \to 3 \to 0$.

In total, Vasya would eat $39$ candies, while Petya — $29$.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The function can_vasya_eat_half is a helper function that determines whether Vasya can eat at least half of the candies with a given k.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` must be greater than 1, `left` is equal to `right`, and both are the smallest integer `x` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` returns True for all integers greater than or equal to `x`.
    return left
    #`The program returns the smallest integer left (which is equal to right) such that can_vasya_eat_half(x) returns True for all integers greater than or equal to x`

    total = n

vasya_eaten = 0
    while total > 0:
        if total < k:
            vasya_eaten += total
            total = 0
        else:
            vasya_eaten += k
            total -= k
        
        total -= total // 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `total` is 0, and `vasya_eaten` is the sum of all candies eaten by Vasya, which is the sum of all `k` values added during iterations where `total >= k`, plus any remaining `total` value if `total < k` was true.
    return vasya_eaten * 2 >= n
    #`The program returns (vasya_eaten * 2) that is greater than or equal to n, where vasya_eaten is the sum of all k values added during iterations where total >= k, plus any remaining total value if total < k was true.
