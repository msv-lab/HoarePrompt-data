Initial State: `n` is an integer and greater than 0, `total` is `n`, `vasya_eaten` is 0, `total` is greater than or equal to `k`

Code Block:
```
vasya_eaten += k
total -= k
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `vasya_eaten += k` adds the value of `k` to `vasya_eaten`. Since `vasya_eaten` initially is 0, it becomes `k`.
2. The second line `total -= k` subtracts the value of `k` from `total`. Since `total` initially is `n`, it becomes `n - k`.

The variable `n` remains unchanged. The precondition states that `n` is an integer and greater than 0, and `total` is `n`, so `n` remains greater than 0. Additionally, since `total` is initially `n` and we subtract `k` from it, `total` must remain greater than or equal to `k` (as long as `n` is greater than or equal to `2k`).

Output State: **n is an integer and greater than 0, vasya_eaten is k, total is n - k**
