Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `total` is greater than 0, and `vasya_eaten` is either `n + k` or `k + k` depending on whether `total < k` is true or false. If `total < k`, `vasya_eaten` is its original value plus the initial value of `total`. If `total >= k`, `vasya_eaten` is `n + k`.***
