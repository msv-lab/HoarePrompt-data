The code `total -= total // 10` updates the value of `total` by subtracting from it the integer division of `total` by 10. Since `total` is initially greater than 0, the updated value of `total` will be `total - total // 10`.

Let's denote the initial value of `total` as `T`. After the operation, the new value of `total` will be `T - T // 10`. 

- `n` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
- `total` is updated to `total - total // 10`.
- `vasya_eaten` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `total` is greater than 0 and equals to `total - total // 10`, and `vasya_eaten` is either `n + k` or `k + k` depending on whether `total < k` is true or false.**
