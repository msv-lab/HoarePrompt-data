The function `can_vasya_eat_half` accepts a parameter `k`. `k` is an integer representing the amount of candies Vasya eats each morning. The function returns `(vasya_eaten * 2)` where `vasya_eaten` is the sum of all `k` values added during iterations where the total is greater than or equal to `k`, plus any remaining total value if the total is less than `k`.
