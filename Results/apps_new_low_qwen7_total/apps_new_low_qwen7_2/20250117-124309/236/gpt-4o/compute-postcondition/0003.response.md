Initial State: `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `total` is `n`, `vasya_eaten` is 0, and the current value of `total` is lower than `k`

Code Block:
```
vasya_eaten += total
total = 0
```

Analysis:
1. The first line adds the current value of `total` to `vasya_eaten`. Initially, `total` is `n`.
2. The second line sets `total` to 0.

Given the initial conditions, let's combine these effects:
- Initially, `total` is `n`.
- After the first line, `vasya_eaten` is updated to `vasya_eaten + n`. Since `vasya_eaten` is initially 0, it becomes `n`.
- After the second line, `total` is set to 0.

Final State:
- `vasya_eaten` is `n`.
- `total` is 0.

Output State: **vasya_eaten is n, total is 0**
