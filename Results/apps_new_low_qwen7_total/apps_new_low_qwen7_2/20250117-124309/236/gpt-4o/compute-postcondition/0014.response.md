```
n = 5
total = 4
vasya_eaten = n + 2

vasya_eaten += total
total = 0
```

Analysis:
1. The first line initializes `n` to 5.
2. The second line initializes `total` to 4.
3. The third line initializes `vasya_eaten` to `n + 2`, which is 7 since `n` is 5.
4. The fourth line adds `total` to `vasya_eaten`. Since `total` is 4, `vasya_eaten` becomes 11.
5. The fifth line sets `total` to 0.

The final state includes the updated values of `vasya_eaten` and `total`, while `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.

Output State: **n is 5, total is 0, vasya_eaten is 11**
