Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `total` is greater than 0 and equals to `total - total // 10`, `vasya_eaten` is either `n + k` or `2k` depending on the initial value of `vasya_eaten`. If `total < k`, then `n` remains 5, `total` becomes 0, and `vasya_eaten` is 11. Otherwise, `n` remains greater than 0, `total` is at least 10 minus `k`, and `vasya_eaten` is either `n + k` or `2k` depending on the initial value of `vasya_eaten`, and `k` is an integer.***
