The code `total -= total // 10` subtracts `total // 10` from `total`. Given that `total` is initially greater than 0 and equals `total - total // 10`, this implies that `total` is already divisible by 10 (since `total - total // 10` would be 0). Thus, after the operation, `total` will become 0.

Let's summarize the changes:

- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `total` becomes 0 because `total -= total // 10` and `total` was initially `total - total // 10`.
- `vasya_eaten` remains either `n + k` or `2k` depending on its initial value, as the operation does not affect it.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is either `n + k` or `2k` depending on the initial value of `vasya_eaten`.**
