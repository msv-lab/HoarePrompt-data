Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `total > 0`.
2. **Determine the relevant variables**: The variables that control whether the loop can execute are `total` and `n`. Since `total` is initialized to `n` and `n` represents the initial amount of candies in the box, the loop will execute as long as `total` is greater than 0.
3. **Check the current state of the variables**:
   - `n` is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box.
   - `k` is the amount of candies Vasya eats each morning (this is not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `total` is initially set to `n`.
   - `vasya_eaten` is 0 (this is not directly relevant to the loop condition).

4. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: For the loop to execute the first time, `total` must be greater than 0. Given that `total` is initially set to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0.

Since `n` is an integer and it needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we do not need to make any adjustments to the states of the variables because the initial value of `n` should ensure that `total` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged, and the condition for the loop to execute the first time is already met with the given initial values.

**State: **`n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `total` is `n`, `vasya_eaten` is 0**
