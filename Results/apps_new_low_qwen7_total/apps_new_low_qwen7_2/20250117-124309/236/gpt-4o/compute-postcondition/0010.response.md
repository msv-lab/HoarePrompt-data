Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, total is greater than 0, vasya_eaten is n + k if total >= k, otherwise it is k + k**, k is an integer

Explanation:
1. The first line `vasya_eaten += k` increments `vasya_eaten` by the value of `k`.
2. The second line `total -= k` decrements `total` by the value of `k`.

The initial state was:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `total` must be greater than 0.
- `vasya_eaten` is either `n` or `k`, depending on whether `total < k` is true or false.

After running the code:
- If `total >= k`, then `vasya_eaten` was initially `k` and now becomes `k + k = 2k`.
- If `total < k`, then `vasya_eaten` was initially `n` and now becomes `n + k`.

The value of `k` is not specified, so it remains as an integer. The values of `n` and `total` remain as integers greater than 0, but their exact values depend on the initial conditions and the value of `k`.
