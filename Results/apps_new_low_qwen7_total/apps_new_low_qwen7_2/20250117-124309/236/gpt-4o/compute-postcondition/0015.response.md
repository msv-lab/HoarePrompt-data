Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `total` is greater than 0 and equals to `total - total // 10` (and must remain greater than 0).
- `vasya_eaten` is either `n + k` or `k + k` depending on whether `total < k` is true or false.

Code Block:
```
vasya_eaten += k
total -= k
```

Let's analyze the impact of these lines on the given state:

1. `vasya_eaten += k`: This line increments `vasya_eaten` by `k`.
2. `total -= k`: This line decrements `total` by `k`.

From the initial conditions:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `total` is greater than 0 and equals `total - total // 10`, so `total` is at least 10 (since `total - total // 10` means `total % 10` which must be positive and `total` itself must be at least 10 to satisfy the condition).
- `vasya_eaten` is either `n + k` or `k + k` depending on the value of `total` relative to `k`.

Given that the code block modifies `vasya_eaten` and `total` without affecting `n`, we need to determine the updated values of `vasya_eaten` and `total` based on the operations above.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, let's denote it as `k`. After executing the code block:
- `vasya_eaten` is incremented by `k`.
- `total` is decremented by `k`.

Thus, the final state is:
Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, total is at least 10 minus k, vasya_eaten is either n + k or 2k depending on the initial value of vasya_eaten, k is an integer**
