Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, and `k` is an integer representing the amount of candies Vasya eats each morning.
```

Code Block:
```
total = n
vasya_eaten = 0
```

Analysis:
- The first line `total = n` initializes the variable `total` to the value of `n`.
- The second line `vasya_eaten = 0` initializes the variable `vasya_eaten` to 0.

Since no operations or assignments modify `n` or `k` within this code block, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, k is an integer representing the amount of candies Vasya eats each morning, total is n, vasya_eaten is 0**
