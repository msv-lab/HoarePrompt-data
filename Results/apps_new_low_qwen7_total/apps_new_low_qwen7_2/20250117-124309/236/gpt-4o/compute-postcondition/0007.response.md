`total` is decremented by its value divided by 10 using integer division. Since `total` is either 0 or `n - k`, and `n` is an integer greater than 0, `total` will also be a non-negative integer. After performing the operation, `total` will be updated to `total - (total // 10)`. This means that `total` will be reduced by one-tenth of its value, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Given the two possible values for `total`, let's consider both cases:

1. If `total = 0`:
   - After the operation, `total` remains 0 because \(0 - (0 // 10) = 0\).

2. If `total = n - k`:
   - After the operation, `total` becomes \((n - k) - ((n - k) // 10)\). Since \(n\) and \(k\) are integers and \(n > 0\), \((n - k) // 10\) will be an integer representing the number of times 10 fits into \(n - k\). For example, if \(n - k = 25\), then \((n - k) // 10 = 2\) and \(total\) becomes \(25 - 2 = 23\).

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we keep them in the expressions for `total`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `total` is either 0 or \((n - k) - ((n - k) // 10)\), and `vasya_eaten` is either `n` or `k`, depending on whether `total < k` is true or false.**
