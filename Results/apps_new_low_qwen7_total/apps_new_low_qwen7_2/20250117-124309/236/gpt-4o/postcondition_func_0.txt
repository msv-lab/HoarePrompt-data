The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the initial number of candies in a box, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It returns the smallest integer `left` (which is equal to `right`) such that the helper function `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` returns `True` for all integers greater than or equal to `x`. The function achieves this by performing a binary search to find the threshold value. After the loop concludes, `left` (and `right`) will be the smallest integer satisfying the condition. If `n` is 1, the function will return 1 because `can_vasya_eat_half(1)` is trivially `True` for the base case.
