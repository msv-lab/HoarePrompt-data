#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The function can_vasya_eat_half is a helper function that determines whether Vasya can eat at least half of the candies with a given k.
def func_1(n):
    left, right = 1, n
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if can_vasya_eat_half(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` must be greater than 1, `left` is equal to `right`, and both are the smallest integer `x` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` returns True for all integers greater than or equal to `x`.
    return left
    #`The program returns the smallest integer left (which is equal to right) such that can_vasya_eat_half(x) returns True for all integers greater than or equal to x`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the initial number of candies in a box, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It returns the smallest integer `left` (which is equal to `right`) such that the helper function `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` returns `True` for all integers greater than or equal to `x`. The function achieves this by performing a binary search to find the threshold value. After the loop concludes, `left` (and `right`) will be the smallest integer satisfying the condition. If `n` is 1, the function will return 1 because `can_vasya_eat_half(1)` is trivially `True` for the base case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, and k is an integer representing the amount of candies Vasya eats each morning.
def can_vasya_eat_half(k):
    total = n

vasya_eaten = 0
    while total > 0:
        if total < k:
            vasya_eaten += total
            total = 0
        else:
            vasya_eaten += k
            total -= k
        
        total -= total // 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `total` is 0, and `vasya_eaten` is the sum of all candies eaten by Vasya, which is the sum of all `k` values added during iterations where `total >= k`, plus any remaining `total` value if `total < k` was true.
    return vasya_eaten * 2 >= n
    #`The program returns (vasya_eaten * 2) that is greater than or equal to n, where vasya_eaten is the sum of all k values added during iterations where total >= k, plus any remaining total value if total < k was true.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_vasya_eat_half` accepts an integer `k` as a parameter, which represents the number of candies Vasya eats each morning. It calculates the total number of candies eaten by Vasya until the box is empty, considering that every tenth of the remaining candies is given away. After the loop, the function returns whether the doubled total number of candies eaten by Vasya is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n` in the box. 

Specifically, the function iterates while there are still candies left (`total > 0`). During each iteration, it adds `k` to `vasya_eaten` as long as the remaining candies `total` are greater than or equal to `k`. If the remaining candies are less than `k`, it adds the remaining candies to `vasya_eaten` and sets `total` to 0. In each iteration, it also subtracts one-tenth of the remaining candies from `total`. If the total number of candies eaten by Vasya (`vasya_eaten * 2`) is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `k` is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n`, Vasya can eat all the candies without any being given away, and the function will return `True`.
- If `k` is very small, Vasya might eat the candies over many iterations, and the function will return `True` if the doubled total number of candies eaten is at least `n`.
- If `k` is such that it never satisfies the condition `total >= k` within the loop (e.g., if `k` is close to zero), the function will still iterate, giving away one-tenth of the remaining candies each time, and the final check will determine the return value.
