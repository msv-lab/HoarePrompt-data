The function determines the minimum integer value of `k` such that if Vasya eats candies according to the rule (taking up to `k` candies each turn) and Petya eats one-tenth of the remaining candies each turn, Vasya ends up eating at least twice as many candies as the total number of candies initially divided among them. The function returns this integer value `k`. If no such `k` is found within a reasonable range (up to \(10^{18}\)), the function will still terminate and return the last valid `k` value where Vasyaâ€™s total candies are less than double the initial number of candies.
