You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of $n$ candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.

This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\%$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats — next day Vasya eats $k$ candies again, and Petya — $10\%$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.

If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $10$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.

Your task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got. Note that the number $k$ must be integer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the initial amount of candies in the box.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal amount of $k$ that would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.


-----Example-----
Input
68

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the sample, the amount of candies, with $k=3$, would change in the following way (Vasya eats first):

$68 \to 65 \to 59 \to 56 \to 51 \to 48 \to 44 \to 41 \\ \to 37 \to 34 \to 31 \to 28 \to 26 \to 23 \to 21 \to 18 \to 17 \to 14 \\ \to 13 \to 10 \to 9 \to 6 \to 6 \to 3 \to 3 \to 0$.

In total, Vasya would eat $39$ candies, while Petya — $29$.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    while True:
        candies = n
        vasya_eaten = 0
        while candies > 0:
            vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
            candies -= min(k, candies)
            petya_eaten = candies // 10
            candies -= petya_eaten
        if vasya_eaten * 2 >= n:
            print(k)
            break
        k += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function determines the minimum integer value of `k` such that if Vasya eats candies according to the rule (taking up to `k` candies each turn) and Petya eats one-tenth of the remaining candies each turn, Vasya ends up eating at least twice as many candies as the total number of candies initially divided among them. The function returns this integer value `k`. If no such `k` is found within a reasonable range (up to \(10^{18}\)), the function will still terminate and return the last valid `k` value where Vasya’s total candies are less than double the initial number of candies.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the initial number of candies `n` from input and initializes `k` to 1.
2. **Main Loop**: 
   - Inside the main loop, `k` is incremented until a condition is met.
   - A temporary variable `candies` is set to `n` to simulate the candies available at the start of each iteration.
   - `vasya_eaten` is initialized to 0 to keep track of how many candies Vasya has eaten.
   - An inner `while` loop runs as long as there are candies left in the box.
     - Vasya eats `min(k, candies)` candies.
     - Petya eats `candies // 10` candies (with integer division, ensuring rounding down).
     - The number of candies left after both Vasya and Petya take their share is updated.
   - If the total candies eaten by Vasya is at least half of `n`, the program prints `k` and breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, `k` is incremented and the process continues.

The logic seems to correctly simulate the described process where Vasya and Petya take turns eating candies, and it checks whether the minimum value of `k` allows Vasya to eat at least half of the candies.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly simulates the process of Vasya and Petya taking candies.
- It increments `k` until the condition (`vasya_eaten * 2 >= n`) is met, ensuring the minimal `k` is found.
- The rounding down for Petya's consumption is handled appropriately using integer division.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
