Output State: **candies is 0, vasya_eaten is min(k, n), petya_eaten is candies // 10, k is increased by 1, n is greater than 0**

Explanation:
1. The first line increases `vasya_eaten` by the minimum of `k` and `candies`. This means `vasya_eaten` will be updated to `min(k, candies)`.
2. The second line decreases `candies` by the same amount, effectively setting `candies` to `candies - min(k, candies)`, which results in `candies` becoming 0 because all candies have been distributed.
3. The third line sets `petya_eaten` to `candies // 10`. Since `candies` is now 0, `petya_eaten` will also be 0.
4. The fourth line decreases `candies` by `petya_eaten`, which again leaves `candies` at 0 because `petya_eaten` is 0.

Thus, after running the entire code block, `candies` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, n)`, `petya_eaten` is 0, `k` is increased by 1, and `n` is greater than 0 (though `n` itself is not updated or printed).
