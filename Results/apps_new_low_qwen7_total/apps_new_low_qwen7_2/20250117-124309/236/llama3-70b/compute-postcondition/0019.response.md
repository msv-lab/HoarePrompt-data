Let's analyze the given code block step by step:

Initial State:
- `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, n)`
- `petya_eaten` is `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`
- `candies` must be greater than 0

Code Block:
1. `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)`
   - The value of `min(k, candies)` is added to `vasya_eaten`.
   - Since `candies` is at least as large as `min(k, candies)`, this line updates `vasya_eaten` by adding `min(k, candies)` to its current value.

2. `candies -= min(k, candies)`
   - This line subtracts `min(k, candies)` from `candies`.

3. `petya_eaten = candies // 10`
   - This line calculates the integer division of `candies` by 10 and assigns the result to `petya_eaten`.

4. `candies -= petya_eaten`
   - This line subtracts `petya_eaten` from `candies`.

Now, let's combine these effects:

- After the first line, `vasya_eaten` becomes `min(k, n) + min(k, candies)`.
- After the second line, `candies` becomes `max(candies - min(k, candies), 0)`.
- After the third line, `petya_eaten` becomes `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`.
- After the fourth line, `candies` becomes `max(candies - (candies // 10), 0)`.

Since `candies` must be greater than 0 initially and it is reduced twice, the final value of `candies` will be `0` if `candies - min(k, candies) < 10` or the remainder otherwise. However, we can express the updated values directly:

Output State: **vasya_eaten is min(k, n) + min(k, candies), petya_eaten is (candies - min(k, candies)) // 10, candies is max(candies - (candies // 10), 0)**
