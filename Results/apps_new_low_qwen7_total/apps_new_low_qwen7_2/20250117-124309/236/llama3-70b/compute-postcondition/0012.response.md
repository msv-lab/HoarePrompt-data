Postcondition: ***`vasya_eaten` is the sum of `min(k, candies)` over all iterations, `petya_eaten` is the total amount of candies eaten by Petya, `candies` is 0, and `n` is a non-negative integer. If `vasya_eaten * 2` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition holds true. If not, no change is made to the variables.***
