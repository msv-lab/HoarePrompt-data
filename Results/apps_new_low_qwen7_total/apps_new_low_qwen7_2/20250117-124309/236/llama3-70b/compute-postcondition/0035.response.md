To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's follow the given steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
- **Initial State**: 
  - `candies` is `n`
  - `vasya_eaten` is `0`
  - `petya_eaten` is `0`
  - `k` is increased by `1`

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariants**:
  - `k` is increased by `1` each time the loop runs.
  - The relationship between `candies`, `vasya_eaten`, and `petya_eaten` is key to understanding how the loop progresses.
- **Variables that change**:
  - `vasya_eaten`: Increased by `min(k, candies)`
  - `candies`: Decreased by `min(k, candies)`, then further decreased by `candies // 10` assigned to `petya_eaten`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- In each iteration, Vasya eats `min(k, candies)` candies.
- After Vasya eats, Petya eats `candies // 10` candies, reducing `candies` further.
- This process continues until `candies` becomes `0`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- Given the outputs for 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can see the pattern:
  - After 1 iteration: `candies` becomes `0`, `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, n)`, `petya_eaten` is `candies // 10`.
  - After 2 iterations: `candies` becomes `9 * candies // 10`, `vasya_eaten` is adjusted accordingly.
  - After 3 iterations: `candies` is `72`, `vasya_eaten` is `20`, `petya_eaten` is `8`.

### Final Output State
- The loop will continue to run as long as `candies > 0`.
- When `candies` becomes `0`, the loop stops.
- Each iteration reduces `candies` by `min(k, candies) + candies // 10`.

From the provided output states, we can infer the general behavior and derive the final state:

- The loop will keep running until `candies` is reduced to `0`.
- For the final state, `candies` will be `0`, and the values of `vasya_eaten` and `petya_eaten` will be the cumulative sum of their respective contributions over all iterations.

### Final Output State
- **Final Output State**: `candies` is `0`, `vasya_eaten` is the total amount eaten by Vasya (which is the sum of all `min(k, candies)` over iterations), `petya_eaten` is the total amount eaten by Petya (which is the sum of `candies // 10` over iterations), `k` is increased by the number of iterations, and `n` must have been greater than `0` initially.

Output State: **candies is 0, vasya_eaten is the total amount eaten by Vasya, petya_eaten is the total amount eaten by Petya, k is increased by the number of iterations, n is greater than 0.**
