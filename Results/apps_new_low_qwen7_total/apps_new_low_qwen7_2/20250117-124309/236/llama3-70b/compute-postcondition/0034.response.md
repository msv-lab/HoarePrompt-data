Let's analyze the given code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, candies)`
- `candies` is `9 * candies // 10`
- `petya_eaten` is `candies // 10`
- `candies` must be greater than 0

### Code Execution:

1. **First Line:**
   ```python
   vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
   ```
   - `vasya_eaten` is updated by adding `min(k, candies)` to it.

2. **Second Line:**
   ```python
   candies -= min(k, candies)
   ```
   - `candies` is decreased by `min(k, candies)`.

3. **Third Line:**
   ```python
   petya_eaten = candies // 10
   ```
   - `petya_eaten` is set to the value of `candies // 10`.

4. **Fourth Line:**
   ```python
   candies -= petya_eaten
   ```
   - `candies` is further decreased by `petya_eaten`.

### Final State Calculation:

Let's assume the initial values for `k` and `candies` (since they are not specified):

- Let `k = 10` (for simplicity)
- Let `candies = 100` (an arbitrary value greater than 0)

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `vasya_eaten = min(10, 100) = 10`
   - `candies = 9 * 100 // 10 = 90`
   - `petya_eaten = 90 // 10 = 9`

2. **After First Line:**
   - `vasya_eaten = 10 + 10 = 20`
   - `candies = 90` (unchanged from the previous line)

3. **After Second Line:**
   - `candies = 90 - 10 = 80`

4. **After Third Line:**
   - `petya_eaten = 80 // 10 = 8`
   - `candies = 80` (unchanged from the previous line)

5. **After Fourth Line:**
   - `candies = 80 - 8 = 72`

### Final Output State:
- `vasya_eaten` is 20
- `candies` is 72
- `petya_eaten` is 8

Output State: **vasya_eaten is 20, candies is 72, petya_eaten is 8**
