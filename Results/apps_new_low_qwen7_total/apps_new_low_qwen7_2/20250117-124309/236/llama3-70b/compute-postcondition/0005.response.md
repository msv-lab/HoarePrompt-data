The loop condition is `candies > 0`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `candies` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `candies` is reduced by either `k` (if `k` is less than or equal to the current value of `candies`) or by the current value of `candies` (if `k` is greater than `candies`). Thus, `candies` is now a positive integer that is less than its original value minus `min(k, candies)`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `candies` must be greater than 0.

Let's summarize the states that need to be adjusted:
- The variable `candies` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state should be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus min(k, candies), `vasya_eaten` is min(k, candies), `petya_eaten` is candies // 10, and `candies` must be greater than 0**
