Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is 1
```
candies = n
vasya_eaten = 0
```

Analysis:
- The first line assigns the value of `n` to the variable `candies`.
- The second line initializes the variable `vasya_eaten` to 0.

No other operations are performed on these variables, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, candies is n, vasya_eaten is 0**
