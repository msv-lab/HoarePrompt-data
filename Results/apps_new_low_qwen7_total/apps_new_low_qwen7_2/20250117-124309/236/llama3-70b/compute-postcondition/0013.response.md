The value of `k` is incremented by 1, which means `k` is now `k + 1`. The initial state of `vasya_eaten` and `petya_eaten` remains unchanged, and the value of `candies` and `n` also remain unchanged. The condition `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n` does not affect the values of the variables since the code only increments `k`.

Output State: **`vasya_eaten` is the sum of `min(k, candies)` over all iterations, `petya_eaten` is the total amount of candies eaten by Petya, `candies` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is incremented by 1**
