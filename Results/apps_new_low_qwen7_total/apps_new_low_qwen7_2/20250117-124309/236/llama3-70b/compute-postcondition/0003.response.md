Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while candies > 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `candies` is greater than 0.

### Step 2: Determine the Current State
The current state before entering the loop is:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `candies` is equal to `n`
- `vasya_eaten` is 0 (this variable does not affect the loop condition)

### Step 3: Check the Loop Condition
For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `candies > 0` must be true when the loop starts.

### Step 4: Verify the Current Value of `candies`
According to the given state, `candies` is equal to `n`.

Since `n` is a positive integer (\(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)), `candies` will always be greater than 0.

### Conclusion
Given that `candies` is initially equal to `n` and `n` is a positive integer, the loop condition `candies > 0` will definitely be satisfied upon entering the loop.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop executes the first time.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `candies` is `n`, `vasya_eaten` is 0**
