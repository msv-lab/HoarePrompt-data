Output State: **`vasya_eaten` is the total amount of candies eaten by Vasya, `petya_eaten` is the total amount of candies eaten by Petya, `candies` is 0, `k` is the last value of `k` for which the condition `vasya_eaten * 2 < n` holds, and `n` is a non-negative integer.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs indefinitely until `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n`.
   - In each iteration, `candies` starts as `n`.
   - `vasya_eaten` accumulates the minimum of `k` and `candies` in each inner loop iteration.
   - `petya_eaten` is set to `candies // 10` and then subtracted from `candies`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `candies`: Decreases until it becomes 0.
   - `vasya_eaten`: Increases with each iteration.
   - `petya_eaten`: Accumulates but eventually becomes 0 when `candies` is reduced.
   - `k`: Incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n`: Remains unchanged as it is only used for the termination condition.
   - `candies` and `vasya_eaten` are **invariant** in the sense that they change within the loop but `k` increases outside the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues to run as long as `vasya_eaten * 2 < n`.
   - Each time the loop iterates, `k` is incremented.
   - Once `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n`, the loop terminates, and `k` is printed.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After the loop completes, `candies` will be 0 since it is reduced to zero in each iteration.
   - `vasya_eaten` will be the sum of `min(k, candies)` over all iterations.
   - `petya_eaten` will be 0 because once `candies` reaches 0, no more candies can be given to Petya.
   - `k` will be the last value of `k` for which `vasya_eaten * 2 < n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is only checked in the condition to terminate the loop.

Thus, the final output state after the loop finishes is as described above.
