Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus min(k, candies), vasya_eaten is min(k, candies), petya_eaten is candies // 10**

Explanation:
- The first line `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)` increments `vasya_eaten` by the minimum value between `k` and `candies`. After this line, `vasya_eaten` will hold the value of `min(k, candies)`.
- The second line `candies -= min(k, candies)` subtracts the value of `min(k, candies)` from `candies`. This reduces the number of candies left by the same amount.
- The third line `petya_eaten = candies // 10` sets `petya_eaten` to one-tenth of the remaining candies (integer division).
- The fourth line `candies -= petya_eaten` subtracts `petya_eaten` from `candies`. This further reduces the number of candies by one-tenth of the current value of `candies`.

Thus, after executing all the lines, `n` is reduced by the total amount of candies eaten (i.e., `min(k, candies) + petya_eaten`), `vasya_eaten` is set to `min(k, candies)`, and `petya_eaten` is set to `candies // 10`.
