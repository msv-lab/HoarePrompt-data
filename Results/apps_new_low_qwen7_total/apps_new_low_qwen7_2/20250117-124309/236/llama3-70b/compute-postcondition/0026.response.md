`k` is incremented by 1, which means `k += 1` changes the value of `k` but does not affect the values of `candies`, `vasya_eaten`, or `petya_eaten`. The condition for `vasya_eaten` remains unchanged because the value of `k` is only updated, and there are no operations that would alter `candies`, `vasya_eaten`, or `petya_eaten`.

Output State: **`candies` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is the sum of all min(k, candies) added during each iteration, `petya_eaten` is 0, `k` is increased by 1. If `vasya_eaten` is greater than or equal to half of `n`, then `vasya_eaten` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change to the variables.**
