The loop condition is `candies > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `candies` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `candies` is 0. Therefore, `candies` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `candies` is 0
   - `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, n)`
   - `petya_eaten` is `candies // 10`
   - `k` is increased by 1
   - `n` is greater than 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `candies > 0`

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To satisfy the loop condition `candies > 0`, `candies` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `candies` is greater than 0.

State: **`candies` must be greater than 0, `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, n)`, `petya_eaten` is `candies // 10`, `k` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0**
