Output State: **vasya_eaten is min(k, n) + min(k, candies) + min(k, candies), petya_eaten is candies // 10 - candies // 10, candies is 0**

Explanation:
1. The first line `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)` adds `min(k, candies)` to the current value of `vasya_eaten`.
2. The second line `candies -= min(k, candies)` subtracts `min(k, candies)` from `candies`.
3. The third line `petya_eaten = candies // 10` sets `petya_eaten` to the integer division of `candies` by 10. Since `candies` is reduced by `min(k, candies)` in the previous step, `petya_eaten` will now be `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`.
4. The fourth line `candies -= petya_eaten` further reduces `candies` by `petya_eaten`, which is now `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`.

Since `candies` is reduced to 0 after these operations, the final state includes the updated value of `vasya_eaten` (which includes the sum of three `min(k, candies)` terms) and the final state of `petya_eaten` and `candies`.
