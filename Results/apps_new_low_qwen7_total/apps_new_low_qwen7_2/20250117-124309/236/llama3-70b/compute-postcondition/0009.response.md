Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, vasya_eaten is the sum of min(k, candies) over all iterations, petya_eaten is the total amount of candies eaten by Petya, and candies is 0.**

### Analysis:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop continues as long as `candies > 0`.
   - In each iteration, Vasya eats `min(k, candies)` candies.
   - After Vasya, Petya eats `candies // 10` candies.
   - Candies is then reduced by the amount eaten by both Vasya and Petya.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `candies`: Decreases in each iteration until it reaches 0.
   - `vasya_eaten`: Increases by `min(k, candies)` in each iteration.
   - `petya_eaten`: Accumulates the candies eaten by Petya in each iteration.
   - `k` and the initial value of `n` are constants and do not change.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - Each time through the loop, the loop reduces `candies` by `min(k, candies) + candies // 10`.
   - The loop stops when `candies` becomes 0.
   - The final value of `candies` will be 0 because the loop continues only while `candies > 0`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationships hold true as the loop progresses. Each iteration updates the candies, Vasya's eaten count, and Petya's eaten count correctly.
   - When the loop ends, `candies` is guaranteed to be 0, and the sum of `min(k, candies)` over all iterations gives the total candies eaten by Vasya.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all necessary iterations is:
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, vasya_eaten is the sum of min(k, candies) over all iterations, petya_eaten is the total amount of candies eaten by Petya, and candies is 0.**
