To provide the final output state, we need to understand the effects of each line of the given code block on the variables `vasya_eaten`, `candies`, and `petya_eaten`. Let's assume an initial state where `candies` is greater than 0 (as per the precondition), and the other variables (`vasya_eaten` and `petya_eaten`) are initialized to 0 (or not specified otherwise).

Given the code block:
```python
vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
candies -= min(k, candies)
petya_eaten = candies // 10
candies -= petya_eaten
```

Let's break down the effects:

1. **First Line**: `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)`
   - This line adds the minimum of `k` and `candies` to `vasya_eaten`.
   - Let's denote the initial value of `candies` as `C` (where `C > 0`).
   - After this line, `vasya_eaten` becomes `min(k, C)`.

2. **Second Line**: `candies -= min(k, candies)`
   - This line subtracts the minimum of `k` and `candies` from `candies`.
   - After this line, `candies` becomes `max(0, C - min(k, C))`.

3. **Third Line**: `petya_eaten = candies // 10`
   - This line sets `petya_eaten` to the integer division of `candies` by 10.
   - After this line, `petya_eaten` is `candies // 10`.

4. **Fourth Line**: `candies -= petya_eaten`
   - This line subtracts `petya_eaten` from `candies`.
   - After this line, `candies` becomes `candies - (candies // 10) = 9 * candies // 10`.

Combining these effects, the final state of the variables is:
- `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, C)`
- `candies` is `9 * C // 10`
- `petya_eaten` is `C // 10`

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **vasya_eaten is min(k, candies), candies is 9 * candies // 10, petya_eaten is candies // 10**
