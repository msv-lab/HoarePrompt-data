Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable involved in the condition of the `while` loop is `candies`.

2. **Condition of the Loop**: The loop continues as long as `candies > 0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `candies` must be greater than 0.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `candies` is equal to `n`.
   - `vasya_eaten` is 0.
   - `petya_eaten` is 0.
   - `k` is increased by 1 (this doesn't affect the loop condition directly).

4. **Determine the Necessary Condition**: For the loop to execute at least once, `candies` must be greater than 0. Given that `candies` is initially equal to `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

5. **Conclusion**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `candies` being greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`candies` is `n`, `vasya_eaten` is 0, `petya_eaten` is 0, `k` is increased by 1, and `n` must be greater than 0**.
