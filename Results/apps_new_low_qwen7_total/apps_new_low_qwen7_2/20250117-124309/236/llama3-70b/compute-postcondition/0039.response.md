`k` is incremented by 1, which means `k` is now one more than its previous value. The other variables (`vasya_eaten`, `petya_eaten`, and `n`) remain unchanged, and the condition `if vasya_eaten * 2 >= n` is still in effect, but no changes occur unless this condition is met.

Output State: **candies is 0, `k` is increased by 1, `vasya_eaten` is the total amount eaten by Vasya, `petya_eaten` is the total amount eaten by Petya, and `n` is greater than 0. If `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n`, then `candies` remains 0.**
