Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is 1**

Explanation:
- The first line reads an integer input and assigns it to `n`. This updates the value of `n` based on user input.
- The second line initializes `k` to 1, which remains unchanged throughout the code block.
- No other variables are defined or modified in the provided code block, so their initial states remain valid.
