Postcondition: **candies is 0, `k` is increased by the number of iterations, `vasya_eaten` is the total amount eaten by Vasya, `petya_eaten` is the total amount eaten by Petya, and `n` is greater than 0. If `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n`, then `candies` remains 0. Otherwise, the conditions remain as initially described.**
