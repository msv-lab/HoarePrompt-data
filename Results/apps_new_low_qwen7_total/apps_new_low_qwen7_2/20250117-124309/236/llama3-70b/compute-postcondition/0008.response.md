Let's break down the code step by step and see how it affects the variables:

1. `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)`
   - Initially, `vasya_eaten` is `2 * min(k, candies)`.
   - After this line, `vasya_eaten` becomes `2 * min(k, candies) + min(k, candies) = 3 * min(k, candies)`.

2. `candies -= min(k, candies)`
   - Initially, `candies` is greater than 0.
   - After this line, `candies` becomes `candies - min(k, candies)`.

3. `petya_eaten = candies // 10`
   - Initially, `petya_eaten` is `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`.
   - After this line, `petya_eaten` is updated to the new value of `candies // 10`.

4. `candies -= petya_eaten`
   - After the previous line, `candies` is already updated.
   - This line further reduces `candies` by the value of `petya_eaten`.

Now let's put it all together in the final state:

- `n` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it.
- `vasya_eaten` is now `3 * min(k, candies)`.
- `candies` is reduced twice: once by `min(k, candies)` and then by `candies // 10`. So, `candies` becomes `candies - min(k, candies) - (candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`.
- `petya_eaten` is updated to `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`.

The final state can be summarized as follows:
Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus min(k, candies), vasya_eaten is 3 * min(k, candies), petya_eaten is (candies - min(k, candies)) // 10, and candies is candies - min(k, candies) - (candies - min(k, candies)) // 10**
