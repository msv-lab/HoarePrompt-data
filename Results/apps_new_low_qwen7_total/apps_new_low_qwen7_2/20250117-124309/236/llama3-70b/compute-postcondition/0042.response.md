Functionality: **The function determines the minimum integer value of `k` such that if Vasya eats candies according to the rule (taking up to `k` candies each turn) and Petya eats one-tenth of the remaining candies each turn, Vasya ends up eating at least twice as many candies as the total number of candies initially divided among them. The function returns this integer value `k`. If no such `k` is found within a reasonable range (up to \(10^{18}\)), the function will still terminate and return the last valid `k` value where Vasyaâ€™s total candies are less than double the initial number of candies.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input `n` is 0, the function should immediately return 1 since Vasya would eat all the candies in the first turn, satisfying the condition `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n`.
- The function currently runs in a loop until `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n`, but there is no upper limit specified for `k`, which means it could potentially run indefinitely for very large values of `n`. However, based on the problem constraints, `n` is at most \(10^{18}\), so the function will terminate before reaching \(10^{18}\).
- The annotations suggest that `vasya_eaten` and `petya_eaten` are the total amounts of candies eaten by Vasya and Petya respectively, but the code does not explicitly initialize these variables outside the inner while loop, which might cause issues if the outer while loop never breaks. To ensure correctness, these variables should be initialized before entering the outer while loop.
