The loop condition is `candies > 0`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `candies` must be greater than 0.

Let's break down the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus `min(k, candies)`.
- `vasya_eaten` is `2 * min(k, candies)`.
- `petya_eaten` is `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`.
- `candies` becomes `candies - (candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`.

We need to ensure that `candies > 0` for the loop to continue. Since `candies` is updated as `candies - (candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`, we need to check if this update ensures that `candies` remains positive.

Given that `candies` is reduced by `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`, we need to ensure that `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10` is less than `candies`. This is always true because `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `candies`.

Therefore, the key state to adjust is `candies`, ensuring it remains greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus `min(k, candies)`, `vasya_eaten` is `2 * min(k, candies)`, `petya_eaten` is `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`, and `candies` must be greater than 0.**
