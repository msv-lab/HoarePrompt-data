Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop condition is based on the variable `candies`.

2. **Understand the Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `candies > 0`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `candies` is `n`.
   - `vasya_eaten` is `0`.
   - `petya_eaten` is the total amount of candies eaten by Petya.
   - `k` is incremented by `1`.

4. **Determine the Necessary Condition for the First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `candies` must be greater than `0`.

Given the current state, `candies` is `n`. To ensure that the loop can execute the first time, `n` must be greater than `0`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` (the initial number of candies) is greater than `0`.

State: **`candies` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 0**
