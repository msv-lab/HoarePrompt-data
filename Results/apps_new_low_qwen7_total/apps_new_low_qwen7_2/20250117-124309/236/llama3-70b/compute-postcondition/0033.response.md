The only variable in the loop head is the variable `candies`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `candies`. The loop will continue as long as `candies > 0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `candy` is updated to `9 * candies // 10`. For the loop to execute one more time, the updated value of `candies` must be greater than 0.

Given the update `candies = 9 * candies // 10`, we need to ensure that this new value of `candies` is greater than 0.

Let's denote the initial value of `candies` as `c_initial`. After the previous iteration, `candies` is updated to `9 * c_initial // 10`. For the loop to execute again, `9 * c_initial // 10` must be greater than 0.

Since `candies` is updated to `9 * candies // 10`, the condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `9 * candies // 10 > 0`. This implies that `candies` itself must be greater than 0 after the update.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the updated value of `candies` is greater than 0.

State: **`vasya_eaten` is `min(k, candies)`, `candies` is `9 * candies // 10`, `petya_eaten` is `candies // 10`, and `candies` must be greater than 0**
