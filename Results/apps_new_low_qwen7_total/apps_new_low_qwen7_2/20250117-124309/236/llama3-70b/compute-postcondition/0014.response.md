The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will execute indefinitely as long as the program state does not break out of the loop. Since there are no conditions to check within the loop head itself, no adjustments are necessary to the states provided.

Given that the loop will continue to execute regardless of the current values of `vasya_eaten`, `petya_eaten`, `candies`, `n`, and `k`, the program state remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

State: **`vasya_eaten` is the sum of `min(k, candies)` over all iterations, `petya_eaten` is the total amount of candies eaten by Petya, `candies` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is incremented by 1**
