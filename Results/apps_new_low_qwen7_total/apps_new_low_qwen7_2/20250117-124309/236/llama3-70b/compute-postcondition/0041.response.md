The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some internal logic, but since no specific logic or return conditions are provided, we can only state that it returns a value. Given the constraints, the function might return an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\), but without more details, we cannot specify the exact nature of the return value.

Functionality: **The function returns a value, which could be an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\).**
