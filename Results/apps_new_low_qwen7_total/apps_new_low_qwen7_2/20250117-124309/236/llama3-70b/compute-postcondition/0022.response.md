Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

### Initial State
- `candies` is initially `n`.
- `vasya_eaten` is initially `0`.
- `petya_eaten` is initially `0` (since it is not defined before the loop starts).
- `k` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.

### Loop Analysis
The loop continues as long as `candies > 0`.

#### Inside the Loop
1. `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)`:
   - Adds the minimum of `k` and `candies` to `vasya_eaten`.
2. `candies -= min(k, candies)`:
   - Decrements `candies` by the minimum of `k` and `candies`.
3. `petya_eaten = candies // 10`:
   - Sets `petya_eaten` to the integer division of `candies` by 10.
4. `candies -= petya_eaten`:
   - Further decrements `candies` by `petya_eaten`.

### Loop Execution
To understand the behavior, let's consider the loop running multiple times.

#### First Iteration
- `candies = n`
- `vasya_eaten += min(k, n)` → `vasya_eaten = min(k, n)`
- `candies -= min(k, n)` → `candies = n - min(k, n)`
- `petya_eaten = (n - min(k, n)) // 10` → `petya_eaten = (n - min(k, n)) // 10`
- `candies -= (n - min(k, n)) // 10` → `candies = (n - min(k, n)) - ((n - min(k, n)) // 10)`

#### Second Iteration
- `candies = (n - min(k, n)) - ((n - min(k, n)) // 10)`
- `vasya_eaten += min(k, (n - min(k, n)) - ((n - min(k, n)) // 10))` → `vasya_eaten += min(k, (n - min(k, n)) - ((n - min(k, n)) // 10))`
- `candies -= min(k, (n - min(k, n)) - ((n - min(k, n)) // 10))` → `candies -= min(k, (n - min(k, n)) - ((n - min(k, n)) // 10))`
- `petya_eaten = (new_candies // 10)` → `petya_eaten = (new_candies // 10)`
- `candies -= (new_candies // 10)` → `candies = new_candies - (new_candies // 10)`

### General Pattern
The loop continues to decrement `candies` by `min(k, candies)` and then further by `petya_eaten`. Eventually, `candies` will become 0, and the loop will stop.

### Final State
When the loop stops, `candies` will be 0. The value of `petya_eaten` will be the remainder of `candies` divided by 10, but since `candies` is 0, `petya_eaten` will also be 0. The value of `vasya_eaten` will be the sum of `min(k, n)`, `min(k, (n - min(k, n)) - ((n - min(k, n)) // 10))`, etc., until `candies` becomes 0.

### Conclusion
After all iterations, the final state will be:
- `candies` is 0.
- `vasya_eaten` is the sum of all `min(k, candies)` added during each iteration.
- `petya_eaten` is 0 because `candies` becomes 0.

Output State: **candies is 0, vasya_eaten is the sum of all min(k, candies) added during each iteration, petya_eaten is 0.**
