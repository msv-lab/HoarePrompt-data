Initial State: `vasya_eaten` is the sum of `min(k, candies)` over all iterations, `petya_eaten` is the total amount of candies eaten by Petya, `candies` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is incremented by 1

Code Block:
```
candies = n
vasya_eaten = 0
```

Analysis:
- The first line sets `candies` to the value of `n`.
- The second line initializes `vasya_eaten` to 0.

Since the initial state does not specify a particular value for `n` (other than it being a non-negative integer), we can denote it as `n` for the final state. There are no changes to `petya_eaten` or `k` from this code block, and `vasya_eaten` remains 0 because no candies have been distributed yet.

Output State: **candies is n, vasya_eaten is 0, petya_eaten is the total amount of candies eaten by Petya, k is incremented by 1**
