The initial state is as follows:
- `candies` is 0
- `vasya_eaten` is the sum of all `min(k, candies)` added during each iteration
- `petya_eaten` is 0
- `k` is increased by 1

Let's analyze the code block:

```python
candies = n
vasya_eaten = 0
```

The first line assigns the value of `n` to `candies`. However, the value of `n` is not provided in the initial state or within the code snippet, so we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `candies`. We know that `candies` will be set to `n`, where `n` is an unspecified value.

The second line sets `vasya_eaten` to 0, which means no additional value is added to `vasya_eaten` from this line.

Since `k` is increased by 1 at the start (as per the precondition), and there is no further change to `k` in this code block, `k` remains as an incremented value from its initial state.

Given the lack of specific values for `n` and `k`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **candies is n, vasya_eaten is 0, petya_eaten is 0, k is increased by 1**
