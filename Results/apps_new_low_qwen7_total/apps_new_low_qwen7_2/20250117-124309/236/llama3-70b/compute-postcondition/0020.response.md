The only variable in the loop head is `candies`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `candies`. If `candies` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candies` is updated to `max(candies - (candies // 10), 0)`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `candies` must be greater than 0 after this update.

To determine if `candies` is greater than 0 after the update, let's analyze the expression:

- `candies` is updated to `max(candies - (candies // 10), 0)`.
- This means `candies` will be greater than 0 if `candies - (candies // 10)` is positive.

Given the initial state:
- `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, n) + min(k, candies)`.
- `petya_eaten` is `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`.
- `candies` is updated to `max(candies - (candies // 10), 0)`.

For the loop to continue, `candies` must be greater than 0 after the update. Therefore, we need to ensure that `candies - (candies // 10)` is positive, which means `candies` must be greater than 0 before the update.

So, the state to be adjusted is that `candies` must be greater than 0 after the update.

State: **`vasya_eaten` is min(k, n) + min(k, candies), `petya_eaten` is (candies - min(k, candies)) // 10, `candies` must be greater than 0**
