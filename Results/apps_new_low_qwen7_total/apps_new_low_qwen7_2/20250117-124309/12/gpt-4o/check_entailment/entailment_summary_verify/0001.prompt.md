You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Joty has got a task to do. She has a line of n tiles indexed from 1 to n. She has to paint them in a strange pattern.

An unpainted tile should be painted Red if it's index is divisible by a and an unpainted tile should be painted Blue if it's index is divisible by b. So the tile with the number divisible by a and b can be either painted Red or Blue.

After her painting is done, she will get p chocolates for each tile that is painted Red and q chocolates for each tile that is painted Blue.

Note that she can paint tiles in any order she wants.

Given the required information, find the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.


-----Input-----

The only line contains five integers n, a, b, p and q (1 ≤ n, a, b, p, q ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer s — the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.

Note that the answer can be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3 12 15

Output
39

Input
20 2 3 3 5

Output
51

- Program:
(n, a, b, p, q) = map(int, input().split())
red_tiles = n // a
blue_tiles = n // b
both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)
max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)
print(max_chocolates)

def func_1(x, y):
    from math import gcd
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `x` and a tuple `y` containing five integers (a, b, p, q). It calculates the result of `x` multiplied by each element in `y` and then divides each product by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and the respective element in `y`. The function returns the sum of these results. Potential edge cases include when `x` or any element in `y` is 0 or 1, as the gcd could be 1, leading to division by 1 and no change in the value. If `x` is 1, the result simplifies to the sum of the elements in `y` divided by their respective gcds. Conversely, if any element in `y` is 1, the corresponding term in the sum will be `x` since the gcd of `x` and 1 is 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program correctly splits the tiles into three categories:
   - Tiles divisible only by `a` (red_tiles).
   - Tiles divisible only by `b` (blue_tiles).
   - Tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` (both_tiles).

2. It calculates the number of red and blue tiles using integer division:
   - `red_tiles = n // a`
   - `blue_tiles = n // b`
   - `both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)` where `func_1(a, b)` is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

3. The LCM calculation uses the formula:
   \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]
   This is implemented correctly in the function `func_1(x, y)` which returns the least common multiple of `x` and `y`.

4. The total number of chocolates is calculated as:
   \[ \text{max\_chocolates} = (p \times \text{red\_tiles}) + (q \times \text{blue\_tiles}) - (\text{both\_tiles} \times \min(p, q)) \]
   The subtraction of `both_tiles * min(p, q)` ensures that the chocolates counted for tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` are not double-counted.

5. The output prints the result, which is correct.

Therefore, the program is logically sound and should work as expected.
