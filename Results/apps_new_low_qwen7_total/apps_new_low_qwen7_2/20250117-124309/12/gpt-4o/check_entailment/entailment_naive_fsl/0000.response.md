Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of tiles that are divisible by both `a` and `b`. The function `func_1(a, b)` is intended to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, but it is incorrectly named and used in the context of finding the LCM. The LCM should be calculated using the `gcd` function correctly. However, the current implementation uses `func_1(a, b)` which may lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the formula used to subtract the number of tiles that are divisible by both `a` and `b` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the overlap.

For example, consider the input `(n, a, b, p, q) = (10, 2, 3, 10, 5)`. The correct calculation should be:

- Tiles divisible by `a` (2): 5 tiles
- Tiles divisible by `b` (3): 3 tiles
- Tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` (6): 1 tile

Using the correct LCM, we get:
\[ \text{Red tiles} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{a} \right\rfloor = 5 \]
\[ \text{Blue tiles} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor = 3 \]
\[ \text{Both tiles} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{10}{6} \right\rfloor = 1 \]

So, the maximum number of chocolates should be:
\[ \text{Max chocolates} = (5 \times 10) + (3 \times 5) - (1 \times \min(10, 5)) = 50 + 15 - 5 = 60 \]

However, the program calculates:
\[ \text{Max chocolates} = (5 \times 10) + (3 \times 5) - (\text{some incorrect value}) \]

This shows that the program does not correctly handle the case where tiles are divisible by both `a` and `b`, leading to incorrect results.
