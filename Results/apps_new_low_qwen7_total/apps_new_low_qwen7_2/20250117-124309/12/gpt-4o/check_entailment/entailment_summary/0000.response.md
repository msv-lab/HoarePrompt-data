Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the number of chocolates Joty can get by painting tiles either red or blue based on their indices being divisible by `a` or `b`, respectively. Tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` can be painted either color.
2. **Key Variables**:
   - `red_tiles`: Number of tiles divisible by `a`.
   - `blue_tiles`: Number of tiles divisible by `b`.
   - `both_tiles`: Number of tiles divisible by both `a` and `b`.
3. **Chocolates Calculation**:
   - Tiles painted red contribute `p` chocolates each.
   - Tiles painted blue contribute `q` chocolates each.
   - Since tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` can be painted either color, we need to avoid double-counting these tiles. Hence, we subtract `both_tiles * min(p, q)` to adjust the count of chocolates correctly.
4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the sum of `x` multiplied by each element in `y` (a tuple), divided by the gcd of `x` and each element in `y`.
   - However, in the provided code, `func_1` is incorrectly called with only one argument `x` and a tuple `y`, which leads to a TypeError during execution.
   - Instead, the function should be called with two arguments: `a` and `b` to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

Based on this analysis, the function `func_1` call is incorrect, leading to a potential runtime error. Therefore, the given program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
