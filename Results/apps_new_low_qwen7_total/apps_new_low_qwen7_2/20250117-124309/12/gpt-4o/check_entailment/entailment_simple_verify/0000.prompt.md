You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Joty has got a task to do. She has a line of n tiles indexed from 1 to n. She has to paint them in a strange pattern.

An unpainted tile should be painted Red if it's index is divisible by a and an unpainted tile should be painted Blue if it's index is divisible by b. So the tile with the number divisible by a and b can be either painted Red or Blue.

After her painting is done, she will get p chocolates for each tile that is painted Red and q chocolates for each tile that is painted Blue.

Note that she can paint tiles in any order she wants.

Given the required information, find the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.


-----Input-----

The only line contains five integers n, a, b, p and q (1 ≤ n, a, b, p, q ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer s — the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.

Note that the answer can be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3 12 15

Output
39

Input
20 2 3 3 5

Output
51

- Program: 
(n, a, b, p, q) = map(int, input().split())
red_tiles = n // a
blue_tiles = n // b
both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)
max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)
print(max_chocolates)

def func_1(x, y):
    from math import gcd
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)



- Annotated Code: 
(n, a, b, p, q) = map(int, input().split())
red_tiles = n // a
blue_tiles = n // b
both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)
max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)
print(max_chocolates)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing n (the number of tiles), y is a tuple of five integers (a, b, p, q) such that 1 ≤ n, a, b, p, q ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)
    #The program returns the value of x multiplied by y, where y is a tuple (a, b, p, q), and the result is divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of tiles that are divisible by both `a` and `b`. The function `func_1(a, b)` is intended to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, but it is incorrectly named and used in the context of finding the LCM. The LCM should be calculated using the `gcd` function correctly. However, the current implementation uses `func_1(a, b)` which may lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the formula used to subtract the number of tiles that are divisible by both `a` and `b` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the overlap.

For example, consider the input `(n, a, b, p, q) = (10, 2, 3, 10, 5)`. The correct calculation should be:

- Tiles divisible by `a` (2): 5 tiles
- Tiles divisible by `b` (3): 3 tiles
- Tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` (6): 1 tile

Using the correct LCM, we get:
\[ \text{Red tiles} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{a} \right\rfloor = 5 \]
\[ \text{Blue tiles} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor = 3 \]
\[ \text{Both tiles} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{10}{6} \right\rfloor = 1 \]

So, the maximum number of chocolates should be:
\[ \text{Max chocolates} = (5 \times 10) + (3 \times 5) - (1 \times \min(10, 5)) = 50 + 15 - 5 = 60 \]

However, the program calculates:
\[ \text{Max chocolates} = (5 \times 10) + (3 \times 5) - (\text{some incorrect value}) \]

This shows that the program does not correctly handle the case where tiles are divisible by both `a` and `b`, leading to incorrect results.
