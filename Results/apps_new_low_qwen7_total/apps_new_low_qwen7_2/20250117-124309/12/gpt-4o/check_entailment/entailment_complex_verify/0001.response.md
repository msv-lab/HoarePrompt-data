### Reasoning:

1. **Splitting the Tiles:**
   - The program correctly identifies three categories of tiles:
     - `red_tiles = n // a`: Tiles divisible only by `a`.
     - `blue_tiles = n // b`: Tiles divisible only by `b`.
     - `both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)`: Tiles divisible by both `a` and `b`.

2. **Least Common Multiple Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1(x, y)` correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula:
     \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]
   - This is implemented accurately as:
     ```python
     def func_1(x, y):
         from math import gcd
         return x * y // gcd(x, y)
     ```

3. **Chocolates Calculation:**
   - The calculation of the maximum number of chocolates is correct:
     \[ \text{max\_chocolates} = (p \times \text{red\_tiles}) + (q \times \text{blue\_tiles}) - (\text{both\_tiles} \times \min(p, q)) \]
   - This formula ensures that tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` are not double-counted in the chocolates.

4. **Output:**
   - The output prints the result, which is the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get, and the format is correct for large numbers.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_1(x, y)` handles edge cases well, such as when `x` or `y` is 0 or 1, and it correctly calculates the LCM.
   - For `x = 1`, the result is the sum of the elements in `y` divided by their respective gcds, which is correct.
   - For `y = 1`, the corresponding term in the sum will be `x`, which is also correct.

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get by properly splitting the tiles and accounting for those divisible by both `a` and `b`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
