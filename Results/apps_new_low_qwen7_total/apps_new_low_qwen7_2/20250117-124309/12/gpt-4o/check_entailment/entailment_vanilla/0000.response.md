Reasoning:

1. The program correctly splits the tiles into three categories:
   - Tiles divisible only by `a` (red_tiles).
   - Tiles divisible only by `b` (blue_tiles).
   - Tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` (both_tiles).

2. It calculates the number of red and blue tiles using integer division:
   - `red_tiles = n // a`
   - `blue_tiles = n // b`
   - `both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)` where `func_1(a, b)` is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

3. The LCM calculation uses the formula:
   \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]
   This is implemented correctly in the function `func_1(x, y)` which returns the least common multiple of `x` and `y`.

4. The total number of chocolates is calculated as:
   \[ \text{max\_chocolates} = (p \times \text{red\_tiles}) + (q \times \text{blue\_tiles}) - (\text{both\_tiles} \times \min(p, q)) \]
   The subtraction of `both_tiles * min(p, q)` ensures that the chocolates counted for tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` are not double-counted.

5. The output prints the result, which is correct.

Therefore, the program is logically sound and should work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
