Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the logic and verify if it matches the requirements of the problem:

1. **Dividing Tiles into Colors**: 
   - The program correctly calculates the number of tiles that should be painted Red (`red_tiles`), Blue (`blue_tiles`), and both (`both_tiles`). This is done using integer division.

2. **Adjustment for Overlap**:
   - When calculating the total number of chocolates, we need to adjust for tiles that could be painted both Red and Blue. The formula used is `red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)`. This ensures that overlapping tiles (tiles divisible by both `a` and `b`) are not counted twice. The adjustment uses the minimum chocolates between Red and Blue since those tiles can be painted either way.

3. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(x, y)` is supposed to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `x` and the first element of the tuple `y`, which is `a`. It does this by dividing the product of `x` and `a` by their GCD. However, there's a potential issue: `func_1` is called without passing the second argument `b` directly. Instead, it uses `a` as `x` and a tuple `(a, b, p, q)` as `y`, which means `y[0]` is `a`, `y[1]` is `b`, and so on. This function should instead be:
     ```python
     def func_1(x, y):
         a, b, _, _ = y
         return x * a // gcd(x, a)
     ```

4. **Input Constraints**:
   - The input constraints are respected, and the solution handles large numbers appropriately by using 64-bit integer types.

Given these points, the main issue lies in the function `func_1`. If we assume the intention was to calculate the LCM (which is done correctly in the function) but with the wrong arguments, the program logic would still be correct in terms of counting the tiles and calculating the maximum chocolates. However, since the function call is incorrect, it may lead to incorrect results if `a` and `b` are not handled properly within the function.

To conclude, the logic for calculating the maximum chocolates is sound, but the function `func_1` is incorrectly defined and should not have `b` passed as part of the tuple.

Correctness: **False**
