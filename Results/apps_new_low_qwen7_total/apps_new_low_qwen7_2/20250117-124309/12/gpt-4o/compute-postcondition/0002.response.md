Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `x` and a tuple `y` containing five integers (a, b, p, q). It calculates the result of `x` multiplied by each element in `y` and then divides each product by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and the respective element in `y`. The function returns the sum of these results. Potential edge cases include when `x` or any element in `y` is 0 or 1, as the gcd could be 1, leading to division by 1 and no change in the value. If `x` is 1, the result simplifies to the sum of the elements in `y` divided by their respective gcds. Conversely, if any element in `y` is 1, the corresponding term in the sum will be `x` since the gcd of `x` and 1 is 1.**

**The function does not perform any other actions beyond these calculations. It does not modify any input parameters; it works solely with the provided inputs to compute and return the specified value.**
