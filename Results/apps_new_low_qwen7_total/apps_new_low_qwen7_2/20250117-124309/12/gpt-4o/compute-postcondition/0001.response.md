The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x`, which is an integer representing `n` (the number of tiles), and `y`, which is a tuple of five integers `(a, b, p, q)` such that `1 ≤ n, a, b, p, q ≤ 10^9`.

The function calculates the product of `x` and each element in the tuple `y` (i.e., `x * a`, `x * b`, `x * p`, `x * q`), then finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and the elements of `y`. Finally, it returns the division of the sum of these products by the gcd.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and a tuple `y` of five integers, calculate the specified sum divided by the gcd of `x` and the elements of `y`, and return the result.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` and a tuple `y` of five integers, calculates the sum of `x` multiplied by each element in `y` divided by the gcd of `x` and the elements of `y`, and returns the result.**
