The function `func_1` accepts an integer `b` and returns a modified version of the list `tab_types`. It sets all elements in `remaining_tabs` to 0 at indices that are multiples of `k`, starting from `b`. The function iterates through two loops to achieve this:

1. The first loop starts from `b` and increments by `k` until it reaches `n-1`. During each iteration, it sets the corresponding element in `remaining_tabs` to 0.
2. The second loop starts from `b` and decrements by `k` until `i` becomes negative. It also sets the corresponding elements in `remaining_tabs` to 0 during each iteration.

After both loops have completed, the function returns the modified `remaining_tabs` list and the loop variable `i` is set to `-1`. This covers all potential cases where `b` and `n` are within their specified ranges, and `k` is a positive integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `b` is equal to `n`, the first loop will not execute, but the second loop will still start from `b` and decrement until `i` becomes negative.
- If `b` is greater than `n`, the function will raise an `IndexError` because the first loop will attempt to access an invalid index in the list. However, since the function does not explicitly handle this case, it is considered a potential error scenario.
