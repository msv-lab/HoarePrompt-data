Reasoning:
1. The given program correctly defines the main loop that iterates over each possible starting tab `b` (from 0 to `n-1`).
2. It calls `func_1(b)` for each `b`, which simulates closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`.
3. After calling `func_1(b)`, it counts the number of `1`s (test tabs) and `-1`s (social network tabs) in the modified list.
4. It updates `max_diff` with the maximum absolute difference found during these iterations.
5. The `func_1(b)` function correctly modifies the `remaining_tabs` list by setting to `0` all tabs that are closed (those at positions `i` where `i = b + ik` or `i = b - ik`).
6. The function then returns the modified list, but since the result of the function is not used except for the counts of `1`s and `-1`s, the returned list is irrelevant.

Given that the logic in the program matches the problem description and the implementation is correct in terms of logic and flow, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
