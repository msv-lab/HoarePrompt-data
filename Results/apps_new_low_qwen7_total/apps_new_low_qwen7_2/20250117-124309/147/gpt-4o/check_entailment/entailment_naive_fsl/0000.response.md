Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the process of closing tabs according to the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function sets the `remaining_tabs` elements to 0 instead of removing the tabs entirely. This means that the `count` method used to calculate `e` and `s` still counts the removed tabs, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 2
1 1 -1 1
```
- When `b = 1`, the program will set `remaining_tabs` to `[0, 1, -1, 1]`. Here, `e = 2` (two 1s), and `s = 1` (one -1), so `|e - s| = 1`.
- When `b = 3`, the program will set `remaining_tabs` to `[1, 1, 0, 1]`. Here, `e = 3` (three 1s), and `s = 0` (no -1s), so `|e - s| = 3`.

However, according to the problem description, when `b = 3`, the tabs with indices `3`, `1`, and `3 + k*2 = 5` (which is out of bounds) should be closed. Therefore, the correct `remaining_tabs` should be `[1, 1, 0, 1]`, but the program incorrectly sets `remaining_tabs[3]` to 0.

This issue leads to incorrect calculations of `e` and `s`, resulting in the wrong maximum absolute difference. Thus, the program is incorrect.
