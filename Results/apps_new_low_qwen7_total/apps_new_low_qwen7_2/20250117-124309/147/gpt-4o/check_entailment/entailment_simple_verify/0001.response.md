### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding and Logic**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum absolute difference between the number of remaining test tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`) after closing every `k`-th tab starting from a given tab `b`.
   - The main loop iterates over each possible starting tab `b` (from `0` to `n-1`), calling `func_1(b)` to simulate the tab closure process.
   - `func_1(b)` correctly sets the elements at indices that are multiples of `k` starting from `b` to `0`, effectively simulating the closure of those tabs.
   - The counts of `1`s and `-1`s in the modified list are then used to compute the differences `|e - s|` and update the maximum difference found.

2. **Function `func_1(b)` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly initializes a copy of `tab_types` to `remaining_tabs`.
   - It then iterates over indices starting from `b` up to `n-1` with a step size of `k`, setting the corresponding elements in `remaining_tabs` to `0`.
   - It also iterates over indices starting from `b` down to `0` with a step size of `-k`, setting the corresponding elements in `remaining_tabs` to `0`.
   - This ensures that all elements at positions that are multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`.

3. **Main Loop Analysis**:
   - The main loop iterates over each possible starting tab `b` (from `0` to `n-1`).
   - For each `b`, it calls `func_1(b)` to modify the `remaining_tabs` list.
   - It then counts the number of `1`s and `-1`s in the modified list.
   - It updates `max_diff` with the maximum absolute difference found during these iterations.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach correctly simulates the tab closure process for each possible starting tab `b`.
   - It accurately computes the counts of `1`s and `-1`s in the modified list.
   - It correctly updates `max_diff` with the maximum absolute difference found.

5. **Final Evaluation**:
   - Given that the logic in the program matches the problem description and the implementation is correct in terms of logic and flow, the program is indeed correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

**Final: True**
