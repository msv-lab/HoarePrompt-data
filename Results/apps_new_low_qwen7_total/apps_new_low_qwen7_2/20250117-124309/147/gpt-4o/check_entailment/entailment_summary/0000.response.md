Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to simulate the process of closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`. However, the implementation has some issues:
     - The function iterates in two directions: forward (from `b` to `n`) and backward (from `b` to `-1`). This is unnecessary and incorrect. Closing tabs in both directions will result in incorrect tab closure logic.
     - Specifically, when iterating backwards (`range(b, -1, -k)`), it will try to access indices that might be out of bounds if `b` is not a multiple of `k`.
     - The function returns the modified `remaining_tabs` list after setting elements to 0. This part of the implementation is fine but could be simplified.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly iterates over all possible choices for `b` and calculates the maximum absolute difference between the counts of remaining test and social network tabs.
   - However, the function `func_1`'s logic for setting elements to 0 is flawed as explained above, which means the `remaining_tabs` list may not accurately represent the state of the tabs after closure.

Given these observations, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic of closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`. Therefore, the results calculated by the main program will be incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
