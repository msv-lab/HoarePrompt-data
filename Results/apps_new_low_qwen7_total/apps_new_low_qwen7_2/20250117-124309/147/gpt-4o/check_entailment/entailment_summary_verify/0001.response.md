### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program logic matches the problem description and the implementation of `func_1` is sound. However, there are a few points to consider for a thorough evaluation:

1. **Function `func_1` Behavior**: 
   - The function `func_1(b)` is designed to modify the `remaining_tabs` list by setting elements to `0` based on the provided starting index `b` and interval `k`. This is done through two loops:
     - The first loop iterates from `b` to `n-1` in steps of `k`.
     - The second loop iterates from `b` to `-1` in steps of `-k`.
   - The function then returns the modified list, but as mentioned, the returned list is not used in the main logic. Instead, the counts of `1`s and `-1`s are derived from the modified list.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates over each possible starting index `b` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each `b`, `func_1(b)` is called, which modifies the `remaining_tabs` list.
   - The counts of `1`s and `-1`s are computed after modifying the list.
   - The maximum absolute difference `|e - s|` is updated accordingly.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - While the logic seems correct, there is a minor issue in how the `remaining_tabs` list is being used and returned. Since the function `func_1` is supposed to modify the `tab_types` list in place rather than returning a new list, the function should not return anything (i.e., `return None` instead of `return remaining_tabs`).
   - However, since the returned list is not used, the current implementation is technically correct in terms of achieving the desired outcome. The function could be simplified to:
     ```python
     def func_1(b):
         for i in range(b, n, k):
             remaining_tabs[i] = 0
         for i in range(b, -1, -k):
             remaining_tabs[i] = 0
     ```

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The original assessment mentions potential edge cases, but they do not affect the overall correctness of the program. The loops in `func_1` handle all possible values of `b` and `k` within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor issues noted above, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the function summary. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
