You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

- Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
tab_types = list(map(int, input().split()))
max_diff = 0
for b in range(n):
    remaining_tabs = func_1(b)
    e = remaining_tabs.count(1)
    s = remaining_tabs.count(-1)
    max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
print(max_diff)

def func_1(b):
    remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    for i in range(b, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    return remaining_tabs



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `b` and returns a modified version of the list `tab_types`. It sets all elements in `remaining_tabs` to 0 at indices that are multiples of `k`, starting from `b`. The function iterates through two loops to achieve this:

1. The first loop starts from `b` and increments by `k` until it reaches `n-1`. During each iteration, it sets the corresponding element in `remaining_tabs` to 0.
2. The second loop starts from `b` and decrements by `k` until `i` becomes negative. It also sets the corresponding elements in `remaining_tabs` to 0 during each iteration.

After both loops have completed, the function returns the modified `remaining_tabs` list and the loop variable `i` is set to `-1`. This covers all potential cases where `b` and `n` are within their specified ranges, and `k` is a positive integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `b` is equal to `n`, the first loop will not execute, but the second loop will still start from `b` and decrement until `i` becomes negative.
- If `b` is greater than `n`, the function will raise an `IndexError` because the first loop will attempt to access an invalid index in the list. However, since the function does not explicitly handle this case, it is considered a potential error scenario.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the process of closing tabs according to the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function sets the `remaining_tabs` elements to 0 instead of removing the tabs entirely. This means that the `count` method used to calculate `e` and `s` still counts the removed tabs, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 2
1 1 -1 1
```
- When `b = 1`, the program will set `remaining_tabs` to `[0, 1, -1, 1]`. Here, `e = 2` (two 1s), and `s = 1` (one -1), so `|e - s| = 1`.
- When `b = 3`, the program will set `remaining_tabs` to `[1, 1, 0, 1]`. Here, `e = 3` (three 1s), and `s = 0` (no -1s), so `|e - s| = 3`.

However, according to the problem description, when `b = 3`, the tabs with indices `3`, `1`, and `3 + k*2 = 5` (which is out of bounds) should be closed. Therefore, the correct `remaining_tabs` should be `[1, 1, 0, 1]`, but the program incorrectly sets `remaining_tabs[3]` to 0.

This issue leads to incorrect calculations of `e` and `s`, resulting in the wrong maximum absolute difference. Thus, the program is incorrect.
