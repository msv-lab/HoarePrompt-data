Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling**: 
   - The code correctly reads the input values of `n` and `k` and the list of tab types.
   - The loop iterates over possible values of `b` (the initial tab index to start the deletion process) from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Function `func_1(b)`**:
   - This function simulates the process of deleting every `k`-th tab starting from `b` and returns the updated list of tab types.
   - The first `for` loop in `func_1(b)` iterates from `b` to `n-1` in steps of `k` and sets the corresponding elements in `remaining_tabs` to `0`.
   - The second `for` loop in `func_1(b)` iterates from `b` down to `-1` in steps of `-k` and also sets the corresponding elements in `remaining_tabs` to `0`.
   - This double loop ensures that all multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, covering both forward and backward deletions.

3. **Calculation of `e` and `s`**:
   - After calling `func_1(b)`, the code counts the number of `1`s (test tabs) and `-1`s (social network tabs) in the `remaining_tabs` list.
   - It calculates the absolute difference `abs(e - s)` and keeps track of the maximum difference encountered.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the code prints the maximum absolute difference found.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The code correctly implements the logic to simulate the tab deletion process.
- The double loop in `func_1(b)` ensures that all tabs that need to be deleted are marked correctly.
- The counting of `1`s and `-1`s is done accurately.
- The maximum difference calculation is done correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the problem statement and handle all possible cases as per the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
