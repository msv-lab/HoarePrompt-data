# Problem:
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

# Annotated Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
tab_types = list(map(int, input().split()))
max_diff = 0
for b in range(n):
    remaining_tabs = func_1(b)
    e = remaining_tabs.count(1)
    s = remaining_tabs.count(-1)
    max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
print(max_diff)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n, and the list consists of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1.
def func_1(b):
    remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over indices starting from `b` up to `n-1` with a step size of `k`.
    #   - The condition for the loop to execute is `i = b + m * k` where `m` is a non-negative integer, ensuring that `i` remains within the bounds `[b, n-1]`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop.
    #   - `b` also remains constant as it is the starting index for the loop.
    #   - `remaining_tabs` is the only list that changes; its elements at indices `i` (where `i = b + m * k`) are set to `0`.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `b + m * k` is less than `n`. Once `b + m * k` exceeds `n-1`, the loop terminates.
    #   - All elements in `remaining_tabs` that correspond to indices `i` where `i = b + m * k` for valid `m` will be set to `0`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The output state correctly identifies that `remaining_tabs` has all its elements set to `0` at positions that are multiples of `k` starting from `b`.
    #   - Since the loop increments `i` by `k` each time, it ensures that all indices from `b` to the last multiple of `k` less than `n` are set to `0`.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is as described.
    for i in range(b, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, `i` is equal to `-1` (since `i` starts from `b` and decreases by `k` until it goes below `0`), and `remaining_tabs[-1]` is not defined (or can be considered as unchanged if `b - m * k` is still within bounds but negative).
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop uses `range(b, -1, -k)` which means it starts from `b` and decrements by `k` until it reaches or goes below `-1`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` and `k` remain constant.
    #   - `b` remains constant.
    #   - `remaining_tabs` is updated by setting elements at indices `i` to `0`, where `i = b - m * k` for non-negative integers `m` until `i` becomes negative.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop continues to decrement `i` by `k` until `i` is no longer a valid index in the list (`i` becomes negative). This happens when `b - m * k < 0` for some non-negative integer `m`.
    #   - After the loop, `i` will be `-1` because the loop will stop just before `i` goes below `0`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The loop sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for all valid `i` values.
    #   - When `i` is `-1`, it means the loop has completed its execution, and no further updates to `remaining_tabs` are made since `i` is no longer a valid index.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is as described.
    return remaining_tabs
    #`remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, and `i` is `-1`.
