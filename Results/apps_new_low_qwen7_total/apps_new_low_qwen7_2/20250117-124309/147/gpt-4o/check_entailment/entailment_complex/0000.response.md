Reasoning:

1. **Initial Analysis**: 
   - The code correctly initializes the input and reads the types of tabs.
   - The `func_1` function is responsible for simulating the process of closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`.
   - The main logic calculates the maximum absolute difference in the count of remaining test information tabs (1) and social network tabs (-1) by varying the initial tab `b` from which the closing process starts.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The first loop in `func_1` (from `b` to `n-1` with step `k`) correctly identifies and sets to zero the elements at indices that are multiples of `k` starting from `b`.
   - The second loop (from `b` to `-1` with step `-k`) further sets elements at indices that are multiples of `k` going backward from `b` to ensure all relevant elements are set to zero.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `b` equals `n`, the first loop does not execute, and the second loop starts from `b` and decrements until `i` becomes negative, which handles the case correctly.
   - If `b` is greater than `n`, the function will indeed raise an `IndexError`. However, since the problem statement assumes valid inputs, this is handled implicitly without explicit error handling in the function.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The main program iterates over possible starting points `b` from 0 to `n-1`, calculates the remaining counts of test information and social network tabs, and keeps track of the maximum absolute difference.

Given the above analysis, the provided code logically performs the required operations and correctly calculates the maximum absolute difference in the counts of remaining test information and social network tabs. The edge cases are handled as expected for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
