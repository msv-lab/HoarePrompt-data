You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over indices starting from `b` up to `n-1` with a step size of `k`.
    #   - The condition for the loop to execute is `i = b + m * k` where `m` is a non-negative integer, ensuring that `i` remains within the bounds `[b, n-1]`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop.
    #   - `b` also remains constant as it is the starting index for the loop.
    #   - `remaining_tabs` is the only list that changes; its elements at indices `i` (where `i = b + m * k`) are set to `0`.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `b + m * k` is less than `n`. Once `b + m * k` exceeds `n-1`, the loop terminates.
    #   - All elements in `remaining_tabs` that correspond to indices `i` where `i = b + m * k` for valid `m` will be set to `0`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The output state correctly identifies that `remaining_tabs` has all its elements set to `0` at positions that are multiples of `k` starting from `b`.
    #   - Since the loop increments `i` by `k` each time, it ensures that all indices from `b` to the last multiple of `k` less than `n` are set to `0`.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is as described.
    for i in range(b, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, `i` is equal to `-1` (since `i` starts from `b` and decreases by `k` until it goes below `0`), and `remaining_tabs[-1]` is not defined (or can be considered as unchanged if `b - m * k` is still within bounds but negative).
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop uses `range(b, -1, -k)` which means it starts from `b` and decrements by `k` until it reaches or goes below `-1`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` and `k` remain constant.
    #   - `b` remains constant.
    #   - `remaining_tabs` is updated by setting elements at indices `i` to `0`, where `i = b - m * k` for non-negative integers `m` until `i` becomes negative.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop continues to decrement `i` by `k` until `i` is no longer a valid index in the list (`i` becomes negative). This happens when `b - m * k < 0` for some non-negative integer `m`.
    #   - After the loop, `i` will be `-1` because the loop will stop just before `i` goes below `0`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The loop sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for all valid `i` values.
    #   - When `i` is `-1`, it means the loop has completed its execution, and no further updates to `remaining_tabs` are made since `i` is no longer a valid index.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is as described.
    return remaining_tabs
    #`remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, and `i` is `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `b` and returns a modified version of the list `tab_types`. It sets all elements in `remaining_tabs` to 0 at indices that are multiples of `k`, starting from `b`. The function iterates through two loops to achieve this:

1. The first loop starts from `b` and increments by `k` until it reaches `n-1`. During each iteration, it sets the corresponding element in `remaining_tabs` to 0.
2. The second loop starts from `b` and decrements by `k` until `i` becomes negative. It also sets the corresponding elements in `remaining_tabs` to 0 during each iteration.

After both loops have completed, the function returns the modified `remaining_tabs` list and the loop variable `i` is set to `-1`. This covers all potential cases where `b` and `n` are within their specified ranges, and `k` is a positive integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `b` is equal to `n`, the first loop will not execute, but the second loop will still start from `b` and decrement until `i` becomes negative.
- If `b` is greater than `n`, the function will raise an `IndexError` because the first loop will attempt to access an invalid index in the list. However, since the function does not explicitly handle this case, it is considered a potential error scenario.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the process of closing tabs according to the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function sets the `remaining_tabs` elements to 0 instead of removing the tabs entirely. This means that the `count` method used to calculate `e` and `s` still counts the removed tabs, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 2
1 1 -1 1
```
- When `b = 1`, the program will set `remaining_tabs` to `[0, 1, -1, 1]`. Here, `e = 2` (two 1s), and `s = 1` (one -1), so `|e - s| = 1`.
- When `b = 3`, the program will set `remaining_tabs` to `[1, 1, 0, 1]`. Here, `e = 3` (three 1s), and `s = 0` (no -1s), so `|e - s| = 3`.

However, according to the problem description, when `b = 3`, the tabs with indices `3`, `1`, and `3 + k*2 = 5` (which is out of bounds) should be closed. Therefore, the correct `remaining_tabs` should be `[1, 1, 0, 1]`, but the program incorrectly sets `remaining_tabs[3]` to 0.

This issue leads to incorrect calculations of `e` and `s`, resulting in the wrong maximum absolute difference. Thus, the program is incorrect.
