To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\).
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\).
- The list consists of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1.
- `remaining_tabs` is a list containing the same elements as `tab_types`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(b, n, k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Range Function**:
   - The `range(start, stop, step)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `start`, up to but not including `stop`, incrementing by `step`.
   - In this case, the loop starts at `b`, ends just before `n`, and increments by `k`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - We need to ensure that the initial value of `i` (which is `b`) is within the range generated by `range(b, n, k)`.
   - Specifically, we need `b` to be a valid starting point such that `b + k*m < n` for some integer `m`.

3. **First Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the first value generated by `range(b, n, k)` must be valid.
   - This means `b` must be less than `n` because if `b` were equal to `n`, the range would not generate any values (since it starts at `b` and stops just before `n`).

4. **Ensuring Validity**:
   - Since `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `b` must be less than `n` to allow the loop to start.
   - Additionally, `b` must be a multiple of `k` to ensure that the loop can start at `b` and increment correctly by `k`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `b` must satisfy the condition \(1 \leq b < n\) and be a multiple of `k`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, the list consists of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `remaining_tabs` is a list containing the same elements as `tab_types`**.
