Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, `i` is equal to `-1` (since `i` starts from `b` and decreases by `k` until it goes below `0`), and `remaining_tabs[-1]` is not defined (or can be considered as unchanged if `b - m * k` is still within bounds but negative).

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop uses `range(b, -1, -k)` which means it starts from `b` and decrements by `k` until it reaches or goes below `-1`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n` and `k` remain constant.
   - `b` remains constant.
   - `remaining_tabs` is updated by setting elements at indices `i` to `0`, where `i = b - m * k` for non-negative integers `m` until `i` becomes negative.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues to decrement `i` by `k` until `i` is no longer a valid index in the list (`i` becomes negative). This happens when `b - m * k < 0` for some non-negative integer `m`.
   - After the loop, `i` will be `-1` because the loop will stop just before `i` goes below `0`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for all valid `i` values.
   - When `i` is `-1`, it means the loop has completed its execution, and no further updates to `remaining_tabs` are made since `i` is no longer a valid index.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is as described.
