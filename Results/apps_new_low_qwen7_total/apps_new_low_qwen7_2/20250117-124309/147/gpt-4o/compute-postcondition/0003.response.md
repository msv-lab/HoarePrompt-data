Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\)
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`
- `remaining_tabs` is a list consisting of the same elements as `tab_types` except for `remaining_tabs[i]` which is 0

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(b, n, k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `b`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = b` to `i < n` with a step size of `k`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must satisfy `i < n`.

3. **Update States**:
   - `i` starts from `b` and increments by `k` in each iteration.
   - Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `i_prev` (which is `b + (m-1) * k` where `m` is the number of iterations completed).
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + k`.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - The loop will execute again if `i_prev + k < n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be updated to `i_prev + k`.
   - Since `b` and `k` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise, they stay the same.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

### Updated State
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\)
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`
- `i` is `i_prev + k` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `remaining_tabs` remains the same.

Given that `i` was `b + (m-1) * k` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be:

\[ i_{new} = b + m \cdot k \]

Thus, the new state before the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `i` is \(b + m \cdot k\), and `remaining_tabs` remains the same.**
