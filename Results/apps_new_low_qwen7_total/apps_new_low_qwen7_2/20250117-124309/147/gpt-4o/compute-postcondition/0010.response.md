Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\)
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`
- `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`
- `i` is equal to `b`, and `remaining_tabs[b]` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(b, -1, -k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = b` to `-1` in steps of `-k`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1 + k`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- **Initial Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `b` and the loop decrements `i` by `k` each time.
- **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1 + k`.

Given that `i` was previously `b` and it decreases by `k` each iteration, let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`.

- **Condition for Next Iteration**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i_current` must be greater than or equal to `-1 + k`.
- **New Value of `i`**: After one more iteration, `i` will be `i_current - k`.

### Updated State:
- **i**: After one more iteration, `i` will be `i_current - k`.
- **k**: No change needed for `k`.
- **n**: No change needed for `n`.
- **b**: No change needed for `b`.
- **remaining_tabs**: No change needed for `remaining_tabs` since the loop only affects the value of `i`.

### Final State:
- `i` will be `b - k` (since `i` starts at `b` and decreases by `k` each iteration).
- `k` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `remaining_tabs` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, `i` is equal to `b - k`, and `remaining_tabs[b]` is 0.**
