The code `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` sets the value of `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is already equal to `b - k`, and `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0`. Since `remaining_tabs[i]` is being set to `0` again, its value remains `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, `i` is equal to `b - k`, and `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0`**
