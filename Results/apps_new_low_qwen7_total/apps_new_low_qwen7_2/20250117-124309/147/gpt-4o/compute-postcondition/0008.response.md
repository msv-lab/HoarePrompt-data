Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Information
- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\).
  - `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\).
  - `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`.
  - `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`.

- **For Loop**:
  ```python
  for i in range(b, -1, -k):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop uses `i` as the iterator.
   - The loop runs in reverse, decrementing `i` by `k` each iteration.
   - The loop stops when `i` reaches `-1`.

2. **Condition for the First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must start from `b` and decrease by `k` until it meets the loop termination condition (`i >= -1`).

3. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - The loop starts with `i = b`.

4. **Loop Termination Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - Therefore, the first iteration requires `b` to be greater than or equal to `-1`.

5. **Constraints on `b`**:
   - We already know that `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\).
   - Since `b` must also be a multiple of `k`, this constraint is maintained.

6. **Initial State of `remaining_tabs`**:
   - The initial state of `remaining_tabs` ensures that elements at positions that are multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`.

### Final State for the First Iteration

- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `b` must be a multiple of `k` and within the range \(1 \leq b < n\).
- `remaining_tabs` is the list that will be modified in the loop.

### Conclusion

For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold:

- `b` must be a multiple of `k` and within the range \(1 \leq b < n\).
- `i` must start from `b`.

Thus, the state for the first iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, `i` must be equal to `b`.**
