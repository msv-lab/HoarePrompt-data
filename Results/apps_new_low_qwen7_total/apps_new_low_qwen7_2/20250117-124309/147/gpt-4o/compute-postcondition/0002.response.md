The code `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` changes the value of `remaining_tabs[i]` to 0. Given the initial conditions, the other variables and their states remain unchanged.

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\)
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`
- `remaining_tabs` is a list containing the same elements as `tab_types`

After executing the code, the value of `remaining_tabs[i]` is updated to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, the list `remaining_tabs` consists of the same elements as `tab_types` except for `remaining_tabs[i]` which is 0.**
