Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`.

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over indices starting from `b` up to `n-1` with a step size of `k`.
   - The condition for the loop to execute is `i = b + m * k` where `m` is a non-negative integer, ensuring that `i` remains within the bounds `[b, n-1]`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `b` also remains constant as it is the starting index for the loop.
   - `remaining_tabs` is the only list that changes; its elements at indices `i` (where `i = b + m * k`) are set to `0`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `b + m * k` is less than `n`. Once `b + m * k` exceeds `n-1`, the loop terminates.
   - All elements in `remaining_tabs` that correspond to indices `i` where `i = b + m * k` for valid `m` will be set to `0`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The output state correctly identifies that `remaining_tabs` has all its elements set to `0` at positions that are multiples of `k` starting from `b`.
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `k` each time, it ensures that all indices from `b` to the last multiple of `k` less than `n` are set to `0`.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is as described.
