Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop starts at `b` and decrements by `-k` until `i` reaches `-1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\).
   - `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`.
   - `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`.
   - `i` is equal to `b - k`.
   - `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by `-k` each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + k`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `(b - k) + k = b - k`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so these are the ones we need to adjust.
   - The value of `i` will be `b - k` (which is the same as the current value of `i`).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be greater than or equal to `-1`.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, `i` is equal to `b - k`, and `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0`**.
