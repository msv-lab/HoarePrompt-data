You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head is variable students, index and list student_list so these are the only ones that can control if the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`.

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over indices starting from `b` up to `n-1` with a step size of `k`.
   - The condition for the loop to execute is `i = b + m * k` where `m` is a non-negative integer, ensuring that `i` remains within the bounds `[b, n-1]`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `b` also remains constant as it is the starting index for the loop.
   - `remaining_tabs` is the only list that changes; its elements at indices `i` (where `i = b + m * k`) are set to `0`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `b + m * k` is less than `n`. Once `b + m * k` exceeds `n-1`, the loop terminates.
   - All elements in `remaining_tabs` that correspond to indices `i` where `i = b + m * k` for valid `m` will be set to `0`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The output state correctly identifies that `remaining_tabs` has all its elements set to `0` at positions that are multiples of `k` starting from `b`.
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `k` each time, it ensures that all indices from `b` to the last multiple of `k` less than `n` are set to `0`.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is as described.
```
for i in range(b, -1, -k):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.
