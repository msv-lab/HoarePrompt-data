You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n, and the list consists of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1.
def func_1(b):
    remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over indices starting from `b` up to `n-1` with a step size of `k`.
    #   - The condition for the loop to execute is `i = b + m * k` where `m` is a non-negative integer, ensuring that `i` remains within the bounds `[b, n-1]`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop.
    #   - `b` also remains constant as it is the starting index for the loop.
    #   - `remaining_tabs` is the only list that changes; its elements at indices `i` (where `i = b + m * k`) are set to `0`.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `b + m * k` is less than `n`. Once `b + m * k` exceeds `n-1`, the loop terminates.
    #   - All elements in `remaining_tabs` that correspond to indices `i` where `i = b + m * k` for valid `m` will be set to `0`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The output state correctly identifies that `remaining_tabs` has all its elements set to `0` at positions that are multiples of `k` starting from `b`.
    #   - Since the loop increments `i` by `k` each time, it ensures that all indices from `b` to the last multiple of `k` less than `n` are set to `0`.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is as described.
    for i in range(b, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, `i` is equal to `-1` (since `i` starts from `b` and decreases by `k` until it goes below `0`), and `remaining_tabs[-1]` is not defined (or can be considered as unchanged if `b - m * k` is still within bounds but negative).
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop uses `range(b, -1, -k)` which means it starts from `b` and decrements by `k` until it reaches or goes below `-1`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` and `k` remain constant.
    #   - `b` remains constant.
    #   - `remaining_tabs` is updated by setting elements at indices `i` to `0`, where `i = b - m * k` for non-negative integers `m` until `i` becomes negative.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop continues to decrement `i` by `k` until `i` is no longer a valid index in the list (`i` becomes negative). This happens when `b - m * k < 0` for some non-negative integer `m`.
    #   - After the loop, `i` will be `-1` because the loop will stop just before `i` goes below `0`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The loop sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for all valid `i` values.
    #   - When `i` is `-1`, it means the loop has completed its execution, and no further updates to `remaining_tabs` are made since `i` is no longer a valid index.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is as described.
    return remaining_tabs
    #`remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, and `i` is `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `b`, and returns `-1`.

```

Return Postconditions: `remaining_tabs` is a list where all elements indexed by multiples of `k` starting from `b` are set to `0`, and `i` is `-1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
