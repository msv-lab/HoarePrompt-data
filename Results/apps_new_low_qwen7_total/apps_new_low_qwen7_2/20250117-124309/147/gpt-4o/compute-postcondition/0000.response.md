The code `remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `tab_types` and assigns it to the variable `remaining_tabs`. This means that `remaining_tabs` now contains the same elements as `tab_types`, but they are two separate lists. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and the list itself remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n, the list consists of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `remaining_tabs` is a list containing the same elements as `tab_types`**.
