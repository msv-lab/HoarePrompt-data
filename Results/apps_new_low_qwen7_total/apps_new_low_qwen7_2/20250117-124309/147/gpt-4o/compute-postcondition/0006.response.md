The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `remaining_tabs[i]`. The value of `i` is defined as `b + (m+1) * k`. Since `remaining_tabs[i]` is being updated, the value of `i` remains unchanged, but `remaining_tabs[i]` is now `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `i` is `b + (m+1) * k`, and `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0`.**
