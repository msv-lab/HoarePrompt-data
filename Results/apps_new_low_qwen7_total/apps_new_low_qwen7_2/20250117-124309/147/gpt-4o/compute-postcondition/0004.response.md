`remaining_tabs[i]` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `i` is determined by the formula `b + m * k`, where `b` is a multiple of `k`, and `m` is an integer. The value of `remaining_tabs` at index `i` is set to `0`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `i` is `b + m * k`, and `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b < n\) and is a multiple of `k`, `i` is `b + m * k`, and `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0`.**
