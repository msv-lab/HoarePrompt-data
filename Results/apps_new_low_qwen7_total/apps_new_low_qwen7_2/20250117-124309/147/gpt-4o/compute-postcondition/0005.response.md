Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k < n \leq 100 \).
   - \( k \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k < n \leq 100 \).
   - \( b \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq b < n \) and is a multiple of \( k \).
   - \( i \) is \( b + m \cdot k \).
   - \( remaining\_tabs[i] \) is \( 0 \).

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(b, n, k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from `b` up to `n-1` in steps of `k`.

4. **Determine the New State:**
   - Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(b, n, k)`, the loop will continue if the current value of `i` is less than `n`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by `k`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i + k`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to update the state of `i` to `i + k`.
   - The other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, and `remaining_tabs`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

6. **Final State:**
   - The new value of `i` is `i + k`.
   - All other variables remain the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k < n \leq 100 \), `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k < n \leq 100 \), `b` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq b < n \) and is a multiple of `k`, `i` is `b + (m+1) * k`, and `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0`.**
