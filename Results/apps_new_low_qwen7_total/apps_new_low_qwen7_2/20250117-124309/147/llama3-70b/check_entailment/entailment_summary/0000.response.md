Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values \( n \) and \( k \), and the list of integers representing the types of tabs.
2. **Iteration Over Possible Values of \( b \)**: The program iterates over all possible values of \( b \) from 1 to \( n \). For each \( b \), it calculates the number of tabs with information for the test (`e`) and the number of tabs with social network content (`s`).
3. **Tab Selection Logic**: For each \( b \), it checks if the index \( i \) satisfies the condition \( (i - b) \% k \neq 0 \). If it does, it updates the counters `e` and `s` accordingly.
4. **Maximum Absolute Difference Calculation**: After calculating the counts of 1s and -1s for each \( b \), it computes the absolute difference \( |e - s| \) and keeps track of the maximum difference found.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the maximum absolute difference.

Given the logical steps and the implementation, the program correctly follows the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
