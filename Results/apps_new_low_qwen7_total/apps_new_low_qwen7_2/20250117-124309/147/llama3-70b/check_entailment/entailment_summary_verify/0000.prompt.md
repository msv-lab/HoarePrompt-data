You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = 0
    for b in range(1, n + 1):
        (e, s) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i - b) % k != 0:
                e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
                s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
    print(max_diff)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, and two integers \( n \) and \( k \) such that \( 2 \leq k < n \leq 100 \). It calculates and returns the maximum absolute difference between the counts of 1s and -1s among the segments defined by \((i - b) \% k \neq 0\) for all \( b \) from 1 to \( n \). The function iterates over all possible values of \( b \) from 1 to \( n \), maintaining counters \( e \) and \( s \) for the counts of 1s and -1s respectively, within the specified segments. The maximum absolute difference found during these iterations is stored in the variable `max_diff`, which is printed at the end.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of remaining test and social network tabs after closing every \( k \)-th tab starting from each possible initial tab \( b \). Specifically, the inner loop iterates over all tabs, which does not correctly simulate the process of closing every \( k \)-th tab starting from \( b \). Instead, it should only consider tabs that are affected by closing the \( k \)-th tab starting from \( b \).

For example, consider the input:
```
4 2
1 1 -1 1
```
The program will incorrectly count the tabs for each \( b \) from 1 to 4, but it should only consider the tabs that would be closed starting from each \( b \).

To fix this, the inner loop should only iterate over the indices that would be closed when starting from \( b \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = 0
    for b in range(1, n + 1):
        (e, s) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i - b) % k == 0:
                if tabs[i - 1] == 1:
                    e -= 1
                elif tabs[i - 1] == -1:
                    s -= 1
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
    print(max_diff)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that only the tabs that would be closed starting from \( b \) are considered, thus accurately calculating the maximum absolute difference between the remaining test and social network tabs.
