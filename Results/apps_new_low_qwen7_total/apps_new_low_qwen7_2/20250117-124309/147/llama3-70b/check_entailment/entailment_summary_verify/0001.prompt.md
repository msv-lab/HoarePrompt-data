You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = 0
    for b in range(1, n + 1):
        (e, s) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i - b) % k != 0:
                e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
                s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
    print(max_diff)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, and two integers \( n \) and \( k \) such that \( 2 \leq k < n \leq 100 \). It calculates and returns the maximum absolute difference between the counts of 1s and -1s among the segments defined by \((i - b) \% k \neq 0\) for all \( b \) from 1 to \( n \). The function iterates over all possible values of \( b \) from 1 to \( n \), maintaining counters \( e \) and \( s \) for the counts of 1s and -1s respectively, within the specified segments. The maximum absolute difference found during these iterations is stored in the variable `max_diff`, which is printed at the end.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of tabs, where each element is either `1` (information for the test) or `-1` (social network tab).

2. **Main Logic**:
   - For each possible starting tab `b` (from `1` to `n`), the program calculates how many test information tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`) remain after removing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`.
   - It updates the `max_diff` with the maximum absolute difference between `e` and `s`.

3. **Calculation of Remaining Tabs**:
   - The loop iterates over all possible starting points `b` from `1` to `n`.
   - For each `b`, it uses another loop to determine which tabs should be closed.
   - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` ensures that only tabs not being closed are considered.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic seems to handle edge cases properly, as it considers all possible starting points and checks all tabs that are not multiples of `k` from the chosen starting point `b`.

5. **Output**:
   - The final result, which is the maximum absolute difference between the number of remaining test information tabs and social network tabs, is printed.

Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the problem statement correctly. It iterates over all possible starting points and calculates the difference in counts of remaining tabs for each case, ensuring that the maximum possible difference is found.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program is logically sound and correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement.
