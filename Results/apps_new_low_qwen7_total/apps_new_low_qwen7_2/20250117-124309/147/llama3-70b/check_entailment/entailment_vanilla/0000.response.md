### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of tabs, where each element is either `1` (information for the test) or `-1` (social network tab).

2. **Main Logic**:
   - For each possible starting tab `b` (from `1` to `n`), the program calculates how many test information tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`) remain after removing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`.
   - It updates the `max_diff` with the maximum absolute difference between `e` and `s`.

3. **Calculation of Remaining Tabs**:
   - The loop iterates over all possible starting points `b` from `1` to `n`.
   - For each `b`, it uses another loop to determine which tabs should be closed.
   - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` ensures that only tabs not being closed are considered.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic seems to handle edge cases properly, as it considers all possible starting points and checks all tabs that are not multiples of `k` from the chosen starting point `b`.

5. **Output**:
   - The final result, which is the maximum absolute difference between the number of remaining test information tabs and social network tabs, is printed.

Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the problem statement correctly. It iterates over all possible starting points and calculates the difference in counts of remaining tabs for each case, ensuring that the maximum possible difference is found.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program is logically sound and correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement.
