Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of remaining test and social network tabs after closing every \( k \)-th tab starting from each possible initial tab \( b \). Specifically, the inner loop iterates over all tabs, which does not correctly simulate the process of closing every \( k \)-th tab starting from \( b \). Instead, it should only consider tabs that are affected by closing the \( k \)-th tab starting from \( b \).

For example, consider the input:
```
4 2
1 1 -1 1
```
The program will incorrectly count the tabs for each \( b \) from 1 to 4, but it should only consider the tabs that would be closed starting from each \( b \).

To fix this, the inner loop should only iterate over the indices that would be closed when starting from \( b \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = 0
    for b in range(1, n + 1):
        (e, s) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i - b) % k == 0:
                if tabs[i - 1] == 1:
                    e -= 1
                elif tabs[i - 1] == -1:
                    s -= 1
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
    print(max_diff)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that only the tabs that would be closed starting from \( b \) are considered, thus accurately calculating the maximum absolute difference between the remaining test and social network tabs.
