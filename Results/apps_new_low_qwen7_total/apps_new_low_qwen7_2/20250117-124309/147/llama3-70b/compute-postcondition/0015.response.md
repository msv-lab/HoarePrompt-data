Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `b` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is 1
   - `max_diff` is `abs(e - s)`
   - `e` is the sum of `tabs[i-1] == 1` for all `i` where `(i - 1) % k != 0`
   - `s` is the sum of `tabs[i-1] == -1` for all `i` where `(i - 1) % k != 0`
   - `n` is the total number of iterations
   - `i` is `n + 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `b = 1` to `b = n`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `b = 1` to `b = n`, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if `b` is currently 1, the next value of `b` will be 2.
   - The other variables (`max_diff`, `e`, `s`, `n`, and `i`) do not change within the loop head and are not directly affected by the loop condition itself.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `b` will be 2.
   - `max_diff`, `e`, `s`, `n`, and `i` remain the same as the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`b` is 2, `max_diff` is `abs(e - s)`, `e` is the sum of `tabs[i-1] == 1` for all `i` where `(i - 1) % k != 0`, `s` is the sum of `tabs[i-1] == -1` for all `i` where `(i - 1) % k != 0`, `n` is the total number of iterations, `i` is `n + 1**.
