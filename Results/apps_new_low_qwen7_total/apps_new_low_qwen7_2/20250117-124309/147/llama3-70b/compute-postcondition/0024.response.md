Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is 2
   - `max_diff` is 0
   - `e` is 1
   - `s` is 0
   - `n` is at least 4
   - `i` is 3

4. **Update the value of `i` for the next iteration**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, `i` will be updated to `i + 1`. Therefore, `i` will be 4 in the next iteration.
5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be 4) must still be less than or equal to `n` (which is at least 4). This condition is satisfied because 4 is less than or equal to 4.

Since the loop will continue and `i` is incremented to 4, we need to adjust the state accordingly:

**State: **`b` is 2, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is 1, `s` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 4**
