Output State: **b is 1, max_diff is 0, e is 0, s is 0, n is greater than or equal to 2, i is 3**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `b` being 1, `max_diff` being 0, `e` being 0, `s` being 0, `n` being greater than or equal to 2, and `i` being 3.
- The code block does not modify any of these variables or introduce new ones.
- The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if `tabs[i - 1]` (which is `tabs[2]` since `i` is 3) is equal to 1 and increments `e` by 1 if true. However, since `tabs` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact value of `e`. But since no further information about `tabs` is provided, we assume it does not change `e`.
- The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if `tabs[i - 1]` (again `tabs[2]`) is equal to -1 and increments `s` by 1 if true. Similarly, without knowing `tabs`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. Assuming it does not change `s` either.

Given the lack of additional context or definition for `tabs`, the values of `e` and `s` remain unchanged at 0. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions provided.
