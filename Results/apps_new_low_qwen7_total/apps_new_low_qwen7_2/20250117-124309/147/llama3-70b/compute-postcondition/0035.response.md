Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i`, `b`, `k`, `e`, and `s` are integers.
   - If `(i - b) % k` is not equal to 0, no changes are made to the variables.

4. **Check the condition `(i - b) % k != 0`**:
   - Since this condition does not affect `i` or `n`, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged if the condition is true.
   - Therefore, we need to check if `i` is still within the range to determine if the loop should continue.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - If the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is true, then `i` remains the same.
   - To proceed to the next iteration, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Given the loop and the condition, if the loop continues to the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Final state**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged.
   - The other variables (`b`, `k`, `e`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` is `b`, `k` is `k`, `e` is `e`, `s` is `s`, `n` is `n`**
