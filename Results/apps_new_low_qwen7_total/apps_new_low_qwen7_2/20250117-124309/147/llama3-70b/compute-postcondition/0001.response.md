Let's break down the given information and determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Information:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\).
- There is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer is either 1 or -1.
- `max_diff` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for b in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `b`:**
   - The loop variable `b` starts from 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches \(n\). Therefore, for the first iteration, `b` should be 1.

2. **List of \(n\) integers:**
   - This list contains \(n\) elements, each being either 1 or -1. The state of this list remains unchanged within the loop.

3. **Variable `max_diff`:**
   - `max_diff` is initialized to 0. This value is used to keep track of the maximum difference encountered during the iterations of the loop, but its initial value does not affect the condition for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - Since there are no other variables mentioned in the loop head (the only variables involved in the loop are `b` and the loop itself), we only need to consider `b`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the loop variable `b` must be set to 1. The list of integers and `max_diff` remain as they are initially defined.

### Final State:
- `b` must be 1.
- The list of \(n\) integers remains unchanged.
- `max_diff` remains 0.

Therefore, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: **`b` is 1, list of n integers remains as initially defined, `max_diff` is 0**
