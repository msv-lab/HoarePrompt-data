Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `n + 1`. The loop increments `i` starting from `n + 1` but since the loop starts from 1, `i` will range from 1 to `n`.

### Track Variable Changes
- **Invariants**: 
  - `b` remains 2.
  - `max_diff` remains 0.
  - `n` is the total number of iterations, and it does not change inside the loop.
  - `i` starts at `n + 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`, so `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop ends.

- **Variables that change**:
  - `e` increases by 1 if `(i - b) % k != 0` and `tabs[i - 1] == 1`.
  - `s` increases by 1 if `(i - b) % k != 0` and `tabs[i - 1] == -1`.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will execute `n` times, as `i` goes from 1 to `n`. Each iteration checks the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` and updates `e` and `s` accordingly.

### Verify Relationships
- After the loop, `i` will be `n + 1` because it starts at `n + 1` and increments by 1 each time.
- `b` and `max_diff` remain unchanged at 2 and 0 respectively.
- `e` and `s` are updated based on the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` and the value of `tabs[i - 1]`.

### Calculate the Final Output State
Since the loop runs exactly `n` times, we need to consider the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` for each iteration.

- If `(i - b) % k != 0` and `tabs[i - 1] == 1`, then `e` increases by 1.
- If `(i - b) % k != 0` and `tabs[i - 1] == -1`, then `s` increases by 1.

Without specific values for `tabs` and `k`, we cannot determine exact values for `e` and `s`. However, we can describe the final state in terms of these conditions.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`b` is 2, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is the number of times the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` and `tabs[i - 1] == 1` was true, `s` is the number of times the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` and `tabs[i - 1] == -1` was true, `n` is the total number of iterations, and `i` is `n + 1` after the loop ends.**
