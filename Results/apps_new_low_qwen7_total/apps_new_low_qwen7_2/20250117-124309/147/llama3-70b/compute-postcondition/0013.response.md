Let's analyze the given loop and initial state step by step.

### Initial State
- `b` is 1
- `max_diff` is 0
- `e` is 0
- `s` is 0

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The condition inside the loop checks if `(i - b) % k != 0`. If this condition is true, two operations are performed:
1. `e` is incremented by `tabs[i - 1] == 1`.
2. `s` is incremented by `tabs[i - 1] == -1`.

### Key Observations
- `b` remains unchanged throughout the loop since it is only used in the condition and not modified.
- `max_diff` is not mentioned in the loop, so it remains unchanged.
- `e` and `s` are updated based on the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` and the values in `tabs`.

### Loop Execution
Since the problem specifies the state after the loop has executed 1, 2, and 3 times, we can infer that the loop increments `i` each time it runs and continues until `i` reaches `n + 1`.

- After the first iteration (`i = 2`):
  - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is true.
  - Therefore, `e` will be incremented by `tabs[1] == 1` and `s` by `tabs[1] == -1`.

- After the second iteration (`i = 3`):
  - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is true.
  - Therefore, `e` will be incremented by `tabs[2] == 1` and `s` by `tabs[2] == -1`.

- After the third iteration (`i = 4`):
  - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is true.
  - Therefore, `e` will be incremented by `tabs[3] == 1` and `s` by `tabs[3] == -1`.

### Final State
Since the loop continues until `i` reaches `n + 1`, the loop will execute `n` times. Each time the condition is true, `e` and `s` will be incremented by the corresponding values in `tabs`.

Therefore, after the loop completes:
- `b` remains 1.
- `max_diff` remains 0.
- `e` will be the sum of `tabs[i-1] == 1` for all `i` where `(i - b) % k != 0`.
- `s` will be the sum of `tabs[i-1] == -1` for all `i` where `(i - b) % k != 0`.
- `n` will be the total number of iterations, which is `i - 1` at the end of the loop.

### Output State
Output State: **`b` is 1, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is the sum of `tabs[i-1] == 1` for all `i` where `(i - 1) % k != 0`, `s` is the sum of `tabs[i-1] == -1` for all `i` where `(i - 1) % k != 0`, `n` is the total number of iterations, `i` is `n + 1`.**
