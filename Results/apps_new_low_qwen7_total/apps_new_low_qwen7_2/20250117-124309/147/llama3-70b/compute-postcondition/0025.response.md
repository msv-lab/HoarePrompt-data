Output State: **b is 2, max_diff is 0, e is 1, s is 0, n is at least 4, i is 4**

Explanation:
- The initial state is given as: `b` is 2, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is 1, `s` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 4.
- The code snippet modifies the values of `e` and `s`.
  - The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1`: This line checks if `tabs[i - 1]` (which is `tabs[3]` since `i` is 4) is equal to 1. However, `tabs` is not defined in the given code or initial state, so this line cannot be executed as-is without additional context. Assuming `tabs[i - 1]` is not 1, `e` remains unchanged, still 1.
  - The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1`: Similarly, this line checks if `tabs[i - 1]` is equal to -1. Again, without the definition of `tabs`, we cannot determine the exact change to `s`. Assuming `tabs[i - 1]` is not -1, `s` remains unchanged, still 0.

Since the exact values of `tabs[i - 1]` are not provided, we assume they do not affect the values of `e` and `s` based on the given conditions. Therefore, the final state remains the same as the initial state.
