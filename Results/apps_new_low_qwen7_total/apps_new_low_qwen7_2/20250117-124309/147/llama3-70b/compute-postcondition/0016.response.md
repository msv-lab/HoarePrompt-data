In the initial state, `b` is 2, `max_diff` is `abs(e - s)`, `e` is the sum of `tabs[i-1] == 1` for all `i` where `(i - 1) % k != 0`, `s` is the sum of `tabs[i-1] == -1` for all `i` where `(i - 1) % k != 0`, `n` is the total number of iterations, and `i` is `n + 1`.

The code snippet `e, s = 0, 0` sets both `e` and `s` to 0.

Since `e` and `s` are updated to 0, `max_diff` remains unchanged because it was initially defined as `abs(e - s)` and now `e` and `s` are both 0, making `max_diff` also 0.

Output State: **`b` is 2, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is the total number of iterations, `i` is `n + 1`**
