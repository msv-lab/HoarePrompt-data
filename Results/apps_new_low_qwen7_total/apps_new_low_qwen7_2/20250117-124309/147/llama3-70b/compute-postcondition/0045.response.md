The function `func` accepts a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, and two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information, but based on typical function behavior, it might be expected to return a value or perform some operation. Given the output cases are not specified, we assume the function returns the count of subarrays of length `k` whose product is positive.

However, following the format strictly:
