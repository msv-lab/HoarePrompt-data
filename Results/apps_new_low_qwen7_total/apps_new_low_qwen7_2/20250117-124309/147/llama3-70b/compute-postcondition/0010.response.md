Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `b` is 1
   - `max_diff` is 0
   - `e` is 0
   - `s` is 0
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2
   - `i` is 3

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - The loop variable `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration.

4. **Condition to Execute the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

5. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 4 if `i` is still within the range.

6. **Checking the Range:**
   - We know that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 4, and since `n` is at least 2, `i` will be within the range (1 to `n`).

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, and it will be incremented to 4, the loop will execute again if `n` is at least 4. The other variables (`b`, `max_diff`, `e`, `s`) will retain their values as they are not modified by the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`b` is 1, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4**
