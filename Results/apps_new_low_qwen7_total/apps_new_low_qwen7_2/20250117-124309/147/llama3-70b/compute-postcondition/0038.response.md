Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `e` is incremented by 1 if `tabs[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise `e` remains unchanged.
- `s` is incremented by 1 if `tabs[i - 1]` is -1, otherwise `s` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.

### Loop Header:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
2. **Incrementing `i`**: The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's determine the new value of `i`.

- If the loop just ended, `i` was incremented by 1, meaning `i` was `i_old + 1` where `i_old` was the value of `i` at the start of the previous iteration.
- For the next iteration, `i` needs to be `i_old + 2` (since it starts from 1 and increments by 1).

Since `n` remains unchanged, it still holds the same value as before the loop started.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration:
- `i` should be `i_old + 2`.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `e` remains unchanged unless `tabs[i_old + 1]` is 1.
- `s` remains unchanged unless `tabs[i_old + 1]` is -1.
- `n` remains unchanged.

However, since we only need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head and not the actual loop condition, we focus on `i`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2 more than its initial value, `b` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `e` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged.**

If `i` was `x` initially, then:
- `i` is now `x + 2`.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `e` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`i` is 2 more than its initial value, `b` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `e` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged.**
