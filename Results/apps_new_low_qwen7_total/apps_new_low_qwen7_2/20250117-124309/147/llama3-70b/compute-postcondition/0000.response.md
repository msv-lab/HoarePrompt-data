The given code snippet reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, followed by a list of `n` integers (each being either 1 or -1) from input, and initializes `max_diff` to 0. However, the code does not proceed to calculate or update `max_diff` further, so `max_diff` remains at 0.

The initial state provided states that `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), and there is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1. After reading the inputs, these conditions and the list remain unchanged except for the introduction of the variable `max_diff` set to 0.

Since no operations are performed on `n`, `k`, or the list `tabs` (referred to as `tabs` in the example but should be renamed to `nums` for clarity), and `max_diff` remains unchanged at 0, the final state is the same as the initial state with the addition of the `max_diff` variable.

Output State: **n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, max_diff is 0**
