The code assigns `0` to both `e` and `s`. This means the values of `e` and `s` are explicitly set to `0`, overriding their previous values which were defined as `e` being the number of times the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` and `tabs[i - 1] == 1` was true, and `s` being the number of times the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` and `tabs[i - 1] == -1` was true.

All other variables remain in their previous states as per the initial conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is `3`, `max_diff` is `abs(e - s)`, `e` is `0`, `s` is `0`, `n` is the total number of iterations, and `i` is `n + 1` after the loop ends.

Output State: **`b` is `3`, `max_diff` is `abs(0 - 0)`, `e` is `0`, `s` is `0`, `n` is the total number of iterations, and `i` is `n + 1` after the loop ends.**
