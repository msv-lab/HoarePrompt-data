Output State: **i is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer, e is an integer, s is an integer**

Explanation:
- The code snippet provided does not initialize the variable `tabs` or define the variable `e` and `s` before using them. Therefore, we assume they are initialized to 0 (or some default integer value) before this code block is executed.
- The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` in the `tabs` list is equal to 1. If it is, then `e` is incremented by 1.
- The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` in the `tabs` list is equal to -1. If it is, then `s` is incremented by 1.
- However, without the actual content of `tabs`, we cannot determine the exact values of `e` and `s`. We can only state that `e` will be incremented by 1 if `tabs[i - 1]` is 1, and `s` will be incremented by 1 if `tabs[i - 1]` is -1. 

Since the problem does not provide the content of `tabs`, the final values of `e` and `s` remain unknown based on the given information. The other variables (`i`, `b`, `k`) are not modified by the provided code block.
