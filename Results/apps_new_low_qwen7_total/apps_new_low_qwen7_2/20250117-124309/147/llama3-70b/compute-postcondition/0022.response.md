Output State: **b is 2, max_diff is 0, e is 1 (assuming tabs[2] == 1), s is 0 (assuming tabs[2] == -1), n is at least 4, i is 3**

Explanation:
- The initial values are `b` is 2, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is either 0 or 1, `s` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 4, and `i` is 3.
- The code block consists of two lines:
  1. `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1`: This line checks if `tabs[i - 1]` is equal to 1 (where `i` is 3, so it checks `tabs[2]`). If `tabs[2]` is 1, `e` is incremented by 1. Assuming `tabs[2]` is 1, `e` becomes 1.
  2. `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1`: This line checks if `tabs[i - 1]` is equal to -1. If `tabs[2]` is -1, `s` is incremented by 1. However, since `tabs[2]` is assumed to be 1, `s` remains 0.

No other variables are affected by this code block. Therefore, the final state includes the updated values of `e` and `s` based on the assumption that `tabs[2]` is 1.
