Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive.

3. **Current Values**:
   - `b` is 1
   - `max_diff` is 0
   - `e` is 0
   - `s` is 0
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `i` is 2
   - The current value of `(i - b) % k` is not equal to 0

4. **Next Iteration Check**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2 and the condition `i < n + 1` must hold, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (since if `n` were 1, `i` would already be at its maximum value).

5. **Adjust States**:
   - `i` will increment by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as we only know it must be greater than or equal to 1 initially but now must be at least 2 to allow for another iteration.

6. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`b`, `max_diff`, `e`, `s`) are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged.

Based on these steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

State: **`b` is 1, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3**
