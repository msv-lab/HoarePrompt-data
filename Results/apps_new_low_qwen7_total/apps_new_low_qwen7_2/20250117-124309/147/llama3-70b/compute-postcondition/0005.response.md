Output State: **b is 1, max_diff is 0, e is 0, s is 0, n is greater than or equal to 1, i is 2, and the current value of (i - b) % k is not equal to 0**

Explanation:
- The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if `tabs[i - 1]` (which is `tabs[1]` since `i` is 1 initially) is equal to 1. If `tabs[1]` is 1, then `e` is incremented by 1. However, the value of `tabs[1]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `e`. Given no specific value for `tabs[1]`, `e` remains 0.
- The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if `tabs[i - 1]` (again, `tabs[1]`) is equal to -1. If `tabs[1]` is -1, then `s` is incremented by 1. Similarly, since the value of `tabs[1]` is not provided, `s` remains 0.
- The variables `b`, `max_diff`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by these lines, so they remain as specified in the initial state.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2.
- The condition `(i - b) % k` is not equal to 0 is also not affected by these lines, as no operations change the value of `i` or `b`. Therefore, this condition still holds true.
