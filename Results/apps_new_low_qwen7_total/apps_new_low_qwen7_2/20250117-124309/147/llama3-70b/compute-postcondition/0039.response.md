Initial State: `i` is 2 more than its initial value, `b` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `e` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged.
```

Code Block:
```
e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
```

To determine the final state, we need to know the value of `tabs[i - 1]`. However, since this value is not provided, let's denote it as `val`.

The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if `tabs[i - 1]` is equal to 1. If it is, `e` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `e` remains unchanged.

The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if `tabs[i - 1]` is equal to -1. If it is, `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

Since the initial state does not provide the specific value of `tabs[i - 1]`, let's assume the following for the sake of this example (we'll use a hypothetical value to illustrate the process):

Assume `tabs[i - 1]` is 1.

Final Calculation:
- `e` is incremented by 1 because `tabs[i - 1]` is 1.
- `s` remains unchanged because `tabs[i - 1]` is not -1.

Thus, the updated values are:
- `e` is increased by 1.
- `s` remains unchanged.

Given that `i` is 2 more than its initial value, and the other variables (`b`, `k`, `n`, `s`) remain unchanged, the final output state is:

Output State: **i is 2 more than its initial value, b remains unchanged, k remains unchanged, e is e + 1, s remains unchanged, and n remains unchanged**
