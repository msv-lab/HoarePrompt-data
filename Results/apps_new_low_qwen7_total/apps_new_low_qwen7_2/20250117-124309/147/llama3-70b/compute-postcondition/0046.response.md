Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, and two integers \( n \) and \( k \) such that \( 2 \leq k < n \leq 100 \). It calculates and returns the maximum absolute difference between the counts of 1s and -1s among the segments defined by \((i - b) \% k \neq 0\) for all \( b \) from 1 to \( n \). The function iterates over all possible values of \( b \) from 1 to \( n \), maintaining counters \( e \) and \( s \) for the counts of 1s and -1s respectively, within the specified segments. The maximum absolute difference found during these iterations is stored in the variable `max_diff`, which is printed at the end.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the function will iterate over \( b \) from 1 to 2. For \( b = 1 \), the segment will include both elements since \((i - 1) \% 2 \neq 0\) for both \( i = 1 \) and \( i = 2 \). For \( b = 2 \), the segment will again include both elements since \((i - 2) \% 2 \neq 0\) for both \( i = 1 \) and \( i = 2 \).
- If the list contains only 1s or only -1s, the function will return 0 because the difference between the counts of 1s and -1s will always be 0.
- If the list alternates between 1 and -1, the function will return 1 because the difference between the counts of 1s and -1s will be 1 for any valid segment size \( k \).

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no return statement in the function, but based on the annotations and the return postconditions, the function should return the value of `max_diff`. Therefore, the function should have a return statement like `return max_diff` at the end.
