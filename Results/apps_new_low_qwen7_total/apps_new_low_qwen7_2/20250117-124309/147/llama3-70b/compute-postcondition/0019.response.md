The initial state is: `b` is 2, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` minus `b` is not divisible by `k`.

The code snippet is:
```python
e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
```

This code updates the variables `e` and `s` based on the value of `tabs[i - 1]`. However, since the variable `tabs` is not defined or provided, we cannot determine the exact values that `tabs[i - 1]` holds. But we can still describe the impact of the code on the variables `e` and `s`.

Given that `i` is 1 and `b` is 2, `i - 1` would be 0, which means `tabs[0]` is being referenced. The code checks if `tabs[0]` is equal to 1 and adds 1 to `e` if it is true, and checks if `tabs[0]` is equal to -1 and adds 1 to `s` if it is true. 

Since the value of `tabs[0]` is not specified, we can only express the changes in terms of logical conditions. Let's assume `tabs[0]` can either be 1, -1, or neither (0 or any other value).

- If `tabs[0]` is 1, then `e += 1`.
- If `tabs[0]` is -1, then `s += 1`.

Given no specific value for `tabs[0]` is provided, we can only say that `e` and `s` might change depending on the value of `tabs[0]`.

Output State: **e is 0 or 1, s is 0 or 1, b is 2, max_diff is 0, n is at least 1, i is 2 (after the increment)**

Note: The variable `i` is incremented by 1 after the code block, making `i` equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged unless their values are explicitly updated within the provided code snippet.
