The function accepts a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, and two integers \( n \) and \( k \) such that \( 2 \leq k < n \leq 100 \). It calculates and returns the maximum absolute difference between the counts of 1s and -1s among the segments defined by \((i - b) \% k \neq 0\) for all \( b \) from 1 to \( n \). The function iterates over all possible values of \( b \) from 1 to \( n \), maintaining counters \( e \) and \( s \) for the counts of 1s and -1s respectively, within the specified segments. The maximum absolute difference found during these iterations is stored in the variable `max_diff`, which is printed at the end.
