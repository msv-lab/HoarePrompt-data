Reasoning:
- The function attempts to verify if the input grid can be considered a valid flag of Berland by checking both row-wise and column-wise divisions.
- The function uses the `n // 3` approach to split the grid into three horizontal or vertical stripes and checks if each stripe contains exactly one unique color.
- However, the current implementation has a logical error. Specifically, the code is trying to create sets from generators in the `rows` and `cols` variables, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to use a list of strings to represent each stripe and then check the uniqueness of colors within those stripes.
- Additionally, the function should ensure that the dimensions `n` and `m` are divisible by 3 before proceeding with the checks.

Given the logic in the provided code, it does not correctly implement the required checks for the problem statement. The correct solution should involve dividing the grid into 3 horizontal or vertical stripes and ensuring each stripe has exactly one unique color.

Correctness: **False**
