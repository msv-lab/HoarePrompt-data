You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The flag of Berland is such rectangular field n × m that satisfies following conditions:

  Flag consists of three colors which correspond to letters 'R', 'G' and 'B'.  Flag consists of three equal in width and height stripes, parralel to each other and to sides of the flag. Each stripe has exactly one color.  Each color should be used in exactly one stripe. 

You are given a field n × m, consisting of characters 'R', 'G' and 'B'. Output "YES" (without quotes) if this field corresponds to correct flag of Berland. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the sizes of the field.

Each of the following n lines consisting of m characters 'R', 'G' and 'B' — the description of the field.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if the given field corresponds to correct flag of Berland . Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

The field in the third example doesn't have three parralel stripes.

Rows of the field in the fourth example are parralel to each other and to borders. But they have different heights — 2, 1 and 1.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    field = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    rows = len(set((''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3))))
    cols = len((set(''.join((row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field))) for i in range(3)))
    print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two space-separated integers n and m on the first line, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. Following n lines contain m characters each, which can be 'R', 'G', or 'B'.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

field = [input() for _ in range(n)]

rows = len(set(''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3)))

cols = len(set(''.join(row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field)) for
    i in range(3))

print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\)) followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each, which can be 'R', 'G', or 'B'. It then processes these inputs to check if the grid can be divided into 3x3 sub-grids such that each sub-grid contains exactly one 'R', one 'G', and one 'B'. If such a division is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` are not divisible by 3.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly verify if the flag has three parallel stripes of equal height and width, each containing a unique color ('R', 'G', 'B'). Here are some specific issues:

1. **Stripe Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the number of unique stripes using `rows` and `cols`. However, it incorrectly calculates the number of unique stripes by joining rows and columns in a way that does not ensure the stripes are parallel and of equal height.

2. **Stripe Parallelism**: The program does not explicitly check if the stripes are parallel to each other. It only checks the number of unique characters in the joined strings, which is insufficient to determine if the stripes are parallel and of equal height.

3. **Equal Stripe Height and Width**: The program does not ensure that each stripe has the same height and width. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   6 7
   RRRGGGG
   RRRGGGG
   RRRGGGG
   RRRBBBB
   RRRBBBB
   RRRBBBB
   ```
   This input should output "NO" because the stripes are not of equal width (the first three stripes are wider than the last one). However, the program would output "YES" because it does not check the width of the stripes.

To correct the program, you need to explicitly check the following:
- Each stripe must have the same height.
- Each stripe must have the same width.
- There must be exactly three stripes, each containing one unique color.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    field = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Check if the field has three parallel stripes of equal height and width
    if n % 3 != 0 or m % 3 != 0:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    stripe_height = n // 3
    stripe_width = m // 3
    
    # Check the first stripe
    stripe1 = set(field[i][:stripe_width] for i in range(stripe_height))
    if len(stripe1) != 1:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    # Check the second stripe
    stripe2 = set(field[i][:stripe_width] for i in range(stripe_height, 2*stripe_height))
    if len(stripe2) != 1 or stripe2 == stripe1:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    # Check the third stripe
    stripe3 = set(field[i][:stripe_width] for i in range(2*stripe_height, n))
    if len(stripe3) != 1 or stripe3 == stripe1 or stripe3 == stripe2:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    print("YES")

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the stripes are parallel, of equal height and width, and contain unique colors.
