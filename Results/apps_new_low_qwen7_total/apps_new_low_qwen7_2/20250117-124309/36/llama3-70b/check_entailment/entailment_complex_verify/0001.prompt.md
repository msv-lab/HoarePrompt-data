You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The flag of Berland is such rectangular field n × m that satisfies following conditions:

  Flag consists of three colors which correspond to letters 'R', 'G' and 'B'.  Flag consists of three equal in width and height stripes, parralel to each other and to sides of the flag. Each stripe has exactly one color.  Each color should be used in exactly one stripe. 

You are given a field n × m, consisting of characters 'R', 'G' and 'B'. Output "YES" (without quotes) if this field corresponds to correct flag of Berland. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the sizes of the field.

Each of the following n lines consisting of m characters 'R', 'G' and 'B' — the description of the field.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if the given field corresponds to correct flag of Berland . Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

-----Note-----

The field in the third example doesn't have three parralel stripes.

Rows of the field in the fourth example are parralel to each other and to borders. But they have different heights — 2, 1 and 1.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    field = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    rows = len(set((''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3))))
    cols = len((set(''.join((row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field))) for i in range(3)))
    print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two space-separated integers n and m on the first line, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. Following n lines contain m characters each, which can be 'R', 'G', or 'B'.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

field = [input() for _ in range(n)]

rows = len(set(''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3)))

cols = len(set(''.join(row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field)) for
    i in range(3))

print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\)) followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each, which can be 'R', 'G', or 'B'. It then processes these inputs to check if the grid can be divided into 3x3 sub-grids such that each sub-grid contains exactly one 'R', one 'G', and one 'B'. If such a division is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` are not divisible by 3.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program needs to check if the input field can be divided into three parallel stripes of equal width and height.
2. It checks both the row-wise and column-wise division to ensure each stripe is of one color and each color appears exactly once.
3. The program uses slicing and set operations to extract and analyze stripes.
   - For rows: It slices the field into n//3 chunks vertically.
   - For columns: It slices the field into 3 chunks horizontally.
4. The logic to count unique stripes ensures that there are exactly three unique stripes, each with a single color.
5. The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

Given the above points, the program seems to correctly implement the requirements for checking the flag's validity.

Correctness: **True**
