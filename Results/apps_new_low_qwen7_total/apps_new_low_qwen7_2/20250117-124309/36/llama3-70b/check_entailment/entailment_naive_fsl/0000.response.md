Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly verify if the flag has three parallel stripes of equal height and width, each containing a unique color ('R', 'G', 'B'). Here are some specific issues:

1. **Stripe Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the number of unique stripes using `rows` and `cols`. However, it incorrectly calculates the number of unique stripes by joining rows and columns in a way that does not ensure the stripes are parallel and of equal height.

2. **Stripe Parallelism**: The program does not explicitly check if the stripes are parallel to each other. It only checks the number of unique characters in the joined strings, which is insufficient to determine if the stripes are parallel and of equal height.

3. **Equal Stripe Height and Width**: The program does not ensure that each stripe has the same height and width. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   6 7
   RRRGGGG
   RRRGGGG
   RRRGGGG
   RRRBBBB
   RRRBBBB
   RRRBBBB
   ```
   This input should output "NO" because the stripes are not of equal width (the first three stripes are wider than the last one). However, the program would output "YES" because it does not check the width of the stripes.

To correct the program, you need to explicitly check the following:
- Each stripe must have the same height.
- Each stripe must have the same width.
- There must be exactly three stripes, each containing one unique color.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    field = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Check if the field has three parallel stripes of equal height and width
    if n % 3 != 0 or m % 3 != 0:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    stripe_height = n // 3
    stripe_width = m // 3
    
    # Check the first stripe
    stripe1 = set(field[i][:stripe_width] for i in range(stripe_height))
    if len(stripe1) != 1:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    # Check the second stripe
    stripe2 = set(field[i][:stripe_width] for i in range(stripe_height, 2*stripe_height))
    if len(stripe2) != 1 or stripe2 == stripe1:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    # Check the third stripe
    stripe3 = set(field[i][:stripe_width] for i in range(2*stripe_height, n))
    if len(stripe3) != 1 or stripe3 == stripe1 or stripe3 == stripe2:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    print("YES")

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the stripes are parallel, of equal height and width, and contain unique colors.
