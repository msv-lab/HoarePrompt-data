### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the annotated code step-by-step to validate the original assessment.

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Field:**
   ```python
   (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
   field = [input() for _ in range(n)]
   ```
   - Correctly reads the dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - Initializes the field as a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the field.

2. **Checking Rows:**
   ```python
   rows = len(set(''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3)))
   ```
   - Slices the field into `n // 3` chunks vertically (rows).
   - Joins each chunk into a single string.
   - Converts these strings into a set to get unique vertical stripes.
   - The length of this set should be 3 to ensure there are exactly three unique vertical stripes.

3. **Checking Columns:**
   ```python
   cols = len(set(''.join(row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field))
               for i in range(3))
   ```
   - Slices the field into 3 chunks horizontally (columns).
   - Joins each chunk into a single string.
   - Converts these strings into a set to get unique horizontal stripes.
   - The length of this set should be 3 to ensure there are exactly three unique horizontal stripes.

4. **Final Check and Output:**
   ```python
   print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')
   ```
   - Prints "YES" if both sets have exactly 3 elements (indicating three unique stripes each with a single color).
   - Prints "NO" otherwise.

However, there are some issues with the logic:

- **Vertical Stripe Calculation:**
  - The vertical stripes are calculated using `field[i::n // 3]`, which means every `(n // 3)`th row is taken.
  - This will only work correctly if `n` is divisible by 3. If not, it may lead to incorrect results.

- **Horizontal Stripe Calculation:**
  - The horizontal stripes are calculated using `row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3]`, which means every `(m // 3)`th column is taken.
  - This will only work correctly if `m` is divisible by 3. If not, it may lead to incorrect results.

### Example Analysis:

1. **Example 1:**
   ```plaintext
   6 5
   RRRRR
   RRRRR
   BBBBB
   BBBBB
   GGGGG
   GGGGG
   ```
   - Vertical stripes: `RRRRR`, `BBBBB`, `GGGGG` (3 unique stripes).
   - Horizontal stripes: `RRRRR`, `BBBBB`, `GGGGG` (3 unique stripes).

2. **Example 2:**
   ```plaintext
   4 3
   BRG
   BRG
   BRG
   BRG
   ```
   - Vertical stripes: `B`, `R`, `G` (3 unique stripes).
   - Horizontal stripes: `BRG` (1 unique stripe).

3. **Example 3:**
   ```plaintext
   6 7
   RRRGGGG
   RRRGGGG
   RRRGGGG
   RRRBBBB
   RRRBBBB
   RRRBBBB
   ```
   - Vertical stripes: `RRRGGGG`, `RRRGGGG`, `RRRGGGG` (not 3 unique stripes).
   - Horizontal stripes: `RRRGGGG`, `RRRGGGG`, `RRRGGGG` (not 3 unique stripes).

4. **Example 4:**
   ```plaintext
   4 4
   RRRR
   RRRR
   BBBB
   GGGG
   ```
   - Vertical stripes: `RRRR`, `RRRR`, `BBBB` (3 unique stripes).
   - Horizontal stripes: `RRRR`, `RRRR`, `BBBB` (3 unique stripes).

### Conclusion:

While the code does attempt to solve the problem, it fails in cases where `n` or `m` are not divisible by 3. The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the code will always work correctly regardless of the dimensions of the input field. Therefore, the code is not robust enough to handle all edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
