Reasoning:
1. The program needs to check if the input field can be divided into three parallel stripes of equal width and height.
2. It checks both the row-wise and column-wise division to ensure each stripe is of one color and each color appears exactly once.
3. The program uses slicing and set operations to extract and analyze stripes.
   - For rows: It slices the field into n//3 chunks vertically.
   - For columns: It slices the field into 3 chunks horizontally.
4. The logic to count unique stripes ensures that there are exactly three unique stripes, each with a single color.
5. The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

Given the above points, the program seems to correctly implement the requirements for checking the flag's validity.

Correctness: **True**
