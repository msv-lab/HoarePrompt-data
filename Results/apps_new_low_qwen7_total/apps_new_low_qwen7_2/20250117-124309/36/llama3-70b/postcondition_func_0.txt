The function reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\)) followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each, which can be 'R', 'G', or 'B'. It then processes these inputs to check if the grid can be divided into 3x3 sub-grids such that each sub-grid contains exactly one 'R', one 'G', and one 'B'. If such a division is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` are not divisible by 3.
