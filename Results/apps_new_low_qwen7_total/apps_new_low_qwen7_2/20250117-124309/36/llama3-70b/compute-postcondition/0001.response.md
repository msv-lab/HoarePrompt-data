The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user, specifically two space-separated integers `n` and `m` on the first line, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\). Following these, it reads \(n\) lines, each containing `m` characters that can be 'R', 'G', or 'B'. Based on this input, the function's output is not specified in the given information. Therefore, we can only describe the input part of the function.

Functionality: **The function reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\)) followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each ('R', 'G', or 'B'), and returns unspecified output based on this input.**
