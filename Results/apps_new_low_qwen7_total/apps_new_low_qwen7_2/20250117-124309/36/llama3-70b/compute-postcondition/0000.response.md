To solve this problem, we need to simulate the execution of the given Python code snippet. Let's break down the code and determine its effects on the variables and the overall state.

### Initial State
- The input consists of two space-separated integers `n` and `m` on the first line, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).
- Following `n` lines contain `m` characters each, which can be 'R', 'G', or 'B'.

### Code Analysis
1. **Line 1**: `n, m = map(int, input().split())`
   - This line reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` from the input and converts them to integers. Let's assume `n = 3` and `m = 3` for simplicity (since \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\)).
   - After this line, `n` and `m` are both set to their respective integer values.

2. **Line 2**: `field = [input() for _ in range(n)]`
   - This line reads `n` lines of input and stores each line as an element in the list `field`.
   - For `n = 3`, the input might look like:
     ```
     RGB
     GBR
     BRG
     ```
   - After this line, `field` is a list of strings: `['RGB', 'GBR', 'BRG']`.

3. **Line 3**: `rows = len(set(''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3)))`
   - This line calculates the number of unique rows when the matrix is divided into 3x3 sub-matrices.
   - Here, `n // 3` is 1, so it creates one sub-matrix and checks for uniqueness.
   - `field[0::1]` gives `['RGB']`, `field[1::1]` gives `['GBR']`, and `field[2::1]` gives `['BRG']`.
   - `''.join(['RGB', 'GBR', 'BRG'])` results in `'RGBGBRBRG'`.
   - `set('RGBGBRBRG')` gives `{'RGB', 'GBR', 'BRG'}`.
   - `len({'RGB', 'GBR', 'BRG'})` is 3.
   - So, `rows` is 3.

4. **Line 4**: `cols = len(set(''.join(row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field)) for i in range(3))`
   - This line calculates the number of unique columns when the matrix is divided into 3x3 sub-matrices.
   - Here, `m // 3` is 1, so it creates one sub-matrix and checks for uniqueness.
   - For `i = 0`, `row[0 * 1:(0 + 1) * 1]` for each row in `field` gives `['R', 'G', 'B']`, `['G', 'B', 'R']`, and `['B', 'R', 'G']`.
   - `''.join(['R', 'G', 'B'])` results in `'RGB'`, `''.join(['G', 'B', 'R'])` results in `'GBR'`, and `''.join(['B', 'R', 'G'])` results in `'BRG'`.
   - `set(['RGB', 'GBR', 'BRG'])` gives `{'RGB', 'GBR', 'BRG'}`.
   - For `i = 1`, the process repeats, resulting in the same set.
   - For `i = 2`, the process repeats, resulting in the same set.
   - `len({{'RGB', 'GBR', 'BRG'}, {'RGB', 'GBR', 'BRG'}, {'RGB', 'GBR', 'BRG'}})` is 3.
   - So, `cols` is 3.

5. **Line 5**: `print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')`
   - This line prints 'YES' if `rows` and `cols` are both 3, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
   - Since `rows` and `cols` are both 3, the output is 'YES'.

### Final Output State
- The final values of the variables are:
  - `n` and `m` are set to the integer values from the input.
  - `field` is a list of strings representing the input grid.
  - `rows` is 3.
  - `cols` is 3.

The output of the program is 'YES'.

**Output State: **n is 3, m is 3, field is ['RGB', 'GBR', 'BRG'], rows is 3, cols is 3**
