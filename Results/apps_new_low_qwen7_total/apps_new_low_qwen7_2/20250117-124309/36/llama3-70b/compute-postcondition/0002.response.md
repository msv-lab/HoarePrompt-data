Functionality: **The function reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\)) followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each, which can be 'R', 'G', or 'B'. It then processes these inputs to check if the grid can be divided into 3x3 sub-grids such that each sub-grid contains exactly one 'R', one 'G', and one 'B'. If such a division is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` are not divisible by 3.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that both `n` and `m` are divisible by 3. If either `n` or `m` is not divisible by 3, the function will raise an error when trying to create sub-grids.
- The function does not validate if the total number of 'R', 'G', and 'B' characters is exactly 9 in each 3x3 sub-grid. It only checks the existence of these characters in the specified sub-grids.
- The function does not account for the possibility of having more than three of any character in the entire grid, which would still allow for a valid 3x3 sub-grid configuration.
