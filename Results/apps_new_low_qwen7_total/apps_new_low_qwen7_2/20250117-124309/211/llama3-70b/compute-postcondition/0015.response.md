Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `i` is 3, `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2], `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 1. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then the postcondition remains as specified in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change if the if condition is not met.***
