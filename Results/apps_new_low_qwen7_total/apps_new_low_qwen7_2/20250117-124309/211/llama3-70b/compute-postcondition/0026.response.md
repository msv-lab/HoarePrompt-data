Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers specified by an integer `n` on the first line and the list elements on the next line. It computes the prefix sum of the input list and checks if the last element of the prefix sum array is zero. If it is zero, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it finds the smallest subarray whose sum is non-zero and prints the indices of its start and end along with its length. The function returns nothing, but prints the results to the console. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list where all elements sum to zero.**
