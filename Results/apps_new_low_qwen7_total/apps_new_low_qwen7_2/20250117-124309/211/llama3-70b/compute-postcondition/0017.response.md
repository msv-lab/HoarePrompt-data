The first line of the code prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. Given the initial state, this will print `2 1 2`.

The second line increments `k` by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3.

The third line sets `l` to the value of `r`, which was initially 1. After the increment in the second line, `r` becomes 3. Therefore, `l` is updated to 3.

Combining these changes with the initial state and the printed values, the final state is as follows:
- `total` remains unspecified
- `i` is 3
- `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2]
- `k` is 3
- `l` is 3
- `r` is 2

Output State: **total is unspecified, i is 3, prefix_sum is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2], k is 3, l is 3, r is 2**
