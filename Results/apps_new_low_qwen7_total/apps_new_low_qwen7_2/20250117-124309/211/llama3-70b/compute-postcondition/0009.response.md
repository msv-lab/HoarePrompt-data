The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. It does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is 4, `i` is 3, `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2], and the current value of `prefix_sum[n]` is 0**
