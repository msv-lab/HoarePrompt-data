Output State: **total is unspecified, i is 4, prefix_sum is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2], k is 4, l is 3, r is 3**

Explanation:
1. The first line `print(k, l, r)` prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` which are 3, 3, and 3 respectively.
2. The second line `k += 1` increments `k` by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4.
3. The third line `l = r` assigns the value of `r` (which is 3) to `l`, so `l` also becomes 3.

All other variables (`total` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The `prefix_sum` list stays the same as well.
