The code `prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]` updates the value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]`. However, the variable `a` is not defined in the given initial state, and there is no declaration or initialization of `prefix_sum` before this line of code. Given the lack of information about `a` and `prefix_sum`, we cannot determine the exact updated value for `prefix_sum[i + 1]`. But we know that `i` is 0, so `prefix_sum[i + 1]` translates to `prefix_sum[1]`.

Since the initial state does not include `prefix_sum` or `a`, we can only state that `prefix_sum[1]` is being updated, but its specific value cannot be determined without additional information.

Output State: **`n` is 4, `i` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is updated (but its specific value is unknown)**
