Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the for loop**: The for loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, where `r` is the loop variable.

2. **Understand the initial state**: 
   - `n` is 4.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prefix_sum` is `[0, 1, -1, 2, -2]`.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `l` is 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will start executing when `r` is in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Since `n` is 4, the loop will iterate from `r = 1` to `r = 5`.

4. **Check the first iteration**: For the first iteration, `r` will be 1.

5. **State the necessary conditions for the first iteration**:
   - The value of `r` must be within the specified range (1 to 5).
   - There are no other specific conditions mentioned for the variables `i`, `prefix_sum`, `k`, and `l` that affect the loop execution based on the given code snippet.

Therefore, the state of the objects at the start of the first iteration of the loop must satisfy:
- `r` should be 1 (the starting value of the range).

Since no other variables need to be adjusted specifically for the loop to execute the first time, the key adjustment needed is for `r` to be set to 1.

State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 3, `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2], `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` must be 1**
