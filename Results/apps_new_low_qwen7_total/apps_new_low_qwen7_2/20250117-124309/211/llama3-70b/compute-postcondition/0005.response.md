Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i` and the range is specified as `range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is 4
   - `i` is 1
   - `prefix_sum[2]` is `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]`

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Given `n` is 4, the loop will continue if `i < 4`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - There is no information provided about how `prefix_sum` is updated, but we know that `prefix_sum[2]` was set based on `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]`. For the next iteration, we don't have enough information to update `prefix_sum[2]` directly, but we can infer that `i` will be 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is 4, `i` is 2**
