In the given code snippet, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is assigned the value of `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`. We know that at the start of this iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, we need to determine the value of `prefix_sum[2]` based on the previous value of `prefix_sum[1]` and the value of `a[1]`.

Let's summarize the known values before executing the code:
- `n` is 4.
- `i` is 1.
- `prefix_sum[1]` is updated but its specific value is unknown.

Since the value of `a[1]` is not provided, we will keep it as `a[1]` in our calculation. The code updates `prefix_sum[2]` as follows:
- `prefix_sum[2] = prefix_sum[1] + a[1]`.

Thus, the updated state after the code is executed is:
- `n` is still 4.
- `i` is now 1.
- `prefix_sum[2]` is updated to be `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is 4, `i` is 1, `prefix_sum[2]` is `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]`**
