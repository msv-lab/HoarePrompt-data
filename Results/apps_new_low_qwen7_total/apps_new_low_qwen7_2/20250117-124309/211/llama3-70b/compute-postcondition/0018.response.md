Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `i` is 3, `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2], `k` is 3, `l` is 3, `r` is 2. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and does not equal `prefix_sum[n]`, then the condition holds. Otherwise, the condition does not hold (since there is no else part).*** 

Note: The variable `n` is not defined in the provided information, so it's assumed that `n` refers to `r` for the purpose of this postcondition. If `n` has a different meaning, further clarification would be needed.
