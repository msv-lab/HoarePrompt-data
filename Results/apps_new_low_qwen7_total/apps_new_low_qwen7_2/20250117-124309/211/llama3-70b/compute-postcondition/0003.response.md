Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is 4.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `prefix_sum[1]` is updated but its specific value is unknown.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`. Since `n` is 4 and `i` is 0, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4.

4. **Update the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged at 4.
   - The state of `prefix_sum[1]` is updated but its specific value is unknown, so we keep it as is.

5. **Construct the New State**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` is still 4.
   - `prefix_sum[1]` is updated (specific value unknown).

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `n` is 4, `i` is 1, `prefix_sum[1]` is updated (but its specific value is unknown)**
