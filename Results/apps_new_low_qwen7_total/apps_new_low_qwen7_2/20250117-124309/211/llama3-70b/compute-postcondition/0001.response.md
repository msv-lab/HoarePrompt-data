Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `n` is given as 4.
   - `i` starts from 0 in a `range(n)` loop (where `n` is inclusive).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `n` is 4, `i` must be 0 initially for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 and `n` remains 4 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is 4, `i` is 0**
