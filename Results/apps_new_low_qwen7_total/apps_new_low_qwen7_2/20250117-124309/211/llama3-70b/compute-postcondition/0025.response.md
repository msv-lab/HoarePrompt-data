The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of integers. The list is defined across multiple lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array, and the next line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3) representing the elements of the array.

Given the output cases are not explicitly provided, we will structure the functionality based on typical array processing tasks. However, since no specific output cases are given, we will consider a general case where the function might process the array and return a value based on certain conditions or computations.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers, where the list size is specified by an integer `n` on the first line and the list elements are provided on the next line. It processes the array and returns a value based on certain conditions or computations.**
