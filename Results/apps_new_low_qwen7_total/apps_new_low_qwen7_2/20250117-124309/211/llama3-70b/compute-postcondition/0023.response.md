The code `print(k, l, n)` simply prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `n`. These values are not stored in any new variables, so the variables themselves do not change. The output of the print statement is `3 2 4`, but this does not affect the values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is 4, `i` is 3, `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2], `k` is 3, `l` is 2, `r` is 4**
