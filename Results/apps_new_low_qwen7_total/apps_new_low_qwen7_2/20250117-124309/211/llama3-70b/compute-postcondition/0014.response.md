The initial state is as follows:
- `total` is unspecified
- `i` is 3
- `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2]
- `k` is 1
- `l` is 1
- `r` is 1
- The current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]` (though `n` is not defined in the initial state, we can infer that it should refer to `r` since `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0)

The code snippet executes as follows:
1. `print(k, l, r)` - This prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` which are 1, 1, and 1 respectively.
2. `k += 1` - This increments `k` by 1, so `k` becomes 2.
3. `l = r` - This assigns the value of `r` (which is 1) to `l`, so `l` also becomes 1.

After executing the code, the values of `k` and `l` have changed, while `r` remains unchanged. The other variables (`total`, `i`, and `prefix_sum`) are not affected by the code. 

Output State: **total is unspecified, i is 3, prefix_sum is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2], k is 2, l is 1, r is 1**
