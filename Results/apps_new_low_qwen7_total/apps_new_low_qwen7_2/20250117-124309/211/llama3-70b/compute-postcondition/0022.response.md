Let's analyze the given loop and the provided information step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over `r` from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Inside the loop, it checks if `prefix_sum[r]` is neither 0 nor equal to `prefix_sum[n]`. If this condition is met, it prints `k`, `l`, and `r`, increments `k` by 1, and sets `l` to `r`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **`n`**: This variable is initially set to 4 and does not change within the loop.
- **`i`**: This variable is initially set to 3 and does not change within the loop.
- **`prefix_sum`**: This list does not change within the loop; its values are [0, 1, -1, 2, -2].
- **`k`**: This variable starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time the if condition is satisfied.
- **`l`**: This variable is set to `r` each time the if condition is satisfied.
- **`r`**: This variable iterates through the range from 1 to `n`.

### Step 3: Determine the Final Values
We need to check the values of `prefix_sum[r]` for `r` from 1 to 4:
- For `r = 1`: `prefix_sum[1] = 1` (not 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[4] = -2`), so the condition is satisfied.
- For `r = 2`: `prefix_sum[2] = -1` (not 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[4] = -2`), so the condition is satisfied.
- For `r = 3`: `prefix_sum[3] = 2` (not 0 but equal to `prefix_sum[4] = -2`), so the condition is not satisfied.
- For `r = 4`: `prefix_sum[4] = -2` (0), so the condition is not satisfied.

Therefore, the loop will execute twice, with `r` being 1 and 2.

### Step 4: Calculate the Final Values
- `k` will be incremented twice, starting from 1, so `k` will be 3.
- `l` will be set to `r` when `r` is 1 and 2, so `l` will be 2.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `prefix_sum`, and `r` will remain as they were initially or last iterated over.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`n` is 4, `i` is 3, `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2], `k` is 3, `l` is 2, `r` is 4.**
