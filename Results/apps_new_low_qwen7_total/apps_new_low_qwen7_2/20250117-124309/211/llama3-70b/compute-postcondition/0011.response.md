Output State: **n is 4, i is 3, prefix_sum is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2], k is 1, l is 1**

Explanation:
- The first line `print('YES')` does not modify any variables but prints 'YES' to the console.
- The second line `k = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `k`.
- The third line `l = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `l`.

No other variables are modified, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
