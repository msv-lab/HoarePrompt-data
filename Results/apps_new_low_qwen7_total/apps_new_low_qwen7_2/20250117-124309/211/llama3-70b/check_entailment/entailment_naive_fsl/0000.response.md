Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program fails to handle cases where the array contains consecutive elements that sum to zero, even though the overall sum of the array is not zero. This violates the requirement that each subarray's sum must be non-zero.

For example, consider the input:
```
Input:
6
1 -1 1 -1 1 -1
```
The program will output:
```
YES
2
1 1
2 6
```
However, the subarray `[1 -1]` has a sum of `0`, which is not allowed. The correct output should either be `NO` or split the array into individual elements to ensure no subarray has a sum of `0`.

To fix this, the program needs to check for consecutive elements that sum to zero within the loop and adjust the indices accordingly.
