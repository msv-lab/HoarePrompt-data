Reasoning:
The provided program aims to split the input array into subarrays such that the sum of elements in each subarray is non-zero and these subarrays, when concatenated, form the original array. Here's the analysis:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the input array.
2. **Check for Zero Sum**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the entire array is zero. If it is, it immediately outputs 'NO', indicating that no valid split exists.
3. **Finding Subarrays**: The program iterates through the prefix sums to find the smallest subarray starting from index 1 that has a non-zero sum. It then continues to find subsequent subarrays by ensuring each new subarray starts where the previous one ended.
4. **Output Format**: The program outputs the indices and lengths of the subarrays in the required format.

The execution summary accurately describes the functionality of the program, and the program correctly handles all given examples and potential edge cases. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
