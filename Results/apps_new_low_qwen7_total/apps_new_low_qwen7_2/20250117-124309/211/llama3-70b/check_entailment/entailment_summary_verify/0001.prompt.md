You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers specified by an integer `n` on the first line and the list elements on the next line. It computes the prefix sum of the input list and checks if the last element of the prefix sum array is zero. If it is zero, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it finds the smallest subarray whose sum is non-zero and prints the indices of its start and end along with its length. The function returns nothing, but prints the results to the console. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list where all elements sum to zero.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to split the array \(A\) into segments such that the sum of elements in each segment is non-zero and these segments can be concatenated to form the original array \(A\).

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the array \(A\), storing them in `prefix_sum`. This helps in determining the cumulative sum up to each index.
2. **Check for Zero Total Sum**: The program checks if the total sum of the array (i.e., `prefix_sum[n]`) is zero. If it is, it outputs "NO", indicating that no valid split exists since the entire array's sum must be non-zero.
3. **Splitting Logic**: The logic inside the loop is to find segments where the prefix sums indicate non-zero segments. It starts from the beginning of the array and iterates through it. When a segment sum is non-zero and different from the total sum, it indicates a valid segment. The program prints the start (`l`) and end (`r`) indices of these segments.

### Verification:

- The program correctly handles cases where the entire array sum is zero, outputting "NO".
- For cases where the array can be split into valid segments, the program correctly identifies and prints these segments.

However, there are some potential edge cases and improvements that could ensure the solution is robust:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: Ensure that the program correctly handles cases where the array has all positive or all negative values but still needs to be split into segments.
2. **Multiple Valid Solutions**: The program might miss out on other valid splits, though it does cover the basic requirement of splitting into non-zero sum segments.

Given the problem statement and the provided test cases, the program seems to meet the requirements.
