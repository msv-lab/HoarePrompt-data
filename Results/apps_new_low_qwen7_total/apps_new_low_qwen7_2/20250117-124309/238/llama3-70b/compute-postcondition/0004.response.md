The code prints the minimum value between `m // n + 1` and `m - (n - k)`. Since the print statement does not assign a value to any variable but rather outputs it, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The output is calculated based on the given expressions.

Given the constraints:
- \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 10^9\)
- \(1 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k \neq 1\)

The output is the result of the expression `min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k))`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the output. However, we can state that the output is the minimum of the two values `m // n + 1` and `m - (n - k)`.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, and the output is `min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k))`.**
