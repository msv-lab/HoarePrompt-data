The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the standard input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, the input values must satisfy these constraints.

After executing this line, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated to the input values, but the constraints still apply. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n`, `m`, and `k` are now the input values that satisfy the given conditions.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, and they satisfy 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.**
