The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle the constraints where `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that `1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. However, since no specific operation or return value is provided in the output description, we can only state the constraints.
