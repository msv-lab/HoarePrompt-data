You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n hobbits are planning to spend the night at Frodo's house. Frodo has n beds standing in a row and m pillows (n ≤ m). Each hobbit needs a bed and at least one pillow to sleep, however, everyone wants as many pillows as possible. Of course, it's not always possible to share pillows equally, but any hobbit gets hurt if he has at least two pillows less than some of his neighbors have. 

Frodo will sleep on the k-th bed in the row. What is the maximum number of pillows he can have so that every hobbit has at least one pillow, every pillow is given to some hobbit and no one is hurt?


-----Input-----

The only line contain three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of hobbits, the number of pillows and the number of Frodo's bed.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have so that no one is hurt.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 6 2

Output
2

Input
3 10 3

Output
4

Input
3 6 1

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example Frodo can have at most two pillows. In this case, he can give two pillows to the hobbit on the first bed, and one pillow to each of the hobbits on the third and the fourth beds.

In the second example Frodo can take at most four pillows, giving three pillows to each of the others.

In the third example Frodo can take three pillows, giving two pillows to the hobbit in the middle and one pillow to the hobbit on the third bed.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(min(m // n, m - (n - 1)))
    else:
        print(min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k == 1) :
        print(min(m // n, m - (n - 1)))
    else :
        print(min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. If `k` is 1, the output is `min(m // n, m - (n - 1))`. Otherwise, the output is `min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k))`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided solution, we need to analyze the logic step-by-step and ensure it meets the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
- There are `n` hobbits and `m` pillows.
- Each hobbit must get at least one pillow.
- No hobbit should have at least two pillows fewer than their neighbor.
- Frodo sleeps on the `k-th` bed.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The solution uses a conditional statement to handle two cases:
1. When Frodo is on the first bed (`k == 1`).
2. For all other positions (`k > 1`).

#### Case 1: Frodo on the First Bed (`k == 1`)
- The expression `min(m // n, m - (n - 1))` is used.
  - `m // n` calculates the average number of pillows per hobbit.
  - `m - (n - 1)` ensures there are enough pillows for all but the last hobbit.
  - The minimum of these two values is taken to ensure the distribution respects the constraints.

#### Case 2: Frodo on Any Other Bed (`k > 1`)
- The expression `min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k))` is used.
  - `m // n + 1` accounts for Frodo taking one more pillow than the average.
  - `m - (n - k)` ensures there are enough pillows for all but the `k-1` hobbits after Frodo.
  - The minimum of these two values is taken to respect the constraints.

### Edge Cases and Constraints Check:
- The solution handles the edge case where Frodo is on the first bed separately.
- It correctly accounts for the number of pillows Frodo can take while ensuring others get at least one pillow and no one ends up with fewer than two pillows less than their neighbor.

### Correctness Verification:
Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the solution appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required conditions. Let's verify against the given test cases:

1. **Example 1**: `n = 4`, `m = 6`, `k = 2`
   - Frodo takes 2 pillows, distributing 2, 1, 1, 1.
   - The output is correct.

2. **Example 2**: `n = 3`, `m = 10`, `k = 3`
   - Frodo takes 4 pillows, distributing 3, 3, 4.
   - The output is correct.

3. **Example 3**: `n = 3`, `m = 6`, `k = 1`
   - Frodo takes 3 pillows, distributing 3, 2, 1.
   - The output is correct.

Since the solution correctly handles the given examples and edge cases, the provided code meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
