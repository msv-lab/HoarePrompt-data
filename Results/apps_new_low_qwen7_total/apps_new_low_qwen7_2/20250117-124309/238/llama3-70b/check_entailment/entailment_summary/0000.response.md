Reasoning:
1. The problem requires distributing pillows such that each hobbit gets at least one pillow and no hobbit feels "hurt" (i.e., no hobbit should have at least two fewer pillows than another neighboring hobbit).
2. The program correctly handles the edge case when `k` is 1 by calculating the minimum of `m // n` (the integer division of pillows per hobbit) and `m - (n - 1)`, which ensures that Frodo (on the first bed) gets enough pillows while still allowing the rest of the hobbits to get at least one pillow.
3. For other cases, the program calculates the minimum of `m // n + 1` and `m - (n - k)`. This ensures that Frodo gets one more pillow than the average per hobbit, plus an additional pillow if necessary, ensuring that no hobbit ends up with fewer than two fewer pillows than their neighbor.
4. The logic in the program aligns with the requirements of the problem statement. It ensures that the distribution is fair and meets all the conditions specified in the problem.
5. The function correctly processes all given test cases in the examples provided.

Based on the above reasoning:

Correctness: **True**
