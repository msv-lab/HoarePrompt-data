Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
n hobbits are planning to spend the night at Frodo's house. Frodo has n beds standing in a row and m pillows (n ≤ m). Each hobbit needs a bed and at least one pillow to sleep, however, everyone wants as many pillows as possible. Of course, it's not always possible to share pillows equally, but any hobbit gets hurt if he has at least two pillows less than some of his neighbors have. 

Frodo will sleep on the k-th bed in the row. What is the maximum number of pillows he can have so that every hobbit has at least one pillow, every pillow is given to some hobbit and no one is hurt?


-----Input-----

The only line contain three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of hobbits, the number of pillows and the number of Frodo's bed.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have so that no one is hurt.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 6 2

Output
2

Input
3 10 3

Output
4

Input
3 6 1

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example Frodo can have at most two pillows. In this case, he can give two pillows to the hobbit on the first bed, and one pillow to each of the hobbits on the third and the fourth beds.

In the second example Frodo can take at most four pillows, giving three pillows to each of the others.

In the third example Frodo can take three pillows, giving two pillows to the hobbit in the middle and one pillow to the hobbit on the third bed.

# Program:
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(min(m // n, m - (n - 1)))
    else:
        print(min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)))





# Execution Summary:
The function reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the standard input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq m \leq 10^9 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \). It then calculates and prints one of two values based on the value of \( k \):

1. If \( k = 1 \), it prints \( \min\left(\frac{m}{n}, m - (n - 1)\right) \).
2. Otherwise, it prints \( \min\left(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{n} \right\rfloor + 1, m - (n - k)\right) \).

The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After executing the function, the program will have printed one of the two calculated values, depending on the value of \( k \). The function handles all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
