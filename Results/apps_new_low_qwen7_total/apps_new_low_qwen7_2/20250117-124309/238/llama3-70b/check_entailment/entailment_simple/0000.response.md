### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute \(m\) pillows among \(n\) hobbits such that each hobbit gets at least one pillow, and no hobbit is "hurt" (i.e., no hobbit should have at least two fewer pillows than any of their neighbors).
   - Frodo sleeps on the \(k\)-th bed, and we need to find the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have under these conditions.

2. **Key Constraints and Observations:**
   - If Frodo is on the first bed (\(k = 1\)), the worst-case scenario for him is when all other hobbits get more pillows. The optimal distribution would be to maximize Frodoâ€™s pillows while ensuring the condition is met.
   - For \(k > 1\), Frodo can have one more pillow than the average because he is not restricted by the hobbit on the first bed.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code correctly splits the logic into two cases based on whether \(k\) is 1 or not.
   - When \(k = 1\):
     - The formula `min(m // n, m - (n - 1))` calculates the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have by ensuring that the remaining pillows are distributed among the rest of the hobbits such that no one is "hurt."
   - When \(k > 1\):
     - The formula `min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k))` accounts for Frodo having one more pillow than the average, ensuring he does not end up with fewer pillows than his neighbors.

4. **Validation of the Formulas:**
   - The formulas correctly handle the edge cases and ensure that the distribution rules are followed.
   - The conditions in the if-else block cover all scenarios correctly without missing any.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The provided examples demonstrate that the formulas work as expected for various values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).

Given the above analysis, the provided program logic and formulas correctly solve the problem as per the constraints and requirements.

### Correctness: **True**
