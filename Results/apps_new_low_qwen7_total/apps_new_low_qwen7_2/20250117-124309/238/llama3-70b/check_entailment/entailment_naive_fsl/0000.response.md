Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where `k` is equal to `n`. Specifically, when `k == n`, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input
3 6 3

Output
Expected: 3
Actual:   2
```

In this case, if `k == n`, Frodo should get as many pillows as possible without causing any hobbit to have at least two fewer pillows than their neighbors. The correct answer should be 3, as Frodo can have 3 pillows, and the remaining pillows can be distributed as 2 and 1 to the hobbits on the first and second beds, respectively. However, the program prints 2, which is incorrect.
