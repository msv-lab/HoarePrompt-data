The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an even integer `n` and a string `ticket` of length `n` containing digits and '?' characters. The function calculates the sum of non-question mark characters and counts the number of question marks in the first and second halves of the `ticket` string. Based on these calculations, it determines whether the ticket is 'Bicarp' or 'Monocarp' and prints the result to the console.
