You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp and Bicarp live in Berland, where every bus ticket consists of $n$ digits ($n$ is an even number). During the evening walk Monocarp and Bicarp found a ticket where some of the digits have been erased. The number of digits that have been erased is even.

Monocarp and Bicarp have decided to play a game with this ticket. Monocarp hates happy tickets, while Bicarp collects them. A ticket is considered happy if the sum of the first $\frac{n}{2}$ digits of this ticket is equal to the sum of the last $\frac{n}{2}$ digits.

Monocarp and Bicarp take turns (and Monocarp performs the first of them). During each turn, the current player must replace any erased digit with any digit from $0$ to $9$. The game ends when there are no erased digits in the ticket.

If the ticket is happy after all erased digits are replaced with decimal digits, then Bicarp wins. Otherwise, Monocarp wins. You have to determine who will win if both players play optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one even integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5})$ — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains a string of $n$ digits and "?" characters — the ticket which Monocarp and Bicarp have found. If the $i$-th character is "?", then the $i$-th digit is erased. Note that there may be leading zeroes. The number of "?" characters is even.


-----Output-----

If Monocarp wins, print "Monocarp" (without quotes). Otherwise print "Bicarp" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
0523

Output
Bicarp

Input
2
??

Output
Bicarp

Input
8
?054??0?

Output
Bicarp

Input
6
???00?

Output
Monocarp



-----Note-----

Since there is no question mark in the ticket in the first example, the winner is determined before the game even starts, and it is Bicarp.

In the second example, Bicarp also wins. After Monocarp chooses an erased digit and replaces it with a new one, Bicap can choose another position with an erased digit and replace it with the same digit, so the ticket is happy.

    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over the second half of the `ticket` string from index `half_n` to `n - 1`. It updates `right_sum` by adding the integer value of each non-question mark character encountered and increments `right_question_marks` by 1 for each question mark encountered.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `left_sum` and `left_question_marks` remain constant throughout the loop as they are initialized before the loop starts.
    #   - `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` are updated inside the loop based on the current character being processed.
    #   - `half_n` and `n` remain unchanged.
    #   - `ticket` remains unchanged.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop processes each character in the second half of the `ticket` string once. For each character, it either adds its integer value to `right_sum` or increments `right_question_marks` by 1 if the character is a question mark.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: After the loop completes, `right_sum` contains the sum of all non-question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`, and `right_question_marks` contains the count of question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`. These values are consistent with the behavior of the loop and the provided output states.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state after the loop finishes is:
    #Output State: `left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, and `right_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`, `right_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`.
    diff = left_sum - right_sum

q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks
    if ((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0) :
        print('Bicarp')
    else :
        print('Monocarp')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to half_n - 1, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to half_n - 1, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, `right_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index half_n to n - 1, `right_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index half_n to n - 1, `diff` is the difference between `left_sum` and `right_sum`, `q_diff` is the difference between `left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks`. If `(diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0`, then the string 'Bicarp' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the string 'Monocarp' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an even integer `n` and a string `ticket` of length `n` containing digits and '?' characters. The function calculates the sum of non-question mark characters and counts the number of question marks in the first and second halves of the `ticket` string. Based on these calculations, it determines whether the ticket is 'Bicarp' or 'Monocarp' and prints the result to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Monocarp and Bicarp. Specifically, the program calculates whether Bicarp can win immediately without considering the players' optimal moves. Here's why:

1. The program calculates the difference (`diff`) between the sums of the first half and the second half of the ticket and the difference in the number of question marks (`q_diff`).
2. It then checks if `(diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0` to determine if Bicarp can make the ticket happy.
3. However, this approach does not account for the optimal moves of both players. Monocarp can strategically place digits to prevent Bicarp from making the ticket happy, and vice versa.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
6
?00?0?
```
- If Monocarp places a `1` in the first `?`, the ticket becomes `100?0?`.
- Now, Bicarp needs to place a digit in the last `?` such that the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three digits.
- No matter what Bicarp places, Monocarp can always counter it to prevent Bicarp from winning. For example, if Bicarp places a `1`, Monocarp can place a `1` in the last `?`, resulting in `100101`, which is not happy.

The program fails to capture these strategic interactions and simply checks a condition that doesn't reflect the optimal play of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
