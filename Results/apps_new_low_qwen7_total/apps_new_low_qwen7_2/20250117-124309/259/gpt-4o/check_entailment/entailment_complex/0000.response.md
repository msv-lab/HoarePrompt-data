Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Breakdown**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of digits in the ticket) and `ticket` (a string containing digits and '?' characters).
   - It initializes variables to calculate the sums (`left_sum` and `right_sum`) and counts of question marks (`left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks`) in the first and second halves of the ticket, respectively.
   - It correctly iterates through the first and second halves of the ticket to update these variables.
   - After the iterations, it calculates the difference in sums (`diff`) and the difference in the number of question marks (`q_diff`).

2. **Winning Condition Check**:
   - The condition to check if Bicarp wins is derived from the equation `(diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0`.
     - This equation essentially checks if the difference in sums plus the contribution of the question marks (each '?' can be any digit from 0 to 9, contributing up to 9 to the sum) makes the total difference divisible by 9.
     - If the above condition holds true, it means that Bicarp can always balance the sums by replacing the question marks appropriately to make the ticket happy. Otherwise, Monocarp can always make the ticket unhappy.

3. **Optimal Play Analysis**:
   - Since both players play optimally, the key is to ensure that the game's outcome is determined solely by the initial differences and the number of question marks.
   - The logic implemented in the function correctly identifies whether Bicarp can force a win or not.

Given the correct implementation of the logic to determine the winner based on the differences and question marks, the function `func_1` correctly identifies the winner under optimal play conditions.

Correctness: **True**
