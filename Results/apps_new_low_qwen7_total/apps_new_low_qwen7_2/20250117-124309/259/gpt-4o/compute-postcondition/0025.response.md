Postcondition: ***`left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged. If `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'`, then `right_question_marks` is 2 if `ticket[half_n]` was `'?'` before and 1 otherwise, and `right_sum` is 0 if `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'` or the integer value of `ticket[half_n]` if it is not a question mark. If `ticket[half_n]` is not `'?'`, then `i` is `half_n + 2`, `right_sum` is incremented by the integer value of `ticket[half_n + 1]` if `ticket[half_n]` is not `'?'`, and `right_question_marks` is 0 if `ticket[half_n]` is not `'?'`, 1 if `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'`.***
