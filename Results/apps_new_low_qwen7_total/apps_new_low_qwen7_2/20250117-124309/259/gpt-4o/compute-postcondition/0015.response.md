Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step and determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
- The loop iterates over the first half of the `ticket` string (from index 0 to `half_n - 1`).
- For each iteration, it checks if the current character in `ticket` is a question mark ('?'):
  - If `ticket[i]` is '?', `left_question_marks` is incremented by 1.
  - Otherwise, `left_sum` is updated to `left_sum + int(ticket[i])`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: 
  - `half_n` remains constant as it is initialized once and never changes.
- **Variables Updated During Loop**:
  - `left_sum`: Updated based on the integer value of non-question mark characters.
  - `left_question_marks`: Incremented for each question mark character encountered.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop will execute exactly `half_n` times because it runs from `i = 0` to `i = half_n - 1`.
- After the loop, `left_sum` will contain the sum of the integer values of all non-question mark characters from the start of the `ticket` string up to `half_n - 1`.
- `left_question_marks` will contain the count of question mark characters from the start of the `ticket` string up to `half_n - 1`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- The relationships and invariants are consistent with the described iterations. Each iteration updates either `left_sum` or `left_question_marks` based on the current character in `ticket`.

### Final Output State
Since the loop runs `half_n` times, the final values of `left_sum` and `left_question_marks` will be as follows:
- `left_sum`: The sum of all non-question mark characters from the start of the `ticket` string up to `half_n - 1`.
- `left_question_marks`: The count of question mark characters from the start of the `ticket` string up to `half_n - 1`.

Output State: **`left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `n` and `half_n` remain unchanged, `ticket` remains unchanged, and `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` remain 0.**
