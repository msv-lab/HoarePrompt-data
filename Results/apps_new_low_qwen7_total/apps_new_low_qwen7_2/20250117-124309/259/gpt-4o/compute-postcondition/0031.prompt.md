You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet consisting of multiple lines. Your task is to execute all the lines in sequence and provide the output state after the entire code block has been run. Avoid describing how the program runs step-by-step for individual lines but instead focus on the combined effect of all lines. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations.  

Include all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution and update the values of any variables that are modified by the code. Provide the final state in the text format: Output State: **output state**.

Here are some examples to help you understand the task:

Example 1:
Initial State: `a` is 5, `b` is 3
```
c = a + b
d = c * 2
```

Example Answer 1:
The first line assigns the value of `a + b` to `c`. Since `a` is 5 and `b` is 3, `c` becomes 8. The second line assigns the value of `c * 2` to `d`, making `d` equal to 16. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **a is 5, b is 3, c is 8, d is 16**

Example 2:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer
```
n= int(input())
x += n
```

Example Answer 2:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line increments `x` by the value of `n`. The value of `x` is a positive integer, and `n` is an integer. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to its original value plus n , n is an integer**

Example 3:
Initial State: `n` is 3, `total` is 1
```
total += n
pass
n= max(total, n)
```

Example Answer 3:
The first line increments `total` by the value of `n`, making `total` equal to 4. The second line does not affect any variables. The third line assigns the maximum value between `total` and `n` to `n`. Since `total` is 4, and n was 3, `n` becomes 4.
Output State: **n is 4, total is 4**

Your Task:
Initial State: Output State: `left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, and `right_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`, `right_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over the second half of the `ticket` string from index `half_n` to `n - 1`. It updates `right_sum` by adding the integer value of each non-question mark character encountered and increments `right_question_marks` by 1 for each question mark encountered.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `left_sum` and `left_question_marks` remain constant throughout the loop as they are initialized before the loop starts.
   - `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` are updated inside the loop based on the current character being processed.
   - `half_n` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `ticket` remains unchanged.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop processes each character in the second half of the `ticket` string once. For each character, it either adds its integer value to `right_sum` or increments `right_question_marks` by 1 if the character is a question mark.

4. **Verify Relationships**: After the loop completes, `right_sum` contains the sum of all non-question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`, and `right_question_marks` contains the count of question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`. These values are consistent with the behavior of the loop and the provided output states.

Thus, the final output state after the loop finishes is:
Output State: `left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, and `right_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`, `right_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`.
```
diff = left_sum - right_sum
q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks

```

Now, please analyze the entire block of code and provide the final output state. List the impact of all lines on the program, check the previous values of affected variables, and calculate the results. Use the text format: Output State: **output state**. Be as specific as possible, combining changes from all lines into a single coherent final state. Include all valid information from the precondition and update only what is modified by the code.
