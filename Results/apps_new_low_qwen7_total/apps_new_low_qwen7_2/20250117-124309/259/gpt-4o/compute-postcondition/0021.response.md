Postcondition: **`left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, and `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` are as follows: if `ticket[i]` is a question mark (`'?'`), then `right_sum` is 0 and `right_question_marks` is 1; otherwise, `right_sum` is incremented by the integer value of `ticket[i]` and `right_question_marks` remains 0.**
