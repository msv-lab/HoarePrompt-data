Output State: **n is an even integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, ticket is a string of length n containing digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, half_n is n // 2, left_sum is 0, right_sum is 0, left_question_marks is 0, right_question_marks is 0**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates `half_n` by performing integer division of `n` by 2. This value is stored in `half_n`.
- The next three lines initialize `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_question_marks`, and `right_question_marks` to 0. These variables are used to keep track of the sums and counts of question marks in the left and right halves of the `ticket` string, respectively.
- No changes are made to the `ticket` string or the value of `n` itself, so these remain as described in the initial state.
