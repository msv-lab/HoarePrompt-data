Postcondition: ***`left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, `i` is `half_n + 1`. If `ticket[i]` is a question mark, `right_question_marks` is `left_question_marks + 1`. Otherwise, `right_sum` is increased by the integer value of `ticket[half_n + 1]`.***
