Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an even integer `n` and a string `ticket` of length `n` containing digits and '?' characters. The function calculates the sum of non-question mark characters and counts the number of question marks in the first and second halves of the `ticket` string. Based on these calculations, it determines whether the ticket is 'Bicarp' or 'Monocarp' and prints the result to the console.**

**After the function concludes, the state of the program will be as follows:**
- The variable `left_sum` contains the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`.
- The variable `left_question_marks` contains the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`.
- The variable `half_n` is `n // 2` and is unchanged.
- The variable `ticket` remains unchanged.
- The variable `right_sum` contains the sum of all non-question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`.
- The variable `right_question_marks` contains the count of question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`.
- The variables `diff` and `q_diff` are calculated as the differences between `left_sum` and `right_sum`, and `left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks`, respectively.
- The function prints 'Bicarp' if the condition `(diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0` is met; otherwise, it prints 'Monocarp'.

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function assumes that `n` is always an even integer and `ticket` is always a string of length `n`. There are no checks for these assumptions in the code.
- The function does not handle cases where `ticket` might contain invalid characters (characters other than digits and '?'). Such characters would cause an error when converting to integers.
- The function does not validate that the number of '?' characters in the entire `ticket` string is even, which is a requirement mentioned in the initial state description but not enforced by the code.
- The function does not provide a return value; instead, it relies solely on printing the result to the console. This might not be suitable for scenarios where the result needs to be used further in the program.
