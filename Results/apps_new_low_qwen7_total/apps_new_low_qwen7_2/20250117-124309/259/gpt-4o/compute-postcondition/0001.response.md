Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `half_n`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `half_n`.

3. **Initial Values and Requirements**:
   - `n` is an even integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5.
   - `ticket` is a string of length `n` containing digits and '?' characters, with an even number of '?' characters.
   - `half_n = n // 2`.
   - `left_sum` is 0 (the sum of digits on the left side).
   - `right_sum` is 0 (the sum of digits on the right side).
   - `left_question_marks` is 0 (count of '?' on the left side).
   - `right_question_marks` is 0 (count of '?' on the right side).

4. **First Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 0 because the loop starts from `i = 0` and increments by 1.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, we need to ensure that `i < half_n`, which means `half_n` must be greater than 0.

5. **Summary of Conditions**:
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `half_n` must be greater than 0.

Given these conditions, we can summarize the required state for the loop head:

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `half_n` must be greater than 0

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 0, `half_n` must be greater than 0**
