The code snippet increments `right_sum` by converting `ticket[i]` to an integer, where `i` is `half_n + 1`. Given that `half_n` is less than `n`, `i` will be a valid index within the range of the `ticket` string. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since the exact value of `ticket[i]` is not provided, we represent the updated `right_sum` as `right_sum + int(ticket[half_n + 1])`.

Output State: **`left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, `i` is `half_n + 1`, `right_sum` is increased by `int(ticket[half_n + 1])`**
