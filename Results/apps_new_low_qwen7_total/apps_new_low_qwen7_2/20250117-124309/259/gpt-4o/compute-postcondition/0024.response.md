The code snippet `right_sum += int(ticket[i])` increments `right_sum` by the integer value of `ticket[i]`. Given that `i` is `half_n + 1`, we know that `ticket[i]` is a character at the index `half_n + 1`.

From the initial state, `ticket[half_n]` determines the initial value of `right_sum` and `right_question_marks`. If `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'`, then `right_sum` is 0 and `right_question_marks` is 1. Otherwise, `right_sum` is the integer value of `ticket[half_n]` and `right_question_marks` is 0.

After executing the code, `right_sum` will be updated by adding the integer value of `ticket[i]` (which is `ticket[half_n + 1]`).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, `i` is `half_n + 2`, `right_sum` is `right_sum + int(ticket[half_n + 1])` if `ticket[half_n]` is not `'?'`, `0` if `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'`, and `right_question_marks` is `0` if `ticket[half_n]` is not `'?'`, `1` if `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'`.**
