Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables**: The relevant variables in the loop head are `i`, `half_n`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop starts with `i` in the range `range(half_n, n)`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within this range.

3. **Initial values of the variables**:
   - `left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`.
   - `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`.
   - `n` and `half_n` remain unchanged.
   - `ticket` remains unchanged.
   - `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` remain 0.

4. **Condition for the first loop execution**:
   - The loop starts with `i = half_n` and increments `i` until it reaches `n`.
   - Therefore, the smallest possible value for `i` in the first iteration is `half_n`.

5. **Ensure the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `half_n` must be less than `n`.

Given this analysis, the state of the objects in the loop head must satisfy the following conditions for the loop to execute the first time:
- `i` must be `half_n`.
- `half_n` must be less than `n`.

So, the required state for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, and `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` remain 0.**
