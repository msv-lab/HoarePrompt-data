The code `left_sum += int(ticket[i])` increments `left_sum` by the integer value of `ticket[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2 and `half_n` is greater than 0, the only affected variable is `left_sum`. However, the value of `ticket[i]` is not specified in the initial state, so we can't determine the exact new value of `left_sum`. We know that `left_sum` is increased by the integer value of `ticket[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `half_n` is greater than 0; `left_sum` is increased by `int(ticket[2])`**
