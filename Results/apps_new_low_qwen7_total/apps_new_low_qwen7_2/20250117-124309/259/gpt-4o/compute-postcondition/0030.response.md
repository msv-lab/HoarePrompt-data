Output State: `left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, and `right_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`, `right_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over the second half of the `ticket` string from index `half_n` to `n - 1`. It updates `right_sum` by adding the integer value of each non-question mark character encountered and increments `right_question_marks` by 1 for each question mark encountered.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `left_sum` and `left_question_marks` remain constant throughout the loop as they are initialized before the loop starts.
   - `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` are updated inside the loop based on the current character being processed.
   - `half_n` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `ticket` remains unchanged.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop processes each character in the second half of the `ticket` string once. For each character, it either adds its integer value to `right_sum` or increments `right_question_marks` by 1 if the character is a question mark.

4. **Verify Relationships**: After the loop completes, `right_sum` contains the sum of all non-question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`, and `right_question_marks` contains the count of question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`. These values are consistent with the behavior of the loop and the provided output states.

Thus, the final output state after the loop finishes is:
Output State: `left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, and `right_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`, `right_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`.
