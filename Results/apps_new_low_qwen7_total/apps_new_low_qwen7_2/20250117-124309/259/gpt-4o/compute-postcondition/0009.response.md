The code `left_sum += int(ticket[i])` increments `left_sum` by the integer value of `ticket[i]`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `left_sum` or `ticket`, and only mentions that `half_n` is greater than 0. Since `left_sum` is incremented by `int(ticket[i])`, the exact value of `left_sum` depends on the value of `ticket[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `half_n` is greater than 0, `left_sum` is increased by `int(ticket[i])`**
