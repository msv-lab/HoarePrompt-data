The code `left_question_marks += 1` increments the value of `left_question_marks` by 1. The initial state is that `i` is 0, `half_n` is greater than 0, and the value of `ticket[i]` is '?'. The variable `left_question_marks` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified, so we just know it has been incremented.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `half_n` is greater than 0, and the value of `ticket[i]` is '?'; `left_question_marks` is incremented by 1.**
