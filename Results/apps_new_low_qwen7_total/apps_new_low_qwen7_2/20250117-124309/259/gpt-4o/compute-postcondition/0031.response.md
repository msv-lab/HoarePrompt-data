Based on the provided code snippet and explanation, let's break down the execution and determine the final output state.

### Initial State:
- `left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`.
- `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`.
- `half_n` must be less than `n`.
- `ticket` remains unchanged.
- `right_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`.
- `right_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
diff = left_sum - right_sum
q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks
```

### Analysis:
1. **`diff = left_sum - right_sum`**:
   - This line calculates the difference between `left_sum` and `right_sum`.
   - `left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`.
   - `right_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`.
   - The result of this operation is stored in `diff`.

2. **`q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks`**:
   - This line calculates the difference between `left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks`.
   - `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`.
   - `right_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index `half_n` to `n - 1`.
   - The result of this operation is stored in `q_diff`.

### Final Output State:
- `left_sum` remains unchanged.
- `left_question_marks` remains unchanged.
- `half_n` remains unchanged.
- `ticket` remains unchanged.
- `right_sum` remains unchanged.
- `right_question_marks` remains unchanged.
- `diff` is the difference between `left_sum` and `right_sum`.
- `q_diff` is the difference between `left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks`.

### Conclusion:
The variables `left_sum`, `left_question_marks`, `half_n`, `ticket`, `right_sum`, and `right_question_marks` are not modified by the code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state. The new variables `diff` and `q_diff` are introduced and contain the calculated differences.

Output State: **left_sum is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to half_n - 1, left_question_marks is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to half_n - 1, half_n must be less than n, ticket remains unchanged, right_sum is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index half_n to n - 1, right_question_marks is the count of question mark characters from index half_n to n - 1, diff is the difference between left_sum and right_sum, q_diff is the difference between left_question_marks and right_question_marks**.
