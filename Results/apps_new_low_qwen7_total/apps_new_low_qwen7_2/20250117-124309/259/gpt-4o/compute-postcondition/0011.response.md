Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `half_n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < half_n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `half_n` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `half_n` must still be greater than 0. Since it was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` will be 2.
- `half_n` must still be greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2 and `half_n` is greater than 0**
