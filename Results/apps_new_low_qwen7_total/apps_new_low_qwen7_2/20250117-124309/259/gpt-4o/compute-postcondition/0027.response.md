`right_question_marks` is incremented by 1. The value of `left_sum` and `left_question_marks` remains the same as their previous values. The value of `half_n` and `n` remain unchanged, and `ticket` and `i` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, `i` is `half_n + 1`, and `right_question_marks` is one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, `i` is `half_n + 1`, `right_question_marks` is `left_question_marks + 1`**.
