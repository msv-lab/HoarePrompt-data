The code snippet simply prints 'Monocarp', which does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **left_sum is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to half_n - 1, left_question_marks is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to half_n - 1, half_n must be less than n, ticket remains unchanged, right_sum is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index half_n to n - 1, right_question_marks is the count of question mark characters from index half_n to n - 1, diff is the difference between left_sum and right_sum, q_diff is the difference between left_question_marks and right_question_marks, ((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 != 0), 'Monocarp' is printed**
