The code `right_question_marks += 1` increments the value of `right_question_marks` by 1. The initial state specifies that `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` are both 0, so after executing this line of code, `right_question_marks` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, and `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` are 0 and 1 respectively.
