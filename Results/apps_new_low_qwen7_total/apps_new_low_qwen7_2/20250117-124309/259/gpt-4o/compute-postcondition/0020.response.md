The code `right_sum += int(ticket[i])` increments the value of `right_sum` by converting `ticket[i]` to an integer. Since `ticket[i]` is a character (assuming it's part of a string), it needs to be converted to an integer. However, the exact value of `ticket[i]` is not specified in the initial state. We know that `right_sum` was initially 0, and now it will be updated to `right_sum + int(ticket[i])`.

The other variables (`left_sum`, `left_question_marks`, `half_n`, `ticket`, `right_question_marks`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, `right_sum` is `right_sum + int(ticket[i])`, and `right_question_marks` remains 0.**
