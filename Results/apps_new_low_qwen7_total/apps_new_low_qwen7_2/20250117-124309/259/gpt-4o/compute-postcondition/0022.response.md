Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `left_sum`: The sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`.
   - `left_question_marks`: The count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`.
   - `half_n`: Must be less than `n`.
   - `ticket`: Remains unchanged.
   - `right_sum`: If `ticket[i]` is a question mark (`'?'`), then `right_sum` is 0 and `right_question_marks` is 1; otherwise, `right_sum` is incremented by the integer value of `ticket[i]` and `right_question_marks` remains 0.
   - `right_question_marks`: As mentioned above.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `half_n` to `n`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `half_n + 1`.
   - `half_n` will remain the same unless updated within the loop body, but we are not given any information about updates within the loop body.
   - `ticket` remains unchanged.
   - `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` will change based on the current value of `ticket[i]`.

4. **Updating `right_sum` and `right_question_marks`:**
   - If `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'`, then `right_sum` will be 0 and `right_question_marks` will be 1.
   - Otherwise, `right_sum` will be incremented by the integer value of `ticket[half_n]` and `right_question_marks` will remain 0.

5. **New States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `left_sum`: Remains unchanged.
   - `left_question_marks`: Remains unchanged.
   - `half_n`: Remains unchanged.
   - `ticket`: Remains unchanged.
   - `i` will be `half_n + 1`.
   - `right_sum` will be updated based on `ticket[half_n]`.
   - `right_question_marks` will be updated based on `ticket[half_n]`.

Based on this reasoning, the new states for the next iteration are:

State: **`left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, `i` is `half_n + 1`, `right_sum` is 0 if `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'` or the integer value of `ticket[half_n]` if it is not a question mark, and `right_question_marks` is 1 if `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'` or 0 otherwise.**
