`left_sum` is assigned the value of `left_sum + int(ticket[i])`. The value of `i` is 0, so `left_sum` is incremented by the integer value of `ticket[0]`. The state of `half_n` remains unchanged, and `ticket[i]` (which is `ticket[0]`) is not '?'.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `half_n` is greater than 0, `ticket[0]` is not '?', `left_sum` is `left_sum + int(ticket[0])`**
