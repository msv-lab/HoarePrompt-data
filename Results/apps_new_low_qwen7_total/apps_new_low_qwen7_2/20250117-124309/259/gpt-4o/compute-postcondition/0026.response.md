Let's break down the task step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `left_sum`: The sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`.
- `left_question_marks`: The count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`.
- `half_n`: Must be less than `n`.
- `ticket`: Remains unchanged.
- If `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'`:
  - `right_question_marks` is 2 if `ticket[half_n]` was `'?'` before, and 1 otherwise.
  - `right_sum` is 0 if `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'`, or the integer value of `ticket[half_n]` if it is not a question mark.
- If `ticket[half_n]` is not `'?'`:
  - `i` is `half_n + 2`.
  - `right_sum` is incremented by the integer value of `ticket[half_n + 1]`.
  - `right_question_marks` is 0 if `ticket[half_n]` is not `'?'`, and 1 if `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'`.

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(half_n, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- **Variables in the Loop Head**: `i`, `half_n`, and `n`.

### Adjusting States
1. **`i`**:
   - Initially, `i` is set to `half_n` at the start of each iteration.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `half_n + 1`.

2. **`half_n`**:
   - `half_n` does not change within the loop. It is the same for each iteration.

3. **`n`**:
   - `n` does not change within the loop. It is the same for each iteration.

### New State
- `left_sum`: Remains unchanged.
- `left_question_marks`: Remains unchanged.
- `half_n`: Remains unchanged.
- `ticket`: Remains unchanged.
- `i`: Updated to `half_n + 1`.

### Final State
State: **`left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, `i` is `half_n + 1`.**
