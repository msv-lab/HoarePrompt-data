`left_question_marks` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 2, and the condition that `half_n` is greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2; `half_n` is greater than 0; `left_question_marks` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `half_n` is greater than 0; `left_question_marks` is increased by 1**
