The code `right_question_marks += 1` increments the value of `right_question_marks` by 1. Given that `right_question_marks` is initially 1 if `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'` or 0 otherwise, incrementing it by 1 means it will now be 2 if `ticket[half_n]` was `'?'` and 1 otherwise. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`left_sum` is the sum of all non-question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the count of question mark characters from index 0 to `half_n - 1`, `half_n` must be less than `n`, `ticket` remains unchanged, `i` is `half_n + 1`, `right_sum` is 0 if `ticket[half_n]` is `'?'` or the integer value of `ticket[half_n]` if it is not a question mark, and `right_question_marks` is 2 if `ticket[half_n]` was `'?'` and 1 otherwise.**
