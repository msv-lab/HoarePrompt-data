The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `half_n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `half_n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `half_n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `half_n`.

Given that `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, the first iteration sets `i` to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must become 1. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Since `half_n` is initially greater than 0 and no information is given that would change this condition, it remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `half_n` is greater than 0**
