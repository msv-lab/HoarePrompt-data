#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the modulus \(10^9 + 7\), and p is a positive integer such that \(1 < p\) and \(p\) is coprime with \(a\).
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the modular multiplicative inverse of 'a' modulo 'p', which is calculated as \(a^{p-2} \mod p\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `p`, where `a` is a positive integer representing the modulus \(10^9 + 7\), and `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 < p\) and \(p\) is coprime with \(a\). It returns the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `p`, which is calculated as \(a^{p-2} \mod p\). The function leverages Python’s built-in `pow` function to compute this value efficiently. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `p` is not coprime with `a` (which would raise a `ValueError` due to the nature of the `pow` function when the third argument is specified and the base and modulus are not coprime), or when `p` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function should not proceed as `p` must be greater than 1. If `a` is 0, the result would be undefined in modular arithmetic, but the function will still attempt to compute it, potentially leading to incorrect results.

def func_2(m):
    if (m == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, and MOD is an integer representing 10^9 + 7. The value of `m` is not equal to 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        
        length_sum %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: \(\left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{func\_1}(i, 1000000007) \right) \mod 1000000007\)
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result
    #`The program returns m * length_sum % 1000000007`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` where \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\) and a constant `MOD` representing \(10^9 + 7\). If `m` equals 1, the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the results of calling `func_1(i, MOD)` for all integers `i` from 1 to `m`, taking the modulo `MOD` at each addition. It then multiplies this sum by `m` and takes the modulo `MOD` again before returning the result.
