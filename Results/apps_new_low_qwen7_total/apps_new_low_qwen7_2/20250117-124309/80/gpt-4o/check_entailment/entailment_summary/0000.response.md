### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Vivek repeatedly appends random integers between 1 and \( m \) to an array \( a \).
   - The algorithm stops when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers in \( a \) is 1.
   - We need to find the expected length of the array \( a \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For \( m = 1 \), the GCD is always 1, so the array length is always 1. This matches the output.
   - For \( m > 1 \), we need to consider the probability that appending a number keeps the GCD greater than 1, and the probability that it becomes 1, thus stopping the process.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` computes the modular multiplicative inverse using `pow(a, p - 2, p)`.
   - This is used to calculate \( P \cdot Q^{-1} \mod MOD \), where \( Q \) is the expected length of the array.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - `func_2` calculates the expected length by iterating through numbers from 1 to \( m \).
   - For each number \( i \), it adds the result of `func_1(i, MOD)` to `length_sum`.
   - Finally, it multiplies `length_sum` by \( m \) and takes the modulo \( MOD \).

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly sums the modular inverses, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
   - The implementation handles edge cases like \( m = 1 \) correctly.
   - The modular inverse calculation ensures the final answer is within the required modulus.

Given the analysis, the provided functions seem to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description and the execution summaries.
