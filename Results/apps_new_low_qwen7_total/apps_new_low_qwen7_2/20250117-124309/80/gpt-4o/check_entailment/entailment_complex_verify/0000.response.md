### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given code and compare it with the problem statement to determine the accuracy of the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Vivek starts with an empty array \(a\) and a constant \(m\).
- He repeatedly selects a random integer \(x\) uniformly from the range \([1, m]\) and appends it to the array.
- After each append, he computes the GCD of the array.
- If the GCD is 1, he stops; otherwise, he continues.
- We need to find the expected length of the array \(a\).

#### Given Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(a, p):
       return pow(a, p - 2, p)
   ```
   - This function computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `p` using the formula \(a^{p-2} \mod p\).
   - This is used to calculate the modular inverse, which is not directly relevant to the problem's requirements.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   ```python
   def func_2(m):
       if (m == 1) :
           return 1
       length_sum = 0
       for i in range(1, m + 1):
           length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
           length_sum %= MOD
       result = m * length_sum % MOD
       return result
   ```
   - The function checks if `m` is 1 and returns 1 if true.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `length_sum` to 0 and iterates over integers from 1 to `m`.
   - For each integer `i`, it calls `func_1(i, MOD)` and adds the result to `length_sum`.
   - It then multiplies `length_sum` by `m` and takes the modulo `MOD` again.
   - Finally, it returns the computed value.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The problem requires simulating the process of appending random integers until the GCD becomes 1.
- The given code does not simulate this process at all. Instead, it computes the sum of modular inverses, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.
- The `func_1` function correctly computes the modular inverse, but it is not used in a way that simulates the problem's process.

Given that the code does not follow the problem's specifications and does not simulate the required process, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required algorithm to find the expected length of the array \(a\).
