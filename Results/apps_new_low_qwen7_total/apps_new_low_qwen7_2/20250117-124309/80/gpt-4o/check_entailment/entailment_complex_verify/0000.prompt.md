You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vivek initially has an empty array $a$ and some integer constant $m$.

He performs the following algorithm:  Select a random integer $x$ uniformly in range from $1$ to $m$ and append it to the end of $a$.  Compute the greatest common divisor of integers in $a$.  In case it equals to $1$, break  Otherwise, return to step $1$. 

Find the expected length of $a$. It can be shown that it can be represented as $\frac{P}{Q}$ where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime integers and $Q\neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$. Print the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq 100000$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the expected length of the array $a$ written as $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
1

Input
2

Output
2

Input
4

Output
333333338



-----Note-----

In the first example, since Vivek can choose only integers from $1$ to $1$, he will have $a=[1]$ after the first append operation, and after that quit the algorithm. Hence the length of $a$ is always $1$, so its expected value is $1$ as well.

In the second example, Vivek each time will append either $1$ or $2$, so after finishing the algorithm he will end up having some number of $2$'s (possibly zero), and a single $1$ in the end. The expected length of the list is $1\cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2\cdot \frac{1}{2^2} + 3\cdot \frac{1}{2^3} + \ldots = 2$.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    if m == 1:
        return 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        length_sum %= MOD
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
m = int(input().strip())
print(func_2(m))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the modulus \(10^9 + 7\), and p is a positive integer such that \(1 < p\) and \(p\) is coprime with \(a\).
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the modular multiplicative inverse of 'a' modulo 'p', which is calculated as \(a^{p-2} \mod p\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `p`, where `a` is a positive integer representing the modulus \(10^9 + 7\), and `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 < p\) and \(p\) is coprime with \(a\). It returns the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `p`, which is calculated as \(a^{p-2} \mod p\). The function leverages Python’s built-in `pow` function to compute this value efficiently. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `p` is not coprime with `a` (which would raise a `ValueError` due to the nature of the `pow` function when the third argument is specified and the base and modulus are not coprime), or when `p` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function should not proceed as `p` must be greater than 1. If `a` is 0, the result would be undefined in modular arithmetic, but the function will still attempt to compute it, potentially leading to incorrect results.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, and MOD is an integer representing 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(m):
    if (m == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, and MOD is an integer representing 10^9 + 7. The value of `m` is not equal to 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        
        length_sum %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: \(\left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{func\_1}(i, 1000000007) \right) \mod 1000000007\)
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result
    #`The program returns m * length_sum % 1000000007`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` where \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\) and a constant `MOD` representing \(10^9 + 7\). If `m` equals 1, the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the results of calling `func_1(i, MOD)` for all integers `i` from 1 to `m`, taking the modulo `MOD` at each addition. It then multiplies this sum by `m` and takes the modulo `MOD` again before returning the result.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not accurately calculate the expected length of the array \(a\). 

The problem requires calculating the expected length of the array where each element is appended until the GCD of all elements is 1. The current implementation of `func_2` does not properly simulate this process. Instead, it seems to be attempting to calculate a sum related to modular inverses, which is not directly relevant to the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the process of appending random integers and computing the GCD until the GCD becomes 1, and then calculate the expected length of the array based on these simulations. The provided code does not do this, making it incorrect.
