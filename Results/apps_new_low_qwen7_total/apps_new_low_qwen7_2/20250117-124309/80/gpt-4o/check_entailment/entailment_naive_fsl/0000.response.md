Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not accurately calculate the expected length of the array \(a\). 

The problem requires calculating the expected length of the array where each element is appended until the GCD of all elements is 1. The current implementation of `func_2` does not properly simulate this process. Instead, it seems to be attempting to calculate a sum related to modular inverses, which is not directly relevant to the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the process of appending random integers and computing the GCD until the GCD becomes 1, and then calculate the expected length of the array based on these simulations. The provided code does not do this, making it incorrect.
