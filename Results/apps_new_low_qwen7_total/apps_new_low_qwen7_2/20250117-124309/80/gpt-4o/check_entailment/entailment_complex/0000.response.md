Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if it correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for given inputs.

1. **Understanding the Algorithm**: 
   - Vivek repeatedly appends a random integer between 1 and \( m \) to an array until the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the array is 1.
   - We need to find the expected length of the array \( a \).

2. **Key Points in the Program**:
   - The program correctly defines the constants `MOD` as \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The function `func_1` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of a number using the formula \(a^{p-2} \mod p\), which is correct according to Fermat's Little Theorem when \(a\) and \(p\) are coprime.
   - The function `func_2`:
     - Handles the special case when \(m = 1\) by immediately returning 1.
     - Iterates over all integers from 1 to \(m\), computing the modular multiplicative inverse of each integer using `func_1`.
     - Summarizes these inverses and normalizes the sum modulo \(MOD\).
     - Multiplies this sum by \(m\) and takes the result modulo \(MOD\) to get the final answer.

3. **Verification of Correctness**:
   - The logic for handling the special case \(m = 1\) is correct and matches the problem's expected output.
   - The computation of the modular multiplicative inverse within `func_1` is mathematically sound and correctly implemented.
   - The summation and final multiplication steps in `func_2` are also correct, ensuring that the result is taken modulo \(MOD\).

Given that the program correctly follows the problem's algorithm and the mathematical operations involved are implemented accurately, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
