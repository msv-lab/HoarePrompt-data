Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program should compute the expected length of the array \(a\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's break down the key parts of the program:
1. **Function `func_1(a, p)`**: This function calculates \(a^{p-2} \mod p\) using modular exponentiation, which is the multiplicative inverse of \(a\) modulo \(p\) (assuming \(a\) and \(p\) are coprime).
2. **Function `func_2(m)`**: This function computes the expected length of the array \(a\) for a given \(m\).
   - If \(m = 1\), the array length is always 1.
   - For other values of \(m\), it iterates through all possible values from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each value \(i\), it adds the multiplicative inverse of \(i\) modulo \(MOD\) to `length_sum`.
   - It then multiplies `length_sum` by \(m\) and returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem constraints and the logic described, the program appears to be following the correct approach:
- It correctly handles the base case where \(m = 1\).
- It iteratively computes the sum of the inverses of all numbers from 1 to \(m\).
- It multiplies this sum by \(m\) and takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which aligns with the problem's requirement to find the expected length in the specified format.

Since the program correctly follows the steps described in the problem statement and handles the necessary computations accurately, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
