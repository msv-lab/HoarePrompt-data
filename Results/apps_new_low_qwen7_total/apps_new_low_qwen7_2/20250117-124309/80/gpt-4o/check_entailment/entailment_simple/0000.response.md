Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and Functions:**
   - The problem requires calculating the expected length of an array `a` based on the given algorithm.
   - `func_1` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `i` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `func_2` calculates the expected length of the array by summing the inverses of all numbers from 1 to `m` and then multiplying by `m`.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly uses the formula for the modular multiplicative inverse, \(i^{10^9+6} \mod (10^9+7)\), which is efficient using modular exponentiation.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The base case handles `m == 1` correctly, returning 1.
   - For `m > 1`, the function iterates over all integers from 1 to `m`, calculates their modular inverses, sums them, and then multiplies the sum by `m`. Finally, it takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Algorithm Correctness:**
   - The logic in `func_2` aligns with the mathematical expectation derived from the problem statement.
   - The summation of modular inverses and subsequent multiplication by `m` is the correct approach to find the expected length of the array.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case when `m` is 1 correctly.
   - The loop in `func_2` iterates through all possible values from 1 to `m`, ensuring no cases are missed.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
