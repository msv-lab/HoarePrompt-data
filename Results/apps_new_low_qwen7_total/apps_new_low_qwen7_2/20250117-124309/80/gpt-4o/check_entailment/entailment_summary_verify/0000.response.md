### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to find the expected length of an array \(a\) where elements are appended randomly from the range 1 to \(m\), and the process stops when the GCD of the array elements is 1.
- The result should be given in the form \(P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}\).

#### Given Program Analysis:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - This function computes the modular inverse of `a` modulo `MOD` using the formula \(a^{MOD-2} \mod MOD\).
  - This function is used within `func_2` but is not clear how it relates to the problem directly.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - This function attempts to calculate a sum involving the modular inverses of numbers from 1 to `m`.
  - The logic is:
    - If `m` is 1, it returns 1.
    - Otherwise, it iterates over all integers from 1 to `m`, calls `func_1` with each integer, sums the results, and takes the modulo `MOD`.
    - Finally, it multiplies this sum by `m` and takes the modulo `MOD`.

#### Comparison with Problem Description:
- The function `func_2` does not simulate the process of appending random integers and computing the GCD. Instead, it seems to be calculating a sum of modular inverses, which is not relevant to the problem.
- The expected length calculation in the problem involves complex probabilistic reasoning that is not captured by simply summing modular inverses.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the process of appending random integers and computing the GCD.
- We need to calculate the probability of each possible GCD and use it to determine the expected length.
- The provided code does not capture any of these steps.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required algorithm and logic to find the expected length of the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
