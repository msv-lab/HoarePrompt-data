You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vivek initially has an empty array $a$ and some integer constant $m$.

He performs the following algorithm:  Select a random integer $x$ uniformly in range from $1$ to $m$ and append it to the end of $a$.  Compute the greatest common divisor of integers in $a$.  In case it equals to $1$, break  Otherwise, return to step $1$. 

Find the expected length of $a$. It can be shown that it can be represented as $\frac{P}{Q}$ where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime integers and $Q\neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$. Print the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq 100000$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the expected length of the array $a$ written as $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
1

Input
2

Output
2

Input
4

Output
333333338



-----Note-----

In the first example, since Vivek can choose only integers from $1$ to $1$, he will have $a=[1]$ after the first append operation, and after that quit the algorithm. Hence the length of $a$ is always $1$, so its expected value is $1$ as well.

In the second example, Vivek each time will append either $1$ or $2$, so after finishing the algorithm he will end up having some number of $2$'s (possibly zero), and a single $1$ in the end. The expected length of the list is $1\cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2\cdot \frac{1}{2^2} + 3\cdot \frac{1}{2^3} + \ldots = 2$.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    if m == 1:
        return 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        length_sum %= MOD
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` where \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\) and a constant `MOD` representing \(10^9 + 7\). If `m` equals 1, the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the results of calling `func_1(i, MOD)` for all integers `i` from 1 to `m`, taking the modulo `MOD` at each addition. It then multiplies this sum by `m` and takes the modulo `MOD` again before returning the result.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program should compute the expected length of the array \(a\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's break down the key parts of the program:
1. **Function `func_1(a, p)`**: This function calculates \(a^{p-2} \mod p\) using modular exponentiation, which is the multiplicative inverse of \(a\) modulo \(p\) (assuming \(a\) and \(p\) are coprime).
2. **Function `func_2(m)`**: This function computes the expected length of the array \(a\) for a given \(m\).
   - If \(m = 1\), the array length is always 1.
   - For other values of \(m\), it iterates through all possible values from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each value \(i\), it adds the multiplicative inverse of \(i\) modulo \(MOD\) to `length_sum`.
   - It then multiplies `length_sum` by \(m\) and returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem constraints and the logic described, the program appears to be following the correct approach:
- It correctly handles the base case where \(m = 1\).
- It iteratively computes the sum of the inverses of all numbers from 1 to \(m\).
- It multiplies this sum by \(m\) and takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which aligns with the problem's requirement to find the expected length in the specified format.

Since the program correctly follows the steps described in the problem statement and handles the necessary computations accurately, the given Python program is correct.
