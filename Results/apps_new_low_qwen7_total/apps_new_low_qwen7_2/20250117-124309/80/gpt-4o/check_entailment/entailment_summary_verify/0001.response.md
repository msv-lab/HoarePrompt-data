Reasoning:

Upon careful analysis of the problem and the provided program, let's verify if the program correctly implements the logic described.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to compute the expected length of the array \(a\) when elements are appended randomly until the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the array is 1.
   - The expected length can be represented as \(\frac{P}{Q}\), and the output should be \(P \cdot Q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Function `func_1(a, p)`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the modular inverse of \(a\) modulo \(p\) using `pow(a, p - 2, p)`, which is the correct way to find the modular inverse assuming \(a\) and \(p\) are coprime.

3. **Function `func_2(m)`**:
   - **Base Case**: If \(m = 1\), the array will always have a GCD of 1 after the first element is added, so the expected length is 1. This part is correct.
   - **General Case**: The function iterates through all possible values from 1 to \(m\) and sums their modular inverses. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
     - The function should be summing the lengths contributed by each number from 1 to \(m\) when the GCD of the current array is not 1. Instead, it is simply summing the modular inverses, which does not capture the expected length correctly.
     - To correctly compute the expected length, we need to consider the probability of the GCD being greater than 1 after each addition and update the expected length accordingly.

4. **Expected Length Calculation**:
   - The expected length \(E\) can be derived from the probability that the GCD of the array is not 1 after each addition.
   - The correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a recursive method to compute the expected length, considering the probability of each number being added and the resulting GCD.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the expected length of the array \(a\). The summation of modular inverses does not reflect the actual expected length as required by the problem statement.

Final: **False**
