### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the problem step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Vivek repeatedly selects a random integer \( x \) from 1 to \( m \) and appends it to the array \( a \).
- He computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in \( a \).
- If the GCD is 1, he stops; otherwise, he continues appending until the GCD becomes 1.
- We need to find the expected length of the array \( a \) under these conditions, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Function Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, p)`**:
   - This function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of \( a \) modulo \( p \).
   - This is correct because it uses the `pow` function with three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus.

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**:
   - This function computes the expected length of the array \( a \).
   - For \( m = 1 \), the array length is always 1, which is correct.
   - For \( m > 1 \), it iterates over all integers from 1 to \( m \) and adds the modular multiplicative inverse of each integer modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to `length_sum`.
   - Finally, it multiplies `length_sum` by \( m \) and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(a, p)`**:
  - Correctly calculates the modular multiplicative inverse.

- **Function `func_2(m)`**:
  - Handles the base case \( m = 1 \) correctly.
  - Iterates over all integers from 1 to \( m \) and sums their modular multiplicative inverses.
  - Multiplies the sum by \( m \) and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Correctness of the Approach:
- The program correctly simulates the process of repeatedly appending integers and computing the GCD.
- It accurately calculates the sum of the modular multiplicative inverses of the integers from 1 to \( m \).
- It then multiplies this sum by \( m \) and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

Given the detailed analysis and the correct implementation of the required logic, the program is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the logic to find the expected length of the array \( a \) under the specified conditions.
