### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the expected length of the array \(a\) when elements are appended one by one, and the process stops when the GCD of all elements in the array is 1. The output should be given as \(P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}\).

#### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `p` using the formula \(a^{p-2} \mod p\).
   - This function is used in `func_2` but does not seem to be directly related to the problem's requirements.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to compute a sum involving the modular multiplicative inverses of numbers from 1 to `m`.
   - The sum is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The result is returned as `m * length_sum % MOD`, which does not directly simulate the process of appending numbers and checking the GCD.

#### Key Points:
- The provided code does not simulate the process of appending random integers and checking their GCD.
- The computation of modular inverses does not address the core requirement of the problem.
- The final expression `m * length_sum % MOD` does not reflect the expected length of the array under the given conditions.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly simulate the problem's requirements. The function `func_2` does not properly handle the process of appending numbers and checking their GCD until the GCD becomes 1. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem.
