The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `p`, where `a` is a positive integer representing the modulus \(10^9 + 7\), and `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 < p\) and \(p\) is coprime with \(a\). It returns the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `p`, which is calculated as \(a^{p-2} \mod p\). The function leverages Pythonâ€™s built-in `pow` function to compute this value efficiently. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `p` is not coprime with `a` (which would raise a `ValueError` due to the nature of the `pow` function when the third argument is specified and the base and modulus are not coprime), or when `p` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function should not proceed as `p` must be greater than 1. If `a` is 0, the result would be undefined in modular arithmetic, but the function will still attempt to compute it, potentially leading to incorrect results.
