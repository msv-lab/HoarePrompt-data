Let's analyze the given Python loop and the provided information step-by-step.

### 1. Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = m`, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive. In each iteration, it updates `length_sum` by adding the result of `func_1(i, MOD)` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The value of `MOD` is fixed at \(10^9 + 7\).

### 2. Track Variable Changes
- **Invariants**: 
  - `MOD` remains constant at \(10^9 + 7\).
  - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).

- **Variables Updated in the Loop**:
  - `length_sum`: Initially 0, updated in each iteration by adding `func_1(i, MOD)` and then taking modulo `MOD`.

### 3. Summarize the Loop Behavior
After the loop completes all iterations from `i = 1` to `i = m`, the final value of `length_sum` will be the sum of `func_1(i, MOD)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Specifically, the loop will execute exactly `m` times.

### 4. Verify Relationships
From the provided outputs, we can see that the relationship holds for the first few iterations. For example, after the loop executes 1 time:
\[ \text{length\_sum} = \text{func\_1}(1, 1000000007) \mod 1000000007 \]
After the loop executes 2 times:
\[ \text{length\_sum} = (\text{length\_sum} + \text{func\_1}(2, 1000000007) + \text{func\_1}(1, 1000000007)) \mod 1000000007 \]
And so on.

### Final Calculation
Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m`, the final value of `length_sum` will be:
\[ \text{length\_sum} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{func\_1}(i, 1000000007) \right) \mod 1000000007 \]

### Output State
Output State: **\(\left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{func\_1}(i, 1000000007) \right) \mod 1000000007\)**
