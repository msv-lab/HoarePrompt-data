Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the range for `i` as `range(1, m + 1)`. This means `i` will iterate from 1 to `m` inclusive.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `length_sum` is updated as `length_sum = (length_sum + func_1(3, 1000000007)) % 1000000007`.
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\).
   - `MOD` is 1000000007.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `m`.
   - If `i` is 3, the next value of `i` would be 4.
   - Therefore, `m` must still be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `m`.

So, the updated state will be:
- `length_sum` remains unchanged as it was not specified to change in the next iteration.
- `i` becomes 4.
- `m` must remain such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\) and \(m \geq 4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`length_sum` is (length_sum + func_1(3, 1000000007)) % 1000000007, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000 and m ≥ 4**
