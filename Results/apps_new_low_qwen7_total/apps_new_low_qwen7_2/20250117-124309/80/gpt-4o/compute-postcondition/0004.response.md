State: **`length_sum` is 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, and MOD is an integer representing 10^9 + 7, `i` is 1, and `i` must be less than or equal to `m`**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop runs using `range(1, m + 1)`, which means the loop will start with `i` equal to 1 and continue until `i` reaches `m`.
2. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(1, m + 1)`.
3. Therefore, at the beginning of the loop, `i` should be set to 1 (the starting value of the range).
4. Additionally, `i` must be less than or equal to `m` to ensure the loop can proceed as intended.

Given this, the initial state before the loop starts must include `i` being 1 and ensuring `i` is less than or equal to `m`.
