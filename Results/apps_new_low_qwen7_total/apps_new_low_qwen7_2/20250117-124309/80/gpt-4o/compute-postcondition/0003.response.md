The code initializes `length_sum` to 0. This assignment does not affect the value of `m` or `MOD`. Therefore, the only changes are to the variables `length_sum` and keeping the initial values of `m` and `MOD`.

Output State: **`length_sum` is 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, and MOD is an integer representing 10^9 + 7.**
