Output State: **length_sum is (length_sum + func_1(4, 1000000007) + func_1(3, 1000000007)) % 1000000007, i is 4, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000 and m ≥ 4**

Explanation:
- The first line of the code block updates `length_sum` by adding the result of `func_1(i, MOD)` where `i` is 4 and `MOD` is 1000000007, then taking modulo 1000000007.
- The second line updates `length_sum` again by adding the result of `func_1(3, 1000000007)`, then taking modulo 1000000007.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged at 4.
- The variable `m` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000 and m ≥ 4, as no code modifies it.
