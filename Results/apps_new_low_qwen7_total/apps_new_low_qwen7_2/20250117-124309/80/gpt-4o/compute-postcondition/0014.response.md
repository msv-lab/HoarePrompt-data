Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` where \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\) and a constant `MOD` representing \(10^9 + 7\). If `m` equals 1, the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the results of calling `func_1(i, MOD)` for all integers `i` from 1 to `m`, taking the modulo `MOD` at each addition. It then multiplies this sum by `m` and takes the modulo `MOD` again before returning the result.**

This summary covers the following:
- The function checks if `m` is 1 and returns 1 if true.
- If `m` is greater than 1, it iterates from 1 to `m`, summing the results of `func_1(i, MOD)`.
- It ensures the intermediate sum remains within the bounds of `MOD` by taking the modulo `MOD` at each addition.
- Finally, it multiplies the resulting sum by `m` and takes the modulo `MOD` to produce the final result, which is then returned.

Potential edge case:
- When `m` is 1, the function directly returns 1 without entering the loop.
