Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m`. This means the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `length_sum` is `(func_1(1, MOD) % MOD)`
   - `i` is 2
   - `m` is an integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100000`
   - `MOD` is `1000000007`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `m` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `length_sum` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `m` remains as it was before.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`length_sum` is (func_1(1, MOD) % MOD), `i` is 3, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, `MOD` is 1000000007**
