The initial state is given as \(( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{func\_1}(i, 1000000007) ) \mod 1000000007\).

The code snippet updates the variable `result` as follows:
```python
result = m * length_sum % MOD
```

Here, `MOD` is `1000000007`. The variable `length_sum` is not defined in the initial state, but it is used in the assignment. We can assume that `length_sum` is a previously calculated sum (which is the sum of the results of `func_1(i, 1000000007)` from `i=1` to `i=m`). 

Given the initial state, we know that `m` is already defined and the summation part of the initial state is computed and taken modulo `1000000007`. The code assigns the product of `m` and `length_sum` modulo `1000000007` to `result`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the variable `result` is updated to `m * length_sum % 1000000007`, and the other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **\(( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{func\_1}(i, 1000000007) ) \mod 1000000007, `result` is `m * length_sum % 1000000007`\)**
