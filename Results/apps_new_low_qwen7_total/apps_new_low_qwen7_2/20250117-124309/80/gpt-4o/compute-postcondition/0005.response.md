Output State: **length_sum is (func_1(1, MOD) % MOD), i is 2, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, MOD is 1000000007**

Explanation:
- The first line `length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)` adds the result of `func_1(i, MOD)` to `length_sum`. Since `i` is initially 1, this effectively computes `func_1(1, MOD)` and adds it to `length_sum`.
- The second line `length_sum %= MOD` ensures that `length_sum` is taken modulo `MOD`, which is `1000000007` (10^9 + 7).
- After these operations, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The values of `m` and `MOD` remain unchanged.
