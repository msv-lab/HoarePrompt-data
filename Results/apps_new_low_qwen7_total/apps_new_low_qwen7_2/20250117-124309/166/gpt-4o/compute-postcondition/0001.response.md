The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on certain conditions involving the non-negative integers `b`, `d`, and `s`, where 0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18 and b + d + s ≥ 1. However, since the function definition itself does not include any parameters, the parameters `b`, `d`, and `s` are considered external to the function and are not directly passed to it.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the non-negative integers b, d, and s, where 0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18 and b + d + s ≥ 1.**
