The given code takes three non-negative integers `b`, `d`, and `s` as input, splits them from a single input line, and then calculates the number of missed meals for each type (bread, drink, and soup) based on the maximum number of meals that can be taken (`max_meals`). It then sums up these missed meals and prints the total. 

Since the initial values of `b`, `d`, and `s` are provided as non-negative integers within the range [0, 10^18] and their sum is at least 1, we need to simulate this with example values to derive the final state. Let's assume example values `b = 2`, `d = 3`, and `s = 1` for demonstration purposes.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step execution of the code with these values:

1. `b, d, s = map(int, input().split())`:
   - Input: "2 3 1"
   - After this line, `b = 2`, `d = 3`, `s = 1`.

2. `max_meals = max(b, d, s)`:
   - `max_meals` is set to the maximum value among `b`, `d`, and `s`, which is 3.

3. `missed_b = max(0, max_meals - 1 - b)`:
   - `missed_b = max(0, 3 - 1 - 2) = max(0, 0) = 0`

4. `missed_d = max(0, max_meals - 1 - d)`:
   - `missed_d = max(0, 3 - 1 - 3) = max(0, -1) = 0`

5. `missed_s = max(0, max_meals - 1 - s)`:
   - `missed_s = max(0, 3 - 1 - 1) = max(0, 1) = 1`

6. `total_missed_meals = missed_b + missed_d + missed_s`:
   - `total_missed_meals = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`

7. `print(total_missed_meals)`:
   - Prints `1`

Given that the input values and the operations performed do not change the values of `b`, `d`, or `s` beyond their initial assignment, and only create new variables (`max_meals`, `missed_b`, `missed_d`, `missed_s`, and `total_missed_meals`), the final state of the variables is:

Output State: **b is 2, d is 3, s is 1, total_missed_meals is 1**
