Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where Vasiliy arrives just before breakfast and leaves just after supper on the same day. In this case, the minimum number of missed meals should be zero, but the program incorrectly calculates a higher value.

For example, consider the input `1 1 1`. According to the problem description, Vasiliy could have arrived just before breakfast and left just after supper on the same day, meaning he did not miss any meals. However, the program calculates:

- `missed_b = max(0, max(1, 1, 1) - 1 - 1) = max(0, 1 - 1 - 1) = 1`
- `missed_d = max(0, max(1, 1, 1) - 1 - 1) = max(0, 1 - 1 - 1) = 1`
- `missed_s = max(0, max(1, 1, 1) - 1 - 1) = max(0, 1 - 1 - 1) = 1`

Thus, `total_missed_meals = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this specific case.
