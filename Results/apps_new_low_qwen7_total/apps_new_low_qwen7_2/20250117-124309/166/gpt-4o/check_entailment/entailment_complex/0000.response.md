Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum number of meals that Vasiliy could have missed by considering the scenario where each type of meal (breakfast, dinner, supper) could potentially have been had once more if Vasiliy had stayed an extra day. However, the logic in the code is flawed because it does not account for the actual number of meals taken and how they can be distributed over the days Vasiliy was present. 

For example, if Vasiliy took all his meals, the code incorrectly counts missed meals, which should not happen. The logic should consider the possibility that Vasiliy could have arrived or left without taking a specific meal, and thus, the maximum possible meals for each type should be calculated based on the actual distribution of meals over the days he was present, not just assuming he could have had one more meal of each type.

Here is the corrected approach:
1. Calculate the total number of days Vasiliy was present.
2. Determine the number of missed meals by subtracting the actual number of meals from the total possible meals for each type, considering the days he was present.

Given the correct logic, the program should be:

```python
def func():
    b, d, s = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Calculate the total number of days Vasiliy was present
    total_days = max(b, d, s)
    
    # Calculate missed meals for each type
    missed_b = max(0, total_days - b)
    missed_d = max(0, total_days - d)
    missed_s = max(0, total_days - s)
    
    # Total missed meals
    total_missed_meals = missed_b + missed_d + missed_s
    
    print(total_missed_meals)
```

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
