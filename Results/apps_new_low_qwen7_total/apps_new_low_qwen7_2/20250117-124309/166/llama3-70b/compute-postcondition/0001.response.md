The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is undefined in the given information since no operations or return values are specified. However, based on the constraints provided, the function presumably deals with the non-negative integers `b`, `d`, and `s` where 0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18 and b + d + s ≥ 1.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is undefined based on the constraints provided (0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18 and b + d + s ≥ 1).**
