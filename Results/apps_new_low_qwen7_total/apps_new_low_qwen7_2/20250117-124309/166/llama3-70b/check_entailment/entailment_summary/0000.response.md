Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads three integers \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) from the input, representing the number of breakfasts, dinners, and suppers respectively.
2. The goal is to find the minimum number of meals that Vasiliy could have missed.
3. To achieve this, the program calculates the maximum value among the differences \(b - d\), \(b - s\), and \(d - s\).
4. Here's the breakdown of the logic:
   - \(b - d\) represents the excess number of breakfasts over dinners.
   - \(b - s\) represents the excess number of breakfasts over suppers.
   - \(d - s\) represents the excess number of dinners over suppers.
5. The maximum of these differences gives the total number of meals (either breakfasts, dinners, or suppers) that could be missed.
6. Adding 0 ensures that the result is always non-negative, as the number of missed meals cannot be negative.
7. This approach accounts for all potential scenarios where Vasiliy might have missed certain meals based on the constraints provided.
8. The code handles edge cases well, such as when \(b\), \(d\), or \(s\) are at their boundary values (0 or \(10^{18}\)), and the condition \(b + d + s \geq 1\) is inherently satisfied by the input format.
9. The program correctly outputs the result without raising any errors under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
