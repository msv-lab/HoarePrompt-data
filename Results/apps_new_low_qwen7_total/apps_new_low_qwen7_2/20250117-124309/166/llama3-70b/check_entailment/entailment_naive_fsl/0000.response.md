Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of meals that Vasiliy could have missed. The logic in the `max` function is flawed. Specifically, the expression `max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s)` does not account for the possibility of missing multiple meals on the same day.

For example, consider the following input:
- Input: `4 2 1`
- Expected Output: `1` (Vasiliy could have missed one dinner, e.g., if he arrived after breakfast and left before supper).
- Program Output: `2` (The program incorrectly calculates `max(0, 4 - 2, 4 - 1, 2 - 1)`, which results in `2`).

The correct approach would involve calculating the maximum number of consecutive meals that could have been missed on each day. This requires a more complex logic to handle different arrival and departure scenarios accurately.
