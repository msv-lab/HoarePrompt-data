Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads three integers `b`, `d`, and `s` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This part is correct.

2. **Calculation of Missed Meals**: 
   - The expression `max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s)` aims to calculate the minimum possible number of missed meals.
   - `b - d` would give the number of breakfasts minus dinners, indicating how many breakfasts occurred without a corresponding dinner.
   - `b - s` would give the number of breakfasts minus suppers, indicating how many breakfasts occurred without a corresponding supper.
   - `d - s` would give the number of dinners minus suppers, indicating how many dinners occurred without a corresponding supper.
   - Taking the maximum of these values ensures that we account for the scenario where the most missed meals could be in any combination (breakfast without dinner, breakfast without supper, or dinner without supper).

3. **Handling Negative Values**: 
   - The `max(0, ...)` function ensures that if the difference results in a negative value (meaning more dinners or suppers than breakfasts), it is treated as zero, meaning no additional missed meals can be counted in that direction.

4. **Output**: The result of the calculation is directly printed, which is correct.

Given the above points, the program logic seems to accurately calculate the minimum possible number of meals that could have been missed according to the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
