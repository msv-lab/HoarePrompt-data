Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of meals that Vasiliy could have missed during his stay at the sanatorium.

1. **Arrival and Departure Scenarios**:
   - If Vasiliy arrives before breakfast, he can miss one of the first breakfasts.
   - If he arrives before dinner, he can miss one of the first dinners.
   - If he arrives before supper, he can miss one of the first suppers.
   - If he leaves after supper, he will have missed no meals.

2. **Calculation**:
   - We need to consider the difference between the number of each meal and the next meal to find out how many meals could have been missed. This is because the maximum possible missed meals would be the difference between the counts of the current meal and the subsequent meal in the sequence (breakfast, dinner, supper).

Given the constraints, the formula `max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s)` calculates the following:
- `b - d`: The difference between the number of breakfasts and dinners. This represents the maximum number of breakfasts that could have been missed if Vasiliy arrived before dinner.
- `b - s`: The difference between the number of breakfasts and suppers. This represents the maximum number of breakfasts that could have been missed if Vasiliy arrived before supper.
- `d - s`: The difference between the number of dinners and suppers. This represents the maximum number of dinners that could have been missed if Vasiliy arrived before supper.

The `max(0, ...)` ensures that if the result is negative, it is treated as zero, meaning no meals could have been missed under those conditions.

The program correctly implements this logic and returns the minimum possible number of missed meals.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
