You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vasiliy spent his vacation in a sanatorium, came back and found that he completely forgot details of his vacation! 

Every day there was a breakfast, a dinner and a supper in a dining room of the sanatorium (of course, in this order). The only thing that Vasiliy has now is a card from the dining room contaning notes how many times he had a breakfast, a dinner and a supper (thus, the card contains three integers). Vasiliy could sometimes have missed some meal, for example, he could have had a breakfast and a supper, but a dinner, or, probably, at some days he haven't been at the dining room at all.

Vasiliy doesn't remember what was the time of the day when he arrived to sanatorium (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper), and the time when he left it (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper). So he considers any of these options. After Vasiliy arrived to the sanatorium, he was there all the time until he left. Please note, that it's possible that Vasiliy left the sanatorium on the same day he arrived.

According to the notes in the card, help Vasiliy determine the minimum number of meals in the dining room that he could have missed. We shouldn't count as missed meals on the arrival day before Vasiliy's arrival and meals on the departure day after he left.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers b, d and s (0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18,  b + d + s ≥ 1) — the number of breakfasts, dinners and suppers which Vasiliy had during his vacation in the sanatorium. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum possible number of meals which Vasiliy could have missed during his vacation.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, Vasiliy could have missed one supper, for example, in case he have arrived before breakfast, have been in the sanatorium for two days (including the day of arrival) and then have left after breakfast on the third day. 

In the second sample, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast, have had it, and immediately have left the sanatorium, not missing any meal.

In the third sample, Vasiliy could have been in the sanatorium for one day, not missing any meal.

- Program: 
def func():
    (b, d, s) = map(int, input().split())
    print(max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, d, and s are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18 and b + d + s ≥ 1.
def func():
    b, d, s = map(int, input().split())

print(max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three non-negative integers \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) from standard input, ensuring \(0 \leq b, d, s \leq 10^{18}\) and \(b + d + s \geq 1\). It then computes the maximum value among \(b - d\), \(b - s\), and \(d - s\), and outputs this value. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly to standard output. Potential edge cases include when one or more of the values are at their boundary conditions (0 or \(10^{18}\)). If \(b + d + s < 1\), the program will raise an error due to the initial condition check being missing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of meals that Vasiliy could have missed during his stay at the sanatorium.

1. **Arrival and Departure Scenarios**:
   - If Vasiliy arrives before breakfast, he can miss one of the first breakfasts.
   - If he arrives before dinner, he can miss one of the first dinners.
   - If he arrives before supper, he can miss one of the first suppers.
   - If he leaves after supper, he will have missed no meals.

2. **Calculation**:
   - We need to consider the difference between the number of each meal and the next meal to find out how many meals could have been missed. This is because the maximum possible missed meals would be the difference between the counts of the current meal and the subsequent meal in the sequence (breakfast, dinner, supper).

Given the constraints, the formula `max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s)` calculates the following:
- `b - d`: The difference between the number of breakfasts and dinners. This represents the maximum number of breakfasts that could have been missed if Vasiliy arrived before dinner.
- `b - s`: The difference between the number of breakfasts and suppers. This represents the maximum number of breakfasts that could have been missed if Vasiliy arrived before supper.
- `d - s`: The difference between the number of dinners and suppers. This represents the maximum number of dinners that could have been missed if Vasiliy arrived before supper.

The `max(0, ...)` ensures that if the result is negative, it is treated as zero, meaning no meals could have been missed under those conditions.

The program correctly implements this logic and returns the minimum possible number of missed meals.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
