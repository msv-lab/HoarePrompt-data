The function takes no explicit parameters but reads an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers, where each integer in \( a \) is between 28 and 31 inclusive. It then checks if the elements of \( a \) match any of two possible sequences of 12 integers, which represent the number of days in months (either January to December or February to January of the next year). If any of these sequences match a cyclic shift of the elements in \( a \), it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
