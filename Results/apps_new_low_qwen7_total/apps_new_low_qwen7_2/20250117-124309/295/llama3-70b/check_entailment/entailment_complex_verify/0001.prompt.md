You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Everybody in Russia uses Gregorian calendar. In this calendar there are 31 days in January, 28 or 29 days in February (depending on whether the year is leap or not), 31 days in March, 30 days in April, 31 days in May, 30 in June, 31 in July, 31 in August, 30 in September, 31 in October, 30 in November, 31 in December.

A year is leap in one of two cases: either its number is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or is divisible by 400. For example, the following years are leap: 2000, 2004, but years 1900 and 2018 are not leap.

In this problem you are given n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of n consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is a_1 days, duration of the next month is a_2 days, and so on.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) — the number of integers.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (28 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 31) — the numbers you are to check.


-----Output-----

If there are several consecutive months that fit the sequence, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (small or large).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
31 31 30 31

Output
Yes


Input
2
30 30

Output
No


Input
5
29 31 30 31 30

Output
Yes


Input
3
31 28 30

Output
No


Input
3
31 31 28

Output
Yes




-----Note-----

In the first example the integers can denote months July, August, September and October.

In the second example the answer is no, because there are no two consecutive months each having 30 days.

In the third example the months are: February (leap year) — March — April – May — June.

In the fourth example the number of days in the second month is 28, so this is February. March follows February and has 31 days, but not 30, so the answer is NO.

In the fifth example the months are: December — January — February (non-leap year).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 24, and the list a contains n integers where each integer a_i is an integer such that 28 ≤ a_i ≤ 31.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]

f = False
    for i in range(12):
        if all(a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12] for j in range(n)):
            f = True
        
        if i == 11 and not f:
            break
        
        if all(a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12 + 12] for j in range(n)):
            f = True
        
        if i == 11 and not f:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - `i` is 12 (since the loop always runs up to 11 and then exits).
    #- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\).
    #- `f` is `True` if any of the conditions in the loop were satisfied before `i` reached 11; otherwise, `f` is `False`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #Output State:
    if f :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `i` is 12, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and the printed output is 'YES' if `f` is `True`; otherwise, `f` remains `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no explicit parameters but reads an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers, where each integer in \( a \) is between 28 and 31 inclusive. It then checks if the elements of \( a \) match any of two possible sequences of 12 integers, which represent the number of days in months (either January to December or February to January of the next year). If any of these sequences match a cyclic shift of the elements in \( a \), it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program is designed to check if a sequence of `n` integers can represent the number of days in consecutive months according to the Gregorian calendar.
2. The program defines a list `b` with the number of days in each month (with February having 28 days).
3. It iterates over each possible starting month (12 times, once for each month of the year).
4. For each starting month, it checks two conditions:
   - If the sequence matches the days in the months starting from the current month and wrapping around to the beginning of the year.
   - If the sequence matches the days in the months starting from the current month and continuing into the next year.
5. If either condition is met, it sets the flag `f` to `True`.
6. After checking all possible starting months, it prints 'YES' if any condition was met, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Upon careful examination, the program correctly checks both the current and next-year scenarios for each starting month, and it handles all the given test cases accurately.
