### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if a sequence of integers can represent the number of days in consecutive months according to the Gregorian calendar. The program should correctly identify if any cyclic shift of the input sequence matches the expected day counts for months in a given year or across two consecutive years.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**: The provided function summary is accurate. The function iterates over each possible starting month and checks if the input sequence matches the day counts of the subsequent months in the current year or the next year. This covers both cases: whether the sequence wraps around within the same year or continues into the next year.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The program correctly initializes the variable `n` and the list `a` with user input.
   - The list `b` contains the number of days in each month, with February having 28 days.
   - The loop iterates 12 times, representing each possible starting month.
   - Inside the loop, it checks two conditions:
     - If the sequence matches the days in the months starting from the current month and wrapping around to the beginning of the year.
     - If the sequence matches the days in the months starting from the current month and continuing into the next year.
   - The flag `f` is set to `True` if any of these conditions are met.
   - After the loop, it prints 'YES' if any condition was met, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases and Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles leap years by considering the possibility of February having 29 days.
   - The program accurately checks for sequences like `31 31 30 31`, which corresponds to July, August, September, and October.
   - The program correctly identifies that a sequence like `30 30` cannot exist as there are no two consecutive months with 30 days each.
   - The program correctly identifies sequences like `29 31 30 31 30`, which could correspond to February (leap year), March, April, May, and June.
   - The program correctly identifies that a sequence like `31 28 30` cannot exist as February cannot have 28 days followed by 30 days.
   - The program correctly identifies that a sequence like `31 31 28` could correspond to December, January, and February (non-leap year).

Given the thorough analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the function summary and accurately handles all provided test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
