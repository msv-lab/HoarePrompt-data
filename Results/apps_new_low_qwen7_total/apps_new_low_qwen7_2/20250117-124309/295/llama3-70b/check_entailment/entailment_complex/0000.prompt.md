Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Everybody in Russia uses Gregorian calendar. In this calendar there are 31 days in January, 28 or 29 days in February (depending on whether the year is leap or not), 31 days in March, 30 days in April, 31 days in May, 30 in June, 31 in July, 31 in August, 30 in September, 31 in October, 30 in November, 31 in December.

A year is leap in one of two cases: either its number is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or is divisible by 400. For example, the following years are leap: 2000, 2004, but years 1900 and 2018 are not leap.

In this problem you are given n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of n consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is a_1 days, duration of the next month is a_2 days, and so on.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) — the number of integers.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (28 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 31) — the numbers you are to check.


-----Output-----

If there are several consecutive months that fit the sequence, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (small or large).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
31 31 30 31

Output
Yes


Input
2
30 30

Output
No


Input
5
29 31 30 31 30

Output
Yes


Input
3
31 28 30

Output
No


Input
3
31 31 28

Output
Yes




-----Note-----

In the first example the integers can denote months July, August, September and October.

In the second example the answer is no, because there are no two consecutive months each having 30 days.

In the third example the months are: February (leap year) — March — April – May — June.

In the fourth example the number of days in the second month is 28, so this is February. March follows February and has 31 days, but not 30, so the answer is NO.

In the fifth example the months are: December — January — February (non-leap year).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 24, and the list a contains n integers where each integer a_i is an integer such that 28 ≤ a_i ≤ 31.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]

f = False
    for i in range(12):
        if all(a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12] for j in range(n)):
            f = True
        
        if i == 11 and not f:
            break
        
        if all(a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12 + 12] for j in range(n)):
            f = True
        
        if i == 11 and not f:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - `i` is 12 (since the loop always runs up to 11 and then exits).
    #- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\).
    #- `f` is `True` if any of the conditions in the loop were satisfied before `i` reached 11; otherwise, `f` is `False`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #Output State:
    if f :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `i` is 12, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and the printed output is 'YES' if `f` is `True`; otherwise, `f` remains `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no explicit parameters but reads an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers, where each integer in \( a \) is between 28 and 31 inclusive. It then checks if the elements of \( a \) match any of two possible sequences of 12 integers, which represent the number of days in months (either January to December or February to January of the next year). If any of these sequences match a cyclic shift of the elements in \( a \), it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
