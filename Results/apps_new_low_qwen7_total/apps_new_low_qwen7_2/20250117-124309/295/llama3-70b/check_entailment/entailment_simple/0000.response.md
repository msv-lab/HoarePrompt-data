### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the number of days in consecutive months.

2. **Calendar Setup**: The program sets up a list `b` containing the number of days in each month of the Gregorian calendar, accounting for February's varying number of days based on whether it is a leap year or not.

3. **Checking Conditions**: 
   - The program iterates over possible starting months using a for loop (`i` ranges from 0 to 11, representing January through December).
   - For each starting month, it checks if the given sequence of days `a` matches the days in the corresponding months starting from the current month `i` and wrapping around if necessary (using modulo 12).
   - It also checks the same sequence starting from the next month after wrapping around.

4. **Flag Setting**: If a match is found, the flag `f` is set to `True`.

5. **Output**: After the loop, the program prints 'YES' if `f` is `True`, indicating that a valid sequence of consecutive months was found. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The program logic correctly implements the problem requirements. It iterates over all possible starting months, checks the given sequence of days against the calendar, and properly sets the flag to indicate a valid sequence. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
