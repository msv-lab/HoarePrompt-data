Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the input sequence includes the number of days in February during a leap year. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility that February might have 29 days.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
Input:
3
29 31 28

Output:
YES
```

According to the problem description, the sequence `29, 31, 28` could correspond to February (leap year), March, and April. However, the program incorrectly returns "NO" for this input because it does not check for the possibility of February having 29 days.

The program checks for matching sequences against the standard month lengths array `b`, but it does not handle the special case of February in a leap year. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it fails to meet the requirements for certain valid input cases.
