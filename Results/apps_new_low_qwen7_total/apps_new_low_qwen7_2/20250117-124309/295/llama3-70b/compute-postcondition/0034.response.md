The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `f`. It only prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 12, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and `f` is `True` if any of the conditions in the loop were satisfied before `i` reached 11; otherwise, `f` is `False`. The if condition is true since `f` is `True`. Printed output: 'YES'**
