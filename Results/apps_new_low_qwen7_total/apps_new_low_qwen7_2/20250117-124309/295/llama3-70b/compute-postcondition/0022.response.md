Postcondition: ***`i` is 12, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and `f` remains unchanged (still True). If `i` equals 11 and `f` is not True, then `f` remains unchanged (still False).***

Explanation:
- The if condition checks if `i` equals 11 and `f` is not True.
- If the condition is true, `f` remains unchanged (still False).
- If the condition is false, `f` remains unchanged (still True).

Thus, the overall postcondition states that `i` and `n` remain as specified in the precondition, and `f` remains unchanged regardless of the if condition evaluation.
