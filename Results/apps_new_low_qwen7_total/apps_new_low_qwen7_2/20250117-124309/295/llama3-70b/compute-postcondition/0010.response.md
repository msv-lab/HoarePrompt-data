Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and `f` remains unchanged. For all \(j\) in the range of \(0 \leq j < n\), if the condition `all((a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12 + 12] for j in range(n)))` is true, then \(a[j] = b[(i + j) \% 12 + 12]\); otherwise, the condition `f` being `False` when `i` was 11 holds.***
