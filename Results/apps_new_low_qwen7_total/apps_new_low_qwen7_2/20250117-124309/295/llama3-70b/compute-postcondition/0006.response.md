The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but rather breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the execution exits the current loop or conditional block it is in.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 11
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\)
- `f` remains unchanged
- For all \(j\) in the range of \(0 \leq j < n\), \(a[j] = b[(i + j) \% 12]\) unless the condition `f` is `False` when `i` was 11

Since the `break` statement is not specified to be within a loop or conditional block that would otherwise change these values, the values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 11, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), `f` remains unchanged, and for all \(j\) in the range of \(0 \leq j < n\), \(a[j] = b[(i + j) \% 12]\) unless the condition `f` is `False` when `i` was 11.**
