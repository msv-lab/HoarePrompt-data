Postcondition: **`i` is 13, `n` is an integer such that \(13 < n \leq 24\), and `f` is `True` if all elements in the array `a` are equal to the corresponding elements in the array `b` as specified by the condition \(a[j] == b[(i + j) \% 12 + 12]\) for all \(j\) in the range \(0\) to \(n-1\); otherwise, `f` remains unchanged.**
