The code assigns the value `True` to the variable `f`. This changes the value of `f` but does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value of `f` and keeps the original values of `i` and `n`.

Output State: **`i` is 12, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and `f` is True**
