Functionality: **The function takes no explicit parameters but reads an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers, where each integer in \( a \) is between 28 and 31 inclusive. It then checks if the elements of \( a \) match any of two possible sequences of 12 integers, which represent the number of days in months (either January to December or February to January of the next year). If any of these sequences match a cyclic shift of the elements in \( a \), it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If \( n \) is not within the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 24 \), the function does not handle this case explicitly. However, since the code only checks for a match within a fixed size (12 elements), the check will still run even if \( n > 12 \), but the result will be incorrect because the comparison will exceed the bounds of the list \( a \).
- The code assumes that the input list \( a \) will always contain valid integers between 28 and 31, but no validation is performed to ensure this. If invalid inputs are provided, the function may produce unexpected results.
- The function does not handle the case where \( n = 12 \) exactly, meaning it checks both sequences starting from January and from February, even though in practice, the sequence from February to January would not be considered a valid match for a list of 12 integers.

After the function concludes, the state of the program will be:
- \( i \) will be 12.
- \( n \) will remain the same integer \( 1 \leq n \leq 24 \).
- The output will be either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether a match was found in the sequences of 12 integers representing month days.
