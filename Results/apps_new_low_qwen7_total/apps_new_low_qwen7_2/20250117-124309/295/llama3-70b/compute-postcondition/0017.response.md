The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `f`. It only breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the initial state, the value of `f` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 12, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and `f` remains unchanged.**
