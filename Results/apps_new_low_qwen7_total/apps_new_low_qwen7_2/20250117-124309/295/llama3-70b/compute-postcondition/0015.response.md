The code sets `f` to `True`. The value of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 12, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and `f` is `True`.

Output State: **`i` is 12, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and `f` is `True`**
