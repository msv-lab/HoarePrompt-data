The code snippet assigns `True` to the variable `f`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or the array `a`. Therefore, the only change is that `f` is now `True`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and for all \(j\) in the range of \(0 \leq j < n\), \(a[j] = b[(i + j) \% 12]\); `f` is `True`.**
