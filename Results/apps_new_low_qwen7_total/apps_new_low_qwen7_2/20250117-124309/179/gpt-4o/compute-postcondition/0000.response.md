The initial state is defined as follows:
- `n` is an integer such that \(13 \leq n < 10^5\) and `n` is odd.
- `s` is a string consisting of `n` digits.

Let's analyze the code block step by step:

1. `n = int(input().strip())`: This line reads an integer from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to `n`.

2. `s = input().strip()`: This line reads a string from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to `s`.

3. `moves = (n - 11) // 2`: This line calculates the number of moves by performing integer division of `(n - 11)` by 2. The result is stored in the variable `moves`.

4. `count_8 = s[:n - 11].count('8')`: This line counts the occurrences of the digit '8' in the substring of `s` from the beginning up to the index `n - 11` (not inclusive). The count is stored in the variable `count_8`.

After executing these lines, the updated state includes:
- `n` is the integer value read from the input.
- `s` is the string read from the input.
- `moves` is the result of `(n - 11) // 2`.
- `count_8` is the count of '8' in the specified substring of `s`.

The final output state is:

Output State: **n is the integer read from the input, s is the string read from the input, moves is (n - 11) // 2, count_8 is the count of '8' in the substring s[:n - 11]**
