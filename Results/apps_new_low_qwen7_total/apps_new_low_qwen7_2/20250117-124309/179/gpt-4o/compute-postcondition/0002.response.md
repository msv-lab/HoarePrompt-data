The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not affect any variable values. The precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input, `moves` is equal to (n - 11) // 2, `count_8` is the count of '8' in the substring s[:n - 11], and the print statement outputs 'YES'**
