You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A telephone number is a sequence of exactly $11$ digits such that its first digit is 8.

Vasya and Petya are playing a game. Initially they have a string $s$ of length $n$ ($n$ is odd) consisting of digits. Vasya makes the first move, then players alternate turns. In one move the player must choose a character and erase it from the current string. For example, if the current string 1121, after the player's move it may be 112, 111 or 121. The game ends when the length of string $s$ becomes 11. If the resulting string is a telephone number, Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.

You have to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy (that is, if Vasya can win the game no matter which characters Petya chooses during his moves).


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($13 \le n < 10^5$, $n$ is odd) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting only of decimal digits.


-----Output-----

If Vasya has a strategy that guarantees him victory, print YES.

Otherwise print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
8380011223344

Output
YES

Input
15
807345619350641

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Vasya needs to erase the second character. Then Petya cannot erase a character from the remaining string 880011223344 so that it does not become a telephone number.

In the second example after Vasya's turn Petya can erase one character character 8. The resulting string can't be a telephone number, because there is no digit 8 at all.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input().strip())
    s = input().strip()
    moves = (n - 11) // 2
    count_8 = s[:n - 11].count('8')
    if count_8 > moves:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `n` (where 13 ≤ n < 10^5 and n is odd) and a string `s` consisting of `n` digits as input. It then calculates the number of moves required based on `n`, which is given by `(n - 11) // 2`. The function counts the occurrences of the digit '8' in the substring of `s` starting from the beginning up to the index `n - 11`. Depending on whether the count of '8's is greater than the calculated number of moves, the function prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. An edge case to consider is when `n` is exactly 13, in which case the substring `s[:n - 11]` would be empty, resulting in `count_8` being 0. Another edge case is when `n` approaches 10^5, the calculation of `moves` should ensure it remains within the valid range. The function does not handle invalid inputs or non-digit characters in the string `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Rules**:
   - Vasya and Petya play a game where they take turns removing characters from a string until the string is of length 11.
   - The final string must start with '8' to be a telephone number for Vasya to win.
   - Vasya starts first, and the number of moves is \((n - 11) / 2\), where \(n\) is the initial length of the string.

2. **Key Points**:
   - Vasya wins if he can ensure that after all moves, the resulting string starts with '8'.
   - To guarantee a win, Vasya needs to ensure that there are more than \((n - 11) / 2\) occurrences of '8' in the initial string before the game starts. This way, Vasya can always strategically remove non-'8' characters and leave at least one '8' in the first position of the final string.

3. **Checking the Condition**:
   - The code correctly calculates the number of moves required: \((n - 11) // 2\).
   - It then counts the number of '8's in the initial substring of length \(n - 11\): `s[:n - 11].count('8')`.
   - If this count is greater than the number of moves, Vasya can always win because he will have enough '8's to ensure the final string starts with '8'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles cases where there are enough '8's to ensure Vasya can win.
   - It also correctly handles cases where there are not enough '8's, ensuring Petya wins.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy. Therefore, the provided function is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
