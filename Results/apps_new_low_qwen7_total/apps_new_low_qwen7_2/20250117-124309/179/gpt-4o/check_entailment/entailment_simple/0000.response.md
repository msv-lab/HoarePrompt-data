### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy to ensure the final string is a valid phone number (i.e., 11 digits starting with '8').

2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Vasya and Petya take turns removing a character from the string until the string length is 11.
   - Vasya wins if the final string is a valid phone number; otherwise, Petya wins.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - To form a valid phone number, the string must end with exactly 11 characters.
   - Vasya starts and can always remove a character, reducing the string length by 1 each turn.
   - Petya also removes a character each turn.

4. **Counting '8'**:
   - The critical observation is the count of '8' in the initial substring `s[:n - 11]`.
   - Each removal of a character reduces the count of '8' and the length of the string.
   - Vasya needs at least one '8' left in the final 11 characters for the string to be a valid phone number.

5. **Calculating Moves**:
   - The number of moves required to reduce the string from length `n` to 11 is `(n - 11) // 2`.
   - Vasya and Petya together make these moves, but Vasya goes first.

6. **Strategy Analysis**:
   - If `count_8` (the number of '8's in the first `n - 11` characters) is greater than the number of moves `moves`, Vasya can always ensure there will be at least one '8' left in the final 11 characters.
   - Otherwise, Petya can always prevent the final string from containing an '8'.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy by checking if the number of '8's in the initial part of the string is sufficient to ensure the final string contains an '8'.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the provided logic and the problem description.
