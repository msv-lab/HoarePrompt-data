### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Rules**:
   - Vasya and Petya play a game where they take turns removing characters from a string until the string is of length 11.
   - The final string must start with '8' to be a telephone number for Vasya to win.
   - Vasya starts first, and the number of moves is \((n - 11) / 2\), where \(n\) is the initial length of the string.

2. **Key Points**:
   - Vasya wins if he can ensure that after all moves, the resulting string starts with '8'.
   - To guarantee a win, Vasya needs to ensure that there are more than \((n - 11) / 2\) occurrences of '8' in the initial string before the game starts. This way, Vasya can always strategically remove non-'8' characters and leave at least one '8' in the first position of the final string.

3. **Checking the Condition**:
   - The code correctly calculates the number of moves required: \((n - 11) // 2\).
   - It then counts the number of '8's in the initial substring of length \(n - 11\): `s[:n - 11].count('8')`.
   - If this count is greater than the number of moves, Vasya can always win because he will have enough '8's to ensure the final string starts with '8'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles cases where there are enough '8's to ensure Vasya can win.
   - It also correctly handles cases where there are not enough '8's, ensuring Petya wins.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy. Therefore, the provided function is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
