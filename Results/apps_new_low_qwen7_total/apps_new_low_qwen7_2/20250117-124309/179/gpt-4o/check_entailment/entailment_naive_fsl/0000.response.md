Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if Vasya has a winning strategy based on the given rules. It calculates the number of moves needed to reach the final length of 11 and counts how many '8's are present in the initial part of the string that will be removed. If the number of '8's is greater than the number of moves, Vasya can always ensure that at least one '8' remains in the final string, making it a valid telephone number.

The logic is sound:
1. Calculate the number of moves needed to reduce the string length to 11.
2. Count the number of '8's in the initial part of the string that will be removed.
3. Check if the number of '8's is greater than the number of moves.

This ensures that Vasya can always leave at least one '8' in the final string, guaranteeing a win. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where this logic fails based on the problem description and the given examples.
