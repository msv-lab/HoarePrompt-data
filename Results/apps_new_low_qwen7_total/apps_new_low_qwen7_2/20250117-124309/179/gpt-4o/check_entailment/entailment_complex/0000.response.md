Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Vasya can always win the game by ensuring that the final string is a valid telephone number (i.e., starts with '8' and has exactly 11 digits).
2. The approach taken in the program is to calculate the number of moves needed to reduce the string to 11 characters, which is \((n - 11) // 2\). This is correct since both players alternate moves and the initial string length \(n\) is odd.
3. The program then counts the number of '8's in the substring of the initial string that will remain after removing the last 11 characters. This count is compared with the number of moves to determine if Vasya can guarantee a win.
4. If the count of '8's in the substring is greater than the number of moves, Vasya can always pick an '8' on his turn to ensure that the final string starts with '8', thus winning the game.
5. The logic handles the edge case where \(n\) is exactly 13 by correctly counting the '8's in an empty substring, resulting in `count_8` being 0.
6. The program does not explicitly check for non-digit characters in the string, but this is not necessary as the problem assumes valid inputs.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
