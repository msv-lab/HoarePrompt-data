Reasoning:  
The given program aims to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy in the described game. To analyze the correctness of the program, let's break down the logic and assumptions:

1. **Input Validation**: The program assumes valid inputs, specifically that `n` is odd and between 13 and \(10^5\), and that the string `s` consists only of digits.
2. **Number of Moves Calculation**: The variable `moves` is correctly calculated as \((n - 11) // 2\). This represents the maximum number of moves allowed before the string is reduced to 11 characters.
3. **Count of '8' Digits**: The program counts the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n - 11]`. This is the critical part of the logic because:
   - If there are more '8's than the number of moves, Vasya can always make sure that an '8' remains in the final 11-character string, ensuring a win.
   - Otherwise, Petya can prevent any '8' from remaining, leading to a loss for Vasya.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy. The edge cases, such as when `n` is exactly 13 or very close to \(10^5\), are handled appropriately by the integer division used to calculate `moves`.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the given execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
