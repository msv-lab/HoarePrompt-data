You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.

- Program: 
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5.
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())

dp = [0] * (m + 1)

dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `m`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^5, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^5, `dp` is a list of length `m+1` where all elements are 0 except `dp[0]` which is 1.
    print(sum(dp))



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To solve the given problem, we need to ensure that the frog can reach each integer from 0 to `m` and count the number of distinct integers it can reach for each value of `i` from 0 to `m`. The provided solution uses dynamic programming (DP) to achieve this.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with zeros.
   - `dp[0]` is set to 1 because the frog starts at position 0.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each position `i` from 0 to `m`, the frog can jump to `i + a` or `i - b`.
   - If `i + a` is within the range `[0, m]`, it updates `dp[i + a]` by adding `dp[i]` to it.
   - If `i - b` is non-negative, it updates `dp[i]` by adding `dp[i - b]` to it.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The final result is the sum of all elements in the DP array `dp`.

### Verification:

- **Example 1**: 
  - Given: `m = 7`, `a = 5`, `b = 3`
  - The reachable positions are calculated step-by-step:
    - `dp[0] = 1`
    - `dp[5] = dp[0] + dp[5-3] = 1 + 1 = 2` (since `dp[2] = 1`)
    - `dp[8] = dp[5] + dp[5-3] = 2 + 1 = 3` (but 8 is out of range, so not considered)
    - `dp[2] = dp[5-3] = 1`
    - `dp[6] = dp[5] + dp[5-3] = 2 + 1 = 3`
    - `dp[3] = dp[5-3] = 1`
    - `dp[4] = dp[5-3] = 1`
    - `dp[7] = dp[5] + dp[5-3] = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - Final DP array: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15`, but there seems to be an error since the answer should be `19`. Let's recheck the logic.

- **Example 2**: 
  - Given: `m = 10^9`, `a = 1`, `b = 2019`
  - The frog can reach every integer from 0 to `m` because `a = 1` allows it to cover all integers.
  - `dp[i] = i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `m`.
  - Sum: `\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} (i + 1) = \frac{(10^9)(10^9 + 1)}{2} + 10^9 + 1 = 500000001500000001`

- **Example 3**: 
  - Given: `m = 100`, `a = 100000`, `b = 1`
  - Since `a` is very large, the frog can only stay at `0` and `-1` (if considering negative positions).
  - `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 1`, and no other positions are reachable.
  - Sum: `1 + 1 = 2`, but the expected output is `101`.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly implements the DP approach and handles the transitions properly. However, there was an error in the explanation for Example 1, and the output for Example 3 was incorrect due to the large `a` value. The solution needs a more detailed check for edge cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The solution is almost correct but requires a thorough validation of edge cases, especially when `a` is very large.
