You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.

- Program:
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads three integers \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\) from input, where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It then constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` of length \(m+1\) initialized to zero, with `dp[0]` set to 1. For each index `i` from 0 to \(m\), it updates `dp[i+a]` and `dp[i-b]` if the indices are within bounds. After completing the loop, it prints the sum of all elements in the `dp` array. The function effectively computes a modified version of a knapsack problem where it counts the number of ways to reach each index in the array by adding `a` or subtracting `b` from previous indices. The final state of the program is that the sum of the `dp` array is printed, representing the total count of valid paths. Edge cases include the possibility of negative indices when subtracting `b`, which are handled by setting `dp[i]` to `dp[i-b]` only if `i - b` is non-negative.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Update Logic**: The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is problematic because it incorrectly updates the value at index `i` when jumping from `i - b`. This can lead to double-counting or missing certain reachable positions. Specifically, if `i - b` was previously updated, adding `dp[i - b]` to `dp[i]` might cause incorrect increments.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, if `a` and `b` are such that they can form a loop or if `b` is larger than `a`, the current logic might miss certain reachable positions.

To illustrate, consider the input `7 5 3`:
- Starting from 0, the frog can reach positions 5 and 2 (0 -> 5 -> 2).
- The current implementation might incorrectly update the DP array, leading to incorrect counts for `f(5)` and `f(6)`.

A corrected approach would involve maintaining a set of reachable positions and ensuring no duplicates are added. Here's a revised version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    reachable = {0}
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            reachable.add(i + a)
        if i - b >= 0:
            reachable.add(i - b)
    result = sum(len(reachable & set(range(i + 1))) for i in range(m + 1))
    print(result)

func()
```

This version explicitly tracks reachable positions and ensures correct counts for each `f(i)`.
