### Reasoning:

To solve the given problem, we need to ensure that the frog can reach each integer from 0 to `m` and count the number of distinct integers it can reach for each value of `i` from 0 to `m`. The provided solution uses dynamic programming (DP) to achieve this.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with zeros.
   - `dp[0]` is set to 1 because the frog starts at position 0.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each position `i` from 0 to `m`, the frog can jump to `i + a` or `i - b`.
   - If `i + a` is within the range `[0, m]`, it updates `dp[i + a]` by adding `dp[i]` to it.
   - If `i - b` is non-negative, it updates `dp[i]` by adding `dp[i - b]` to it.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The final result is the sum of all elements in the DP array `dp`.

### Verification:

- **Example 1**: 
  - Given: `m = 7`, `a = 5`, `b = 3`
  - The reachable positions are calculated step-by-step:
    - `dp[0] = 1`
    - `dp[5] = dp[0] + dp[5-3] = 1 + 1 = 2` (since `dp[2] = 1`)
    - `dp[8] = dp[5] + dp[5-3] = 2 + 1 = 3` (but 8 is out of range, so not considered)
    - `dp[2] = dp[5-3] = 1`
    - `dp[6] = dp[5] + dp[5-3] = 2 + 1 = 3`
    - `dp[3] = dp[5-3] = 1`
    - `dp[4] = dp[5-3] = 1`
    - `dp[7] = dp[5] + dp[5-3] = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - Final DP array: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15`, but there seems to be an error since the answer should be `19`. Let's recheck the logic.

- **Example 2**: 
  - Given: `m = 10^9`, `a = 1`, `b = 2019`
  - The frog can reach every integer from 0 to `m` because `a = 1` allows it to cover all integers.
  - `dp[i] = i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `m`.
  - Sum: `\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} (i + 1) = \frac{(10^9)(10^9 + 1)}{2} + 10^9 + 1 = 500000001500000001`

- **Example 3**: 
  - Given: `m = 100`, `a = 100000`, `b = 1`
  - Since `a` is very large, the frog can only stay at `0` and `-1` (if considering negative positions).
  - `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 1`, and no other positions are reachable.
  - Sum: `1 + 1 = 2`, but the expected output is `101`.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly implements the DP approach and handles the transitions properly. However, there was an error in the explanation for Example 1, and the output for Example 3 was incorrect due to the large `a` value. The solution needs a more detailed check for edge cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The solution is almost correct but requires a thorough validation of edge cases, especially when `a` is very large.
