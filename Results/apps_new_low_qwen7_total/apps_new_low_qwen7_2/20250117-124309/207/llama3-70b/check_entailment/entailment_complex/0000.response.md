Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming. Let's analyze its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The `dp` array is correctly initialized with `dp[0] = 1`, indicating that there's one way to stay at position 0 (starting point).

2. **DP Transition**: 
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `m`, it tries to update `dp[i + a]` and `dp[i - b]` if the indices are within bounds.
   - This ensures that the number of ways to reach each position is updated correctly based on the number of ways to reach the previous positions.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `i - b < 0`, it does not update `dp[i]` with `dp[i - b]`. This is correct because the frog cannot jump to a negative position.
   - Similarly, when `i + a > m`, no update is done to `dp[i + a]`, which is also correct as jumping beyond `m` is not allowed.

4. **Final Output**: The program sums up all the values in the `dp` array and prints the result, which is the total number of distinct integers the frog can reach from 0 up to `m`.

However, the annotated program is missing some crucial parts:
- The annotated program does not mention that the `dp` array should actually store the number of distinct positions reachable from 0 up to the current index, rather than the number of ways to reach each position.
- The logic to calculate the number of distinct integers reachable (`f(i)`) is not fully implemented. The provided code only updates the `dp` array but does not ensure that each position is counted only once.

To correct the program, we need to ensure that each position is counted only once in the `dp` array, and then sum up the values from 0 to `m`.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:
```python
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    visited = [False] * (m + 1)
    visited[0] = True
    
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if visited[i]:
            continue
        dp[i] = 1
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
            visited[i + a] = True
        
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
            visited[i - b] = True
    
    print(sum(dp))
```

Given the provided analysis and the need to ensure each position is counted only once, the original program is **not** entirely correct. However, based on the provided code, the logic seems mostly correct with minor adjustments needed.

Correctness: **False**
