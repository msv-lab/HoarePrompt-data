Reasoning:  
The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by using a dynamic programming approach. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a list `dp` of length \(m+1\) with all elements set to 0. This list is used to keep track of the number of distinct positions reachable up to each index.
2. **Base Case**: `dp[0]` is set to 1, indicating that the frog can start at position 0.
3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: For each index `i` from 0 to \(m\):
   - If `i + a` is within bounds, `dp[i + a]` is updated by adding `dp[i]`.
   - If `i - b` is non-negative (i.e., greater than or equal to 0), `dp[i]` is updated by adding `dp[i - b]`.
4. **Result Calculation**: After the loop completes, the program prints the sum of all elements in the `dp` array.

This approach ensures that each position from 0 to \(m\) is considered and the number of ways to reach each position is correctly accumulated.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the solution, the program correctly implements the required logic. It handles the edge cases of moving backwards by ensuring that only valid indices (non-negative) are considered.

Correctness: **True**
