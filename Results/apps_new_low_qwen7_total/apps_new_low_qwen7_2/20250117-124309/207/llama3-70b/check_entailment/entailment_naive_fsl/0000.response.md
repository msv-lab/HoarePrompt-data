Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Update Logic**: The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is problematic because it incorrectly updates the value at index `i` when jumping from `i - b`. This can lead to double-counting or missing certain reachable positions. Specifically, if `i - b` was previously updated, adding `dp[i - b]` to `dp[i]` might cause incorrect increments.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, if `a` and `b` are such that they can form a loop or if `b` is larger than `a`, the current logic might miss certain reachable positions.

To illustrate, consider the input `7 5 3`:
- Starting from 0, the frog can reach positions 5 and 2 (0 -> 5 -> 2).
- The current implementation might incorrectly update the DP array, leading to incorrect counts for `f(5)` and `f(6)`.

A corrected approach would involve maintaining a set of reachable positions and ensuring no duplicates are added. Here's a revised version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    reachable = {0}
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            reachable.add(i + a)
        if i - b >= 0:
            reachable.add(i - b)
    result = sum(len(reachable & set(range(i + 1))) for i in range(m + 1))
    print(result)

func()
```

This version explicitly tracks reachable positions and ensures correct counts for each `f(i)`.
