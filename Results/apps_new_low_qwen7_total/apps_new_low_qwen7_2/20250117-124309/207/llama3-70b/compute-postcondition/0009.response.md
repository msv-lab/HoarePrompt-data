The code updates `dp[i + a]` by adding the value of `dp[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, and `dp[0]` remains unchanged. The value of `dp[i + a]` is updated based on the current value of `dp[i]`. Since `i` is 1, `i + a` would be `1 + a`, and `dp[i + a]` is updated by adding `dp[i]` (which is `dp[1]`).

Therefore, the value of `dp[1 + a]` is now `dp[1] + dp[1] = 2 * dp[1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `dp[0]` remains unchanged, and `dp[1 + a]` is updated to `2 * dp[1]`.**
