The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `m` remains unchanged because the loop condition is based on `i` being less than or equal to `m`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, and `dp[0]` remains unchanged. If `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i]` is updated to include `dp[i - b]`. Otherwise, no changes occur in `dp[i]`.**
