`dp[i + a]` is assigned the value of `dp[i]` plus the current value at `dp[i + a]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, and the sum of `i` and `a` is less than or equal to `m`, the updated state of `i` remains 0 because the code does not change its value. The value of `m` also remains unchanged since it is only a condition and not a variable being modified. Therefore, the output state is `i` is 0; `m` must be at least 1; and `dp[i + a]` is updated to include `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `m` must be at least 1; `dp[i + a]` is updated to include `dp[i]`.**
