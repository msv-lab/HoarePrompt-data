Functionality: **The function reads three integers \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\) from input, where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It then constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` of length \(m+1\) initialized to zero, with `dp[0]` set to 1. For each index `i` from 0 to \(m\), it updates `dp[i+a]` and `dp[i-b]` if the indices are within bounds. After completing the loop, it prints the sum of all elements in the `dp` array. The function effectively computes a modified version of a knapsack problem where it counts the number of ways to reach each index in the array by adding `a` or subtracting `b` from previous indices. The final state of the program is that the sum of the `dp` array is printed, representing the total count of valid paths. Edge cases include the possibility of negative indices when subtracting `b`, which are handled by setting `dp[i]` to `dp[i-b]` only if `i - b` is non-negative.**
