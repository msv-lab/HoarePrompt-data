The code updates `dp[i]` by adding `dp[i - b]` to it. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `m` is at least 1, the condition `(i + a) <= m` is not met within the if statement, meaning the if statement does not execute, and thus `dp[i]` is not updated. Therefore, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `dp[0]` is unchanged**
