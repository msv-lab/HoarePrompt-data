The initial state is defined as follows:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\).
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).

The code snippet provided is:
```python
m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
dp = [0] * (m + 1)
dp[0] = 1
```

Let's analyze each line:
1. `m, a, b = map(int, input().split())`: This line reads three space-separated integers from standard input and assigns them to `m`, `a`, and `b` respectively. Since these values are read from input, we do not know their exact values at this point, but we know they are within the specified ranges.
2. `dp = [0] * (m + 1)`: This line initializes a list `dp` of length `m + 1` with all elements set to 0.
3. `dp[0] = 1`: This line sets the first element of the `dp` list to 1.

After executing these lines, the following state is updated:
- The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the input.
- A list `dp` is created with length `m + 1` where all elements are initialized to 0, and the first element `dp[0]` is set to 1.

Since the values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are dependent on user input and cannot be specified without additional input, we will keep them as symbolic placeholders within the ranges provided.

Final Output State: **m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, a is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^5, b is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^5, dp is a list of length m+1 where all elements are 0 except dp[0] which is 1**
