The function `func` does not accept any parameters, but it has constraints on the parameters `m`, `a`, and `b` described in the problem statement. Given these constraints, the function will operate under certain conditions but since the function signature provided does not include these parameters, we focus on the described behavior.

Case_1: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). The function returns an integer value based on some unspecified logic involving `m`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates under constraints where `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\), and returns an integer based on these parameters.**
