The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `meats`, `K`, and `T`. 

- `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of the i-th piece of meat.
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats).
- `T` is an integer.

The function has multiple return points:
- Cases 1 through 9 all return True.
- Case 10 returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of meat pieces with their coordinates and hardness, an integer `K` within the bounds of the list length, and an integer `T`. The function then returns True in cases 1 through 9 and returns False in case 10.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of meat pieces (`meats`), an integer `K` within the bounds of the list length, and an integer `T`. It returns True in cases 1 through 9 and returns False in case 10.**
