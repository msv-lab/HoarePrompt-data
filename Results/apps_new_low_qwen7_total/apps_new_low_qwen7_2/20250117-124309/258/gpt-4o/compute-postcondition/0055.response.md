Postcondition: ***`i` is N, `j` is undefined, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is undefined, `y2` is undefined, `c2` is undefined, and `d` is a negative value equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Since the condition `d < 0` is true, the postcondition remains as the same as the precondition.***
