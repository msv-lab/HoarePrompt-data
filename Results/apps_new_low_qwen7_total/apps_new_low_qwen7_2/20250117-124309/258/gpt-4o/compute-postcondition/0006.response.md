Output State: **data is unchanged, index is index + 3, meats is a list containing one additional tuple (x, y, c) where x, y, and c are integers extracted from the data at indices index-3, index-2, and index-1 respectively**

Explanation:
1. The first line sets `x` to the integer value of `data[index]`. Here, `index` is `i0 + 3 * (k + 1)`.
2. The second line sets `y` to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
3. The third line sets `c` to the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
4. The fourth line appends the tuple `(x, y, c)` to the `meats` list.
5. The fifth line increments `index` by 3.

After these operations, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is updated to `index + 3`, and `meats` now contains an additional tuple `(x, y, c)` where `x`, `y`, and `c` are the integers extracted from `data` at the indices `index-3`, `index-2`, and `index-1` respectively.
