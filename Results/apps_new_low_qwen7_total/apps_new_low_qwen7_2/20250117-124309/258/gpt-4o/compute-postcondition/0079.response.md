The code swaps the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` with `x2`, `y2`, `c2`. This means that `x1` now holds the value of `x2`, `y1` now holds the value of `y2`, and `c1` now holds the value of `c2`. Simultaneously, `x2` now holds the value of the original `x1`, `y2` holds the value of the original `y1`, and `c2` holds the value of the original `c1`.

Output State: **`x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `original x1`, `y2` is `original y1`, `c2` is `original c1`**
