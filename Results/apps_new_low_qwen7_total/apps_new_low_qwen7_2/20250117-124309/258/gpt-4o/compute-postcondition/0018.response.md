Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), `K` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\), `low` and `high` are such that `high - low <= 1e-07`. `mid` is the average value of `low` and `high` just before exiting the loop.**

### Analysis:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop continues until `high - low` is less than or equal to \(10^{-7}\).
   - `mid` is calculated as the midpoint between `low` and `high`.
   - If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns `True`, then `high` is updated to `mid`.
   - If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns `False`, then `low` is updated to `mid`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `meats` and `K` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - `low` and `high` change based on the condition of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`.
   - `mid` is recalculated in each iteration but does not persist outside the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop narrows down the range between `low` and `high` iteratively.
   - Each iteration sets `high` to `mid` if `func_1` returns `True`, or sets `low` to `mid` if `func_1` returns `False`.
   - The loop continues until the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to \(10^{-7}\).

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The conditions described ensure that `high - low` will eventually become less than or equal to \(10^{-7}\).
   - The final values of `low` and `high` will be within \(10^{-7}\) of each other.

Thus, after the loop completes, the final values of `low` and `high` satisfy `high - low <= 1e-07`, and `mid` is the average of `low` and `high` just before exiting the loop.
