The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is N, `j` is N + 2, `x1` is x2, `y1` is y2, `c1` is c2, `x2` is x1, `y2` is y1, `c2` is c1, `d` is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), `cx` is (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is (x1 - x2)**
