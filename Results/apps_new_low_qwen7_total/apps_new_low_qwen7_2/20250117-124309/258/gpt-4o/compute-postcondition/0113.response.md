`d` is assigned the value of `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Given that `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, the conditions for swapping variables are met, leading to the following updates: `x1` is set to `x2`, `y1` is set to `y2`, `c1` is set to `c2`, `x2` is set to `x1`, `y2` is set to `y1`, and `c2` is set to `c1`. The value of `d` is calculated as `c1 * T - c2 * T`.

Output State: **`i` is `N`, `j` is `N + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `x1`, `y2` is `y1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`**
