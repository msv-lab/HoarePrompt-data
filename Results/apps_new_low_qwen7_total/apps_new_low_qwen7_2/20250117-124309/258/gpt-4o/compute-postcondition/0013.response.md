Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head is `while high - low > 1e-07:`. Therefore, the variables that determine whether the loop can execute again are `high` and `low`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop continues as long as `high - low > 1e-07`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the difference between `high` and `low` must still be greater than `1e-07`.

3. **Determine the Required Adjustments:**
   - Since `high` and `low` are updated based on the result of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`, we need to ensure that the condition `high - low > 1e-07` is satisfied.
   - The value of `mid` is always updated to \((low + high) / 2\), but this does not affect the loop condition directly. Instead, it affects how `low` and `high` are updated.

Given the initial conditions:
- `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\)
- `K` is a positive integer
- `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\)
- `low` and `high` are updated according to the result of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the only variables we can adjust are `low` and `high`. We need to ensure that `high - low > 1e-07`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), `K` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\), `low` and `high` are such that `high - low > 1e-07`**.
