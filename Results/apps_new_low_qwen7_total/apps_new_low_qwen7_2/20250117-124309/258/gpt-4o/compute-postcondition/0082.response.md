The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed with the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the flow of the program. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x1` is `x2` if `c1 * T` < `c2 * T` and `x1` otherwise, `y1` is `y2` if `c1 * T` < `c2 * T` and `y1` otherwise, `c1` is `c2` if `c1 * T` < `c2 * T` and `c1` otherwise; `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`**
