Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head**: The loop uses `range(N)`, so the key variables involved in controlling the loop's execution are `N` and the loop variable `_`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `N` is greater than 0. Since the loop uses `range(N)`, the loop will iterate `N` times, starting from 0 up to `N-1`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is:
   - `N` is a positive integer.
   - `K` is a positive integer such that `1 <= K <= N`.
   - `meats` is an empty list.
   - `index` is 2.

4. **Loop Initialization**: When the loop starts, the value of the loop variable `_` is set to 0 (since `range(N)` generates values from 0 to `N-1`).

5. **Condition for First Iteration**: For the loop to execute its first time, `N` must be greater than 0. Additionally, since we are iterating using `range(N)`, the first value of `_` will be 0, which is valid.

Given this analysis, the state needed for the loop to execute the first time is:
- `N` must be greater than 0.
- The loop variable `_` will be 0 initially.

Since `K` and `meats` and `index` are not directly involved in the loop's condition, they do not need to be modified for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
