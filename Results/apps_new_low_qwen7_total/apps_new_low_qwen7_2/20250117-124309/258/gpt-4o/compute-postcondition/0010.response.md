Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, which represent the number of pieces of meat (N), a positive integer K, and the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of each piece of meat. It then calls `func_2` with these parameters. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. The function ensures that N and K are positive integers with 1 <= K <= N <= 60, and that the input data is correctly parsed into the `meats` list. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats or values that do not meet the specified constraints. If the input does not conform to the expected format or constraints, the function will not produce meaningful output.**
