The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified in the given code snippet and no changes are made to any variables when using `continue`, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is N, `j` is N + 2, `x1` is the value at index i of meats, `y1` is the value at index i+1 of meats, `c1` is the value at index i+2 of meats, `x2` is the value at index j of meats, `y2` is the value at index j+1 of meats, `c2` is the value at index j+2 of meats, `d` is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), `cx` is (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is ((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2**
