The code snippet swaps the values of `(x1, y1, c1)` with `(x2, y2, c2)`. Given the initial conditions, we know the following:

- `i` is N (unchanged)
- `j` is undefined (unchanged)
- `x1` is undefined (will be swapped with `x2`)
- `y1` is undefined (will be swapped with `y2`)
- `c1` is undefined (will be swapped with `c2`)
- `x2` is undefined (will now hold the original value of `x1`)
- `y2` is undefined (will now hold the original value of `y1`)
- `c2` is undefined (will now hold the original value of `c1`)
- The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is true (now `c2 * T < c1 * T`)

After the swap, the new states are:
- `x1` is equal to the original value of `x2`
- `y1` is equal to the original value of `y2`
- `c1` is equal to the original value of `c2`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is N, `j` is undefined, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is undefined, `y2` is undefined, `c2` is undefined, and the condition `c2 * T < c1 * T` is true**
