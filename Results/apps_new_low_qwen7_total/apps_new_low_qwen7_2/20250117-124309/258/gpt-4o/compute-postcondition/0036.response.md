The code assigns the value of `c1 * T - c2 * T` to `d`. Since `T` is not defined, the expression `c1 * T - c2 * T` remains as it is. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `meats` remains unchanged, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `mx` remains undefined, `my` remains undefined, `count` remains undefined.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `meats` remains unchanged, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `mx` remains undefined, `my` remains undefined, `count` remains undefined.**
