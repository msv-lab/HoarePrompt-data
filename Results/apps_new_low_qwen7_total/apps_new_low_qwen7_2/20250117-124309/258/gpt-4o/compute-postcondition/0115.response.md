Postcondition: ***`i` is `N`, `j` is `N + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `x1`, `y2` is `y1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`. If `d < 0`, then the value of `d` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the state of the variables does not change regardless of the condition.***
