The code updates the value of `d` to `(c1 * T - c2 * T)`. This means that `d` is now directly equal to this expression, and no other variables are affected by this line of code.

Since `c1 * T` and `c2 * T` are known values, we can simplify the expression for `d`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `c1` is the value at index `i+2` of `meats`
- `c2` is the value at index `j+2` of `meats`

The output state is:

Output State: **`i` is N, `j` is N + 2, `x1` is the value at index `i` of `meats`, `y1` is the value at index `i+1` of `meats`, `c1` is the value at index `i+2` of `meats`, `x2` is the value at index `j` of `meats`, `y2` is the value at index `j+1` of `meats`, `c2` is the value at index `j+2` of `meats`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T)`, `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(x1 - x2\). If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is the value at index `j` of `meats`, `y1` is the value at index `j+1` of `meats`, `c1` is the value at index `j+2` of `meats`, `x2` is the value at index `i` of `meats`, `y2` is the value at index `i+1` of `meats`, `c2` is the value at index `i+2` of `meats`.**
