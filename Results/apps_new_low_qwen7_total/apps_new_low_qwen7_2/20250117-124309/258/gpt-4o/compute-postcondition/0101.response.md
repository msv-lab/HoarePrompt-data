Output State: **i is N, j is N + 1, x1 is the x-coordinate of the meat at index N + 1, y1 is the y-coordinate of the meat at index N + 1, c1 is the x-coordinate of the meat at index N if c1 * T >= c2 * T else x2, c2 is the y-coordinate of the meat at index N + 1 if c1 * T >= c2 * T else y1, d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is dx * dx + dy * dx**

Explanation:
1. `d /= c1 * c2`: This line divides `d` by `c1 * c2`, updating `d` to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
2. `cx = (x1 + x2) / 2`: This line calculates the average x-coordinate between `x1` and `x2` and assigns it to `cx`.
3. `cy = (y1 + y2) / 2`: This line calculates the average y-coordinate between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `cy`.
4. `dx = (x1 - x2) / 2`: This line calculates half the difference in x-coordinates between `x1` and `x2` and assigns it to `dx`.
5. `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2`: This line calculates half the difference in y-coordinates between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `dy`.
6. `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy`: This line calculates the squared distance between points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` using the formula `dx^2 + dy^2` and assigns it to `d2`.

Note: The values of `x2` and `y2` are not provided or modified in the given code, so they remain unchanged.
