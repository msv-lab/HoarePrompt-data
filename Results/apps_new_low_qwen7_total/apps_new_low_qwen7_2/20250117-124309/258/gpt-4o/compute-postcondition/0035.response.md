Postcondition: **i is 0, j is 2, meats remains unchanged, x1 is the original value of x2, y1 is the original value of y2, c1 is the original value of c2, x2 is the original value of x1, y2 is the original value of y1, c2 is the original value of c1, d is undefined, mx is undefined, my is undefined, count is undefined. The condition c1 * T < c2 * T is checked, and if true, the program remains in the same state as the precondition. If false, the program also remains in the same state as the precondition.**
