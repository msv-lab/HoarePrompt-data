The code sets `high` to the value of `mid`. Since `mid = (low + high) / 2`, after executing `high = mid`, the value of `high` will be `(low + high) / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), `K` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\), `low` and `high` are such that `high - low > 1e-07`, `high` is now equal to \((low + high) / 2\)**
