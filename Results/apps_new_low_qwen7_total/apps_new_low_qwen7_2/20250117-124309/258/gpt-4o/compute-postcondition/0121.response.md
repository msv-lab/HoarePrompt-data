Postcondition: ***`i` is `N`, `j` is `N + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `x1`, `y2` is `y1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c2 * c1)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `x1 - x2`. The function returns `True` if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, otherwise, the program does not change any of the values and continues execution without returning anything.***
