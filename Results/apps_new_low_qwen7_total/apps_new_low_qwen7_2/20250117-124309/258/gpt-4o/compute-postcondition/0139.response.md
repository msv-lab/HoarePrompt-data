Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of meat pieces represented as tuples containing coordinates and hardness, an integer `K`, and an integer `T`. It iterates through all pairs of meat pieces and checks if the hardness difference scaled by `T` can be used to transform one meat piece into another in a way that satisfies the condition `count >= K`, where `count` is the number of meat pieces whose distance from a calculated point `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`. If such a transformation is found, the function returns `True`. If no such transformation exists after checking all pairs, the function returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `meats` is empty or `K` is zero, in which case the function should return `False`. The function does not modify the `meats` list.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
- Iterates through all pairs of meat pieces.
- Checks if the hardness difference scaled by `T` allows swapping the hardness values of the two pieces.
- Calculates the center point `(cx, cy)` and the offset `(dx, dy)` between the two pieces.
- Computes the squared distance `d2` between the two pieces.
- Checks if the calculated point `(mx, my)` lies within the specified distance `T` for at least `K` meat pieces.
- Returns `True` if such a condition is met; otherwise, it continues checking other pairs or returns `False` if no valid pair is found.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `meats` is an empty list, the function should return `False`.
- If `K` is zero, the function should also return `False` since no meat pieces need to satisfy the condition.
