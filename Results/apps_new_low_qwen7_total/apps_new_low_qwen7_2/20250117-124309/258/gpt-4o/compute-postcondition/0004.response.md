Output State: **data is unchanged, index is index + 3, meats is a list containing a tuple (x, y, c) where x, y, and c are integers extracted from data at index, index + 1, and index + 2 respectively**

Explanation:
- The first line converts the value at `data[index]` to an integer and assigns it to `x`.
- The second line converts the value at `data[index + 1]` to an integer and assigns it to `y`.
- The third line converts the value at `data[index + 2]` to an integer and assigns it to `c`.
- The fourth line appends a tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`.
- The fifth line increments `index` by 3, moving the index past the three values just processed.
- The initial state condition that `N` must be greater than 0 is not directly impacted by the given code block, so it remains valid but unspecified in the output state.
