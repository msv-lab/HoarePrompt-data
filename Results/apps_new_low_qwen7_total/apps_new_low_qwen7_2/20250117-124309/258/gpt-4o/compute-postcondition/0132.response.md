Output State: **i is N, j is N + 2, x1 is the value at index i of meats, y1 is the value at index i+1 of meats, c1 is the value at index i+2 of meats, x2 is the value at index j of meats, y2 is the value at index j+1 of meats, c2 is the value at index j+2 of meats, d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is ((x1 - x2) / 2)**2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)**2, mx is cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, my is cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, count is the number of elements in meats that satisfy the condition (c * sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T)**

Explanation:
1. The values of `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` remain unchanged as they are not reassigned or used in subsequent calculations.
2. The value of `d` is calculated as `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
3. The values of `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, and `dy` are calculated based on the formulas provided.
4. `d2` is calculated as `((x1 - x2) / 2)**2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)**2`.
5. The value of `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
6. The value of `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
7. The value of `count` is calculated as the sum of `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T` for each element `(x, y, c)` in `meats`.

Note: The actual numerical values for `mx`, `my`, and `count` depend on the specific values of `meats`, `T`, `N`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`.
