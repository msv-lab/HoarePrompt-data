The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and `index` is incremented by 3. For the loop to execute again, `N` must still be greater than 0.

Since `_` is used as a dummy variable and is always set to 0 in the loop, it does not affect the loop condition. The key is to ensure that `N` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`N` must be greater than 0**
