The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, and the variables are not being modified within the context of a loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables directly listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `N`, `j` is `N + 1`, `x1` is the x-coordinate of the meat at index `N + 1`, `y1` is the y-coordinate of the meat at index `N + 1`, `c1` is the x-coordinate of the meat at index `N` if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` else `x2`, `c2` is the y-coordinate of the meat at index `N + 1` if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` else `y1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T` and the value of `d` is less than 0.**
