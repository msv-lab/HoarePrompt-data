The code calculates the midpoint between `low` and `high` and assigns it to `mid`. This does not affect the values of `N`, `K`, `meats`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), `K` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\), `low` and `high` are such that `high - low > 1e-07`, `mid = (low + high) / 2`**
