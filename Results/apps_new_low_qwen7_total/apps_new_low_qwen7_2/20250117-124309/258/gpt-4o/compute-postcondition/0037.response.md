The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop context is provided, the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables outside of a loop. Therefore, the values of all the variables stay the same.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `meats` remains unchanged, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `mx` remains undefined, `my` remains undefined, `count` remains undefined.**
