Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), `K` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\), `low` and `high` are such that `high - low > 1e-07`. If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns true, `high` is now equal to \((low + high) / 2\). Otherwise, `low` is now equal to \((low + high) / 2\).***
