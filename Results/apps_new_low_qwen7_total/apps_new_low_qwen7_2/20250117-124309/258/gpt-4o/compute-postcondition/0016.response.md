The variable `low` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is \((low + high) / 2\). All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), `K` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\), `low` is now \((low + high) / 2\), `high` and `mid` are such that `high - low > 1e-07`, `mid` is \((low + high) / 2**.
