Postcondition: ***i is 0, j is 1, meats remains unchanged, x1 is the original value of x2, y1 is the original value of y2, c1 is the original value of c2, x2 is the original value of x1, y2 is the original value of y1, c2 is the original value of c1, d is ((c1 × T - c2 × T) / (c1 × c2)), mx is cx + dy × math.sqrt(d2 × d - d × d) / d2, my is cy - dx × math.sqrt(d2 × d - d × d) / d2, count is the number of elements in meats where c * sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2) <= d. If count is greater than or equal to K, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns the original state of the variables and the count remains unchanged.***
