Postcondition: **`i` is N, `j` is undefined, `x1` is undefined, `y1` is undefined, `c1` is undefined, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`, `d` is \((-c1 \times T - c2 \times T) / (c1 \times c2)\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \((x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4\), `mx` is undefined, `my` is undefined, `count` is less than K, `T` is undefined, `meats` is undefined, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `x2` is reassigned to the original value of `x1`, and `y2` is reassigned to the original value of `y1`. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
