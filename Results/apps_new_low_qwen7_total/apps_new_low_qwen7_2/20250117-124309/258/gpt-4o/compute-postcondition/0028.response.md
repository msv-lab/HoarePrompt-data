Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `meats` remains unchanged, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`, `d` is \((c1 \times T - c2 \times T) / (c1 \times c2)\). If \(d \times d2 > d2\), then no changes occur. Since there is no else part, the values remain as they were before the if statement.***
