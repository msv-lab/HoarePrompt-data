Postcondition: ***i is N, j is N + 2, x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2, d, cx, cy, dx, dy, and d2 retain their original values from the precondition. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or the postcondition remains unchanged).***
