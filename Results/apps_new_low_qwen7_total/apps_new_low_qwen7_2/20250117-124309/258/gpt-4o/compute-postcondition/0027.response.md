The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not affect any variable values. All variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `meats` remains unchanged, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`, `d` is \((c1 \times T - c2 \times T) / (c1 \times c2)\)**
