The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is N, `j` is N + 2, `x1` is the value at index `i` of `meats`, `y1` is the value at index `i+1` of `meats`, `c1` is the value at index `i+2` of `meats`, `x2` is the value at index `j` of `meats`, `y2` is the value at index `j+1` of `meats`, `c2` is the value at index `j+2` of `meats`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T)`, `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(x1 - x2\). If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is the value at index `j` of `meats`, `y1` is the value at index `j+1` of `meats`, `c1` is the value at index `j+2` of `meats`, `x2` is the value at index `i` of `meats`, `y2` is the value at index `i+1` of `meats`, `c2` is the value at index `i+2` of `meats`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
