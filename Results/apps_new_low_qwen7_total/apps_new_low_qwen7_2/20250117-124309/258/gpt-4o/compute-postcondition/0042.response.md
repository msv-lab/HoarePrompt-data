Output State: **i is 0, j is 2, meats remains unchanged, x1 is the original value of x2, y1 is the original value of y2, c1 is the original value of c2, x2 is the original value of x1, y2 is the original value of y1, c2 is the original value of c1, d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c2 * c1), mx remains undefined, my remains undefined, count is the number of elements in meats where c * sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T**

Explanation:
- The value of `d` is calculated using the formula \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\).
- The values of `mx` and `my` are defined using the formulas:
  \[
  mx = cx + dy \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d}}{d2}
  \]
  \[
  my = cy - dx \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d}}{d2}
  \]
  However, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, and `dy` are not defined in the provided code snippet, so `mx` and `my` remain undefined.
- The value of `count` is computed as the sum of `c * sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T` for each element `(x, y, c)` in `meats`. This condition checks if the distance from each point to `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`. Since `mx` and `my` are undefined, this condition cannot be evaluated, and `count` remains undefined.
