The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `N` and `K`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 60, and `meats`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains three integers (x, y, c), representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness c of the i-th piece of meat. 

Based on the given constraints and the structure of the input, the function will process this information, but the specific details of the processing are not provided here.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`, where `N` and `K` are positive integers satisfying the condition 1 <= K <= N <= 60, and `meats` is a list of tuples containing the coordinates and hardness of meat pieces.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N, K (positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 60), and meats (a list of tuples, each containing three integers (x, y, c) representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness c of the i-th piece of meat).**
