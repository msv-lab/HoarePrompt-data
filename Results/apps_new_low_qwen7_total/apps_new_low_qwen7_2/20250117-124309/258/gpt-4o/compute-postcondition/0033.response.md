The given code snippet extracts the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` from the `meats` list at index `i`, and `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` from the `meats` list at index `j`. However, since no further operations or calculations involving these extracted values are performed, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` remain unchanged after this code block is executed.

Given the initial state:
- \( i \) is 0
- \( j \) is 2
- \( \text{meats} \) remains unchanged
- \( x1 \) is the original value of \( x2 \)
- \( y1 \) is the original value of \( y2 \)
- \( c1 \) is the original value of \( c2 \)
- \( x2 \) is the original value of \( x1 \)
- \( y2 \) is the original value of \( y1 \)
- \( c2 \) is the original value of \( c1 \)
- \( d \) is \(\frac{(c1 \times T - c2 \times T)}{(c1 \times c2)}\)
- \( \text{mx} \) is \( cx + dy \times \frac{\sqrt{d^2 \times d - d \times d}}{d^2} \)
- \( \text{my} \) is \( cy - dx \times \frac{\sqrt{d^2 \times d - d \times d}}{d^2} \)
- \( \text{count} \) is the number of elements in \( \text{meats} \) where \( c \times \sqrt{(\text{mx} - x)^2 + (\text{my} - y)^2} \leq d \)

After running the code snippet, the following values remain unchanged:
- \( i \) is 0
- \( j \) is 2
- \( \text{meats} \) remains unchanged
- \( x1 \) is the original value of \( x2 \)
- \( y1 \) is the original value of \( y2 \)
- \( c1 \) is the original value of \( c2 \)
- \( x2 \) is the original value of \( x1 \)
- \( y2 \) is the original value of \( y1 \)
- \( c2 \) is the original value of \( c1 \)

The values of \( d \), \( \text{mx} \), \( \text{my} \), and \( \text{count} \) are not computed and therefore remain undefined in this context.

Output State: **i is 0, j is 2, meats remains unchanged, x1 is the original value of x2, y1 is the original value of y2, c1 is the original value of c2, x2 is the original value of x1, y2 is the original value of y1, c2 is the original value of c1, d is undefined, mx is undefined, my is undefined, count is undefined**
