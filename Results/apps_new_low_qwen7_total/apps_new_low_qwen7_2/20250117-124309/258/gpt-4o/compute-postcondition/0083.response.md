Postcondition: ***`x1` is `x2` if `c1 * T` < `c2 * T` and `x1` otherwise, `y1` is `y2` if `c1 * T` < `c2 * T` and `y1` otherwise, `c1` is `c2` if `c1 * T` < `c2 * T` and `c1` otherwise; `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`. If `d < 0`, then `d` remains as `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Otherwise, no change is made to `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, and `d` retains its original value.***
