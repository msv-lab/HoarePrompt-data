Postcondition: ***`i` is N, `j` is undefined, `x1` is undefined, `y1` is undefined, `c1` is undefined, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `dx² + dy²`, `mx` is undefined, `my` is undefined, `count` is less than `K`, `T` is undefined, `meats` is undefined. If `d * d2 > d2`, then `d2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition `d * d2 > d2` does not hold.***
