Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), `K` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\), `low` and `high` are updated according to the result of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`. If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns true, `high` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`. `mid` is always updated to \((low + high) / 2\).***
