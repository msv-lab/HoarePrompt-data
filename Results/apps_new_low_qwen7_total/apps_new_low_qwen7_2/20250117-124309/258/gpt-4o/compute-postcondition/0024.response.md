The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. The values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `meats` remains unchanged, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`; `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`.**
