Postcondition: ***`i` is N, `j` is N + 2, `x1` is the value at index i of `meats`, `y1` is the value at index i+1 of `meats`, `c1` is the value at index i+2 of `meats`, `x2` is the value at index j of `meats`, `y2` is the value at index j+1 of `meats`, `c2` is the value at index j+2 of `meats`, `d` is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), `cx` is (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is ((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2. If `d * d2 > d2`, the condition holds. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.***
