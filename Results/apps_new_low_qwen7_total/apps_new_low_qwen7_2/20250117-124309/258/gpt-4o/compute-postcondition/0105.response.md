Output State: **i is N, j is N + 1, x1 is the x-coordinate of the meat at index N + 1, y1 is the y-coordinate of the meat at index N + 1, c1 is the x-coordinate of the meat at index N if c1 * T >= c2 * T else x2, c2 is the y-coordinate of the meat at index N + 1 if c1 * T >= c2 * T else y1, d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is dx * dx + dy * dx, mx is cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, my is cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, count is the number of meats within the distance T from the point (mx, my)**

Explanation:
- The code calculates the new coordinates `mx` and `my` based on the previous values of `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d`.
- `mx` is calculated using the formula `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
- `my` is calculated using the formula `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
- `count` is calculated as the sum of a boolean expression for each meat in the list `meats`. The boolean expression checks if the Euclidean distance between each meat's position `(x, y)` and the point `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`.

Since the initial values of `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` remain unchanged, and `count` is a new variable introduced by the code, the final state includes all these variables with their respective updated values.
