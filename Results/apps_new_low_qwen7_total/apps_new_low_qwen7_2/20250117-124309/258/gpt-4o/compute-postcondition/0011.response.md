The code assigns the value of `mid` to `low`. Therefore, the new value of `low` is \((low + high) / 2\). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), `K` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\), `low` is \((low + high) / 2\), `high` is either 1000000000.0 or 500000000.0, `mid` is \((low + high) / 2\)**
