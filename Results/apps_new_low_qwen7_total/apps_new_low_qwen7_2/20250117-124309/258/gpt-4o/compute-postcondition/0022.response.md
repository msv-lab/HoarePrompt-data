Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `meats` remains unchanged, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are such that `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`. Since there is no else part, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain as per the if condition.**
