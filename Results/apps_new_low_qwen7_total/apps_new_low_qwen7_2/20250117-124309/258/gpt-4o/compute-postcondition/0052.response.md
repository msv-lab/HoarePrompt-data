`d` is assigned the value of `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Given the precondition that `c1 * T < c2 * T` is true, the expression `c1 * T - c2 * T` results in a negative value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is N, `j` is undefined, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is undefined, `y2` is undefined, `c2` is undefined, and `d` is a negative value equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`.**
