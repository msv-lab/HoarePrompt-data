Postcondition: **i is N, j is N + 1, x1 is the x-coordinate of the meat at index N + 1, y1 is the y-coordinate of the meat at index N + 1, c1 is the x-coordinate of the meat at index N if c1 * T >= c2 * T else x2, c2 is the y-coordinate of the meat at index N + 1 if c1 * T >= c2 * T else y1, d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is dx * dx + dy * dx, mx is cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, my is cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, count is the number of meats within the distance T from the point (mx, my). The condition count is greater than or equal to K holds true.**
