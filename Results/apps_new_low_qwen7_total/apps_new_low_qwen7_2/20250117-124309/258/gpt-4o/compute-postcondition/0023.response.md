`d` is assigned the value of `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Given the initial conditions, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain as per the if condition since the expression `d = c1 * T - c2 * T` does not affect these variables. The output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `meats` remains unchanged, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`; `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`.**
