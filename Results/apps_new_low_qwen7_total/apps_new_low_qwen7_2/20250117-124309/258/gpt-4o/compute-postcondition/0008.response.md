Based on the provided code snippet and initial state, let's analyze the impact of each line:

Initial State:
- \( N \) must be greater than 0
- \( \text{index} = 3 \times N \)
- \( \text{meats} \) is a list containing \( N \) tuples \( (x, y, c) \), where \( x \), \( y \), and \( c \) are integers derived from data at indices \( \text{index}-3(i-1) \), \( \text{index}-3(i-1)+1 \), and \( \text{index}-3(i-1)+2 \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( N \)

Code Block:
```python
result = func_2(N, K, meats)
print(f'{result:.6f}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`result = func_2(N, K, meats)`**: This line calls the function `func_2` with arguments `N`, `K`, and `meats`. The function `func_2` takes these parameters and returns a value, which is stored in `result`.

2. **`print(f'{result:.6f}')`**: This line prints the value of `result` formatted to 6 decimal places. 

Since the actual definition of `func_2` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `result`. However, based on the call to `func_2`, we know that `result` will be a numeric value computed by the function.

### Final Output State:
- The value of `N` remains unchanged.
- The value of `index` remains unchanged.
- The list `meats` remains unchanged.
- The value of `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`, formatted to 6 decimal places.

Given this, the final output state is:

Output State: **N is a positive integer, index is 3 * N, meats is a list of N tuples (x, y, c), result is a floating-point number returned by func_2(N, K, meats) formatted to 6 decimal places**
