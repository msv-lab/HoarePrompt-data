Postcondition: **`i` is N, `j` is N + 1, `x1` is the x-coordinate of the meat at index N+1, `y1` is the y-coordinate of the meat at index N+1, `c1` is the y-coordinate of the meat at index N+1, `x2` is the x-coordinate of the meat at index N, `y2` is the y-coordinate of the meat at index N, `c2` is the x-coordinate of the meat at index N. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `c1` is updated to the x-coordinate of the meat at index N, and `c2` is updated to the y-coordinate of the meat at index N+1. If `c1 * T` is not less than `c2 * T`, the values of `c1` and `c2` remain unchanged. All other variables remain unchanged.**
