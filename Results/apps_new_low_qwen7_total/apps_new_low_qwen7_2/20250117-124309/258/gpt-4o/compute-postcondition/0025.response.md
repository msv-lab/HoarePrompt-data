Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `meats` remains unchanged, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`; `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`. If `d` is less than 0, then no changes occur.***
