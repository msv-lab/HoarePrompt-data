The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables outside of the loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **i is 0, j is 2, meats remains unchanged, x1 is the original value of x2, y1 is the original value of y2, c1 is the original value of c2, x2 is the original value of x1, y2 is the original value of y1, c2 is the original value of c1, d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), mx remains undefined, my remains undefined, count remains undefined**
