Postcondition: ***`i` is N, `j` is undefined, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is undefined, `y2` is undefined, `c2` is undefined, and the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is true.***

This postcondition summarizes that since there is no else part, the overall state of the program remains as per the if part's conditions, with the additional information that the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` must hold true.
