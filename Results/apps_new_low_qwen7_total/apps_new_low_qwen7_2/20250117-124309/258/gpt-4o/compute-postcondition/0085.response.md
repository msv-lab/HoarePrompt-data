The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, in this context, since there is no loop present in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables. The states of all the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x1` is `a`, `y1` is `b`, `c1` is `c`, `d` is `0`, `cx` is `a`, `cy` is `b`, `dx` is `0`, `dy` is `0`.**
