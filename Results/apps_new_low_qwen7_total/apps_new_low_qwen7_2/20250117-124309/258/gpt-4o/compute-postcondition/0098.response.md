Postcondition: ***`i` is `N`, `j` is `N + 1`, `x1` is the x-coordinate of the meat at index `N + 1`, `y1` is the y-coordinate of the meat at index `N + 1`, `c1` is the x-coordinate of the meat at index `N` if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` else `x2`, `c2` is the y-coordinate of the meat at index `N + 1` if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` else `y1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`. The current value of `d` is less than 0***
