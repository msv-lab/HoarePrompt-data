The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. 

- `N` and `K` are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 60.
- `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of the i-th piece of meat, respectively.

After executing the function body, the function returns a value `high` such that `high - low <= 1e-07`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept positive integers `N` and `K` with the specified constraints, and a list `meats` of tuples containing coordinates and hardness of meat pieces, and return a value `high` where the difference between `high` and another value `low` is at most 1e-07.
