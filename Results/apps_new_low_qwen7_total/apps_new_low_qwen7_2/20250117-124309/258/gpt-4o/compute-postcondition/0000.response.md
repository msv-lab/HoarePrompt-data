The provided code snippet reads inputs and initializes variables but does not complete the full logic to process the meats list. However, based on the given information and the initial state, we can determine the final state after executing the provided lines.

Initial State: 
- `N` and `K` are positive integers such that `1 <= K <= N <= 60`.
- `meats` is an empty list of tuples.

Code Snippet:
```python
data = input().split()
N = int(data[0])
K = int(data[1])
meats = []
index = 2
```

After executing the code snippet:
1. `data` is set to the split input.
2. `N` is set to the first element of `data` converted to an integer.
3. `K` is set to the second element of `data` converted to an integer.
4. `meats` is initialized as an empty list.
5. `index` is set to 2.

Since no further operations are performed on these variables within the provided code snippet, their values remain unchanged after the execution of the given lines.

Output State: **N is a positive integer, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, meats is an empty list, index is 2**
