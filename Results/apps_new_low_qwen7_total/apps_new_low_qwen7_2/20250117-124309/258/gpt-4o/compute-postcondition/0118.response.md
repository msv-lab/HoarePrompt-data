Postcondition: ***`i` is N, `j` is N + 2, `x1` is x2, `y1` is y2, `c1` is c2, `x2` is x1, `y2` is y1, `c2` is c1, `d` is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), `cx` is (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is (x1 - x2). If `d * d2 > d2`, the conditions remain unchanged.***
