Output State: **i is 0, j is 1, meats remains unchanged, x1 is the original value of x2, y1 is the original value of y2, c1 is the original value of c2, x2 is the original value of x1, y2 is the original value of y1, c2 is the original value of c1, d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)**

Explanation:
- The first line `d /= c1 * c2` divides the current value of `d` by `c1 * c2`. Since `d` is defined as `c1 * T - c2 * T`, it gets updated to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
- The following lines (`cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`) do not modify any variables and are used for calculations but do not change the state of any variables.
- Therefore, the values of `i`, `j`, `meats`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, and `d` remain as described in the initial state, with the exception that `d` is updated as per the division operation.
