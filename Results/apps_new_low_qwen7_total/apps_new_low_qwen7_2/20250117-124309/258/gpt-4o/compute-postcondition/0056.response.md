Output State: **i is N, j is undefined, x1 is the original value of x2, y1 is the original value of y2, c1 is the original value of c2, x2 is undefined, y2 is undefined, c2 is undefined, d is (-c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is (x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4**

Explanation:
1. The line `d /= c1 * c2` divides the value of `d` by `c1 * c2`. Given that `d` is initially `-c1 * T - c2 * T`, it becomes `(-c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
2. The line `cx = (x1 + x2) / 2` calculates the average of `x1` and `x2` and assigns it to `cx`. Since `x2` is undefined, `cx` remains undefined.
3. The line `cy = (y1 + y2) / 2` calculates the average of `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `cy`. Since `y2` is undefined, `cy` remains undefined.
4. The line `dx = (x1 - x2) / 2` calculates half the difference between `x1` and `x2` and assigns it to `dx`. Since `x2` is undefined, `dx` remains undefined.
5. The line `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2` calculates half the difference between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `dy`. Since `y2` is undefined, `dy` remains undefined.
6. The line `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy` calculates the sum of squares of `dx` and `dy` and assigns it to `d2`. Since both `dx` and `dy` are undefined, `d2` remains undefined. However, based on the formula given, if `x2` and `y2` were defined, `d2` would be `(x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4`.

Since no new variables are introduced and no values are overwritten, the rest of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.
