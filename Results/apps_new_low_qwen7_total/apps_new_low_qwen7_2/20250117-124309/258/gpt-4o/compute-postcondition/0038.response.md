Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `meats` remains unchanged, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `mx` remains undefined, `my` remains undefined, `count` remains undefined. Since the if condition `d < 0` does not change any variables and there is no else part, the overall postcondition is the same as the precondition.***
