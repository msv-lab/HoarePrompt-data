Postcondition: **`i` is N, `j` is N + 1, `x1` is the x-coordinate of the meat at index N + 1, `y1` is the y-coordinate of the meat at index N + 1, `c1` is the x-coordinate of the meat at index N if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` else `x2`, `c2` is the y-coordinate of the meat at index N + 1 if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` else `y1`, `d` is (`c1 * T - c2 * T`) / (`c1 * c2`), `cx` is (`x1 + x2`) / 2, `cy` is (`y1 + y2`) / 2, `dx` is (`x1 - x2`) / 2, `dy` is (`y1 - y2`) / 2, `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dx`, and the condition `d * d2 > d2` is true**
