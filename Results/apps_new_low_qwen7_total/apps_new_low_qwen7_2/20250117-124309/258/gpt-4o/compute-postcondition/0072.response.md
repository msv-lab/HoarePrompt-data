The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is N, `j` is undefined, `x1` is undefined, `y1` is undefined, `c1` is undefined, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `dx² + dy²`, `mx` is undefined, `my` is undefined, `count` is less than `K`, `T` is undefined, `meats` is undefined**
