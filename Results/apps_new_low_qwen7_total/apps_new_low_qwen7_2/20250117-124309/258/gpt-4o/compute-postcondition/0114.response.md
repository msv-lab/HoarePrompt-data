The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. The values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `N`, `j` is `N + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `x1`, `y2` is `y1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`**
