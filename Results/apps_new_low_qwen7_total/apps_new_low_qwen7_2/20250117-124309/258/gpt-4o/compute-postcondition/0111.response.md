The code swaps the values of `(x1, y1, c1)` with `(x2, y2, c2)`. Given the initial state:
- `i` is still `N`
- `j` is `N + 2`
- `x1, y1, c1` are the values of `meats[N]`
- `x2, y2, c2` are the values of `meats[N + 2]`

After executing the code, the values of `x1, y1, c1` will now be `x2, y2, c2`, respectively, and the values of `x2, y2, c2` will now be `x1, y1, c1`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is still N, `j` is N + 2, `x1` is x2, `y1` is y2, `c1` is c2, `x2` is x1, `y2` is y1, `c2` is c1**
