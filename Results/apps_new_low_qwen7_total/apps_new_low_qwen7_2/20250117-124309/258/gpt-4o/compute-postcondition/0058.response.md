The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables outside of the loop context. Since no loop context is provided in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:

- `i` is N
- `j` is undefined
- `x1` is the original value of `x2`
- `y1` is the original value of `y2`
- `c1` is the original value of `c2`
- `x2` is undefined
- `y2` is undefined
- `c2` is undefined
- `d` is \((-c1 \times T - c2 \times T) / (c1 \times c2)\)
- `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\)
- `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\)
- `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
- `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\)
- `d2` is \((x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4\)
- The condition `(d * d2 > d2)` is true

The `continue` statement does not change these values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is N, `j` is undefined, `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, `c1` is the original value of `c2`, `x2` is undefined, `y2` is undefined, `c2` is undefined, `d` is \((-c1 \times T - c2 \times T) / (c1 \times c2)\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \((x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4\), and the condition `(d * d2 > d2)` is true.**
