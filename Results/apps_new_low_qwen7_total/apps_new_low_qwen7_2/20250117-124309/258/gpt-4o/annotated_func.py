    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of meat pieces represented as tuples containing coordinates and hardness, an integer `K`, and an integer `T`. It iterates through all pairs of meat pieces and checks if the hardness difference scaled by `T` can be used to transform one meat piece into another in a way that satisfies the condition `count >= K`, where `count` is the number of meat pieces whose distance from a calculated point `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`. If such a transformation is found, the function returns `True`. If no such transformation exists after checking all pairs, the function returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `meats` is empty or `K` is zero, in which case the function should return `False`. The function does not modify the `meats` list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 60, and meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of the i-th piece of meat, respectively.

        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), `K` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\), `low` and `high` are such that `high - low <= 1e-07`. `mid` is the average value of `low` and `high` just before exiting the loop.
    return high
    #The program returns `high`, which is a value such that `high - low <= 1e-07`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. `N` and `K` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), and `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\) representing the coordinates and hardness of the \(i\)-th piece of meat. The function uses binary search to find a value `high` such that `high - low <= 1e-07`, where `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and 1000000000.0, respectively. Inside the loop, it calls another function `func_1` with `meats`, `K`, and `mid` to determine whether a solution exists for the current midpoint value. Based on the result, it adjusts `low` and `high` accordingly. After the loop, the function returns the value of `high`, ensuring that the difference between `high` and `low` is within the specified tolerance. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input list `meats` might be empty or contain invalid data, although the provided code does not explicitly handle these cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 60. meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x, y, c) representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness c of the i-th piece of meat.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N must be greater than 0, index is 3 * N, meats is a list containing N tuples (x, y, c) where x, y, and c are integers derived from data at indices index-3*(i-1), index-3*(i-1)+1, and index-3*(i-1)+2 for i from 1 to N.

print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of integers from standard input, which represent the number of pieces of meat (N), a positive integer K, and the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of each piece of meat. It then calls `func_2` with these parameters. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. The function ensures that N and K are positive integers with 1 <= K <= N <= 60, and that the input data is correctly parsed into the `meats` list. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats or values that do not meet the specified constraints. If the input does not conform to the expected format or constraints, the function will not produce meaningful output.
