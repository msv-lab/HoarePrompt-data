The function `func_1` accepts a list of meat pieces represented as tuples containing coordinates and hardness, an integer `K`, and an integer `T`. It iterates through all pairs of meat pieces and checks if the hardness difference scaled by `T` can be used to transform one meat piece into another in a way that satisfies the condition `count >= K`, where `count` is the number of meat pieces whose distance from a calculated point `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`. If such a transformation is found, the function returns `True`. If no such transformation exists after checking all pairs, the function returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `meats` is empty or `K` is zero, in which case the function should return `False`. The function does not modify the `meats` list.
