The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. `N` and `K` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), and `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\) representing the coordinates and hardness of the \(i\)-th piece of meat. The function uses binary search to find a value `high` such that `high - low <= 1e-07`, where `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and 1000000000.0, respectively. Inside the loop, it calls another function `func_1` with `meats`, `K`, and `mid` to determine whether a solution exists for the current midpoint value. Based on the result, it adjusts `low` and `high` accordingly. After the loop, the function returns the value of `high`, ensuring that the difference between `high` and `low` is within the specified tolerance. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input list `meats` might be empty or contain invalid data, although the provided code does not explicitly handle these cases.
