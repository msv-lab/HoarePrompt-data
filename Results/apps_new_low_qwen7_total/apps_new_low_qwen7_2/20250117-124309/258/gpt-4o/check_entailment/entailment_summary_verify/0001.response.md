### Reasoning:

#### Analysis of `func_1`:

- **Purpose**: `func_1` is intended to check if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be grilled. However, the current implementation has several issues:
  - The function does not correctly handle the calculation of the optimal point for the heat source.
  - The logic inside the function does not seem to properly calculate the time required for each piece of meat to be grilled based on the distance and hardness.
  - The function uses a flawed approach to swap and sort the coordinates, which is unnecessary and does not contribute to finding the optimal point.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:

- **Binary Search Approach**: The function `func_2` uses a binary search approach to find the minimum time required to grill `K` pieces of meat. This approach is generally correct and efficient for this type of problem.
- **Use of `func_1`**: `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` to check if a given time `T` allows `K` pieces of meat to be grilled. This ensures that the binary search converges to the correct answer.

#### Analysis of `func_3`:

- **Input Handling**: `func_3` correctly reads the input and processes it. It then calls `func_2` to get the result and prints it formatted to six decimal places.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles potential edge cases such as invalid input formats or values that do not meet the specified constraints.

#### Summary:

- **Function `func_1`**: The current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the optimal point for the heat source. The logic inside `func_1` is flawed and does not address the problem correctly.
- **Function `func_2`**: The binary search approach is correct and efficient.
- **Function `func_3`**: The input handling is correct and follows the requirements.

Given that the main issue lies in the implementation of `func_1`, and assuming that the problem requires the correct calculation of the optimal point, the current solution is incomplete and incorrect.

However, the original assessment provided an analysis that focused on the structure and general approach of the solution rather than the detailed implementation of `func_1`. The overall structure of the solution appears sound, but the specific implementation of `func_1` is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_1`. While the overall structure and approach (binary search and input handling) are correct, the specific implementation of `func_1` does not correctly calculate the optimal point for the heat source, leading to an incorrect solution.
