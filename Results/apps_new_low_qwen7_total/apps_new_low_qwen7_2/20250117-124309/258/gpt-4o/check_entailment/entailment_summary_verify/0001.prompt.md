You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function reads a series of integers from standard input, which represent the number of pieces of meat (N), a positive integer K, and the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of each piece of meat. It then calls `func_2` with these parameters. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. The function ensures that N and K are positive integers with 1 <= K <= N <= 60, and that the input data is correctly parsed into the `meats` list. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats or values that do not meet the specified constraints. If the input does not conform to the expected format or constraints, the function will not produce meaningful output.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided solution consists of three functions:
1. `func_1` checks if a given time `T` allows a certain number `K` of pieces of meat to be grilled.
2. `func_2` uses binary search to find the minimum time required to grill `K` pieces of meat.
3. `func_3` reads input and calls the appropriate functions to solve the problem.

Let's analyze each function:

### Function 1: `func_1`
This function is intended to check if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be grilled. However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The function does not correctly handle the calculation of the optimal point for the heat source.
- It iterates over pairs of meats but does not compute the optimal point directly.

### Function 2: `func_2`
This function uses binary search to find the minimum time required to grill `K` pieces of meat. It calls `func_1` to check if a given time `T` allows `K` pieces of meat to be grilled. The binary search is implemented correctly, and it should converge to the correct answer.

### Function 3: `func_3`
This function reads the input and processes it correctly. It then calls `func_2` to get the result and prints it formatted to six decimal places.

Given that `func_2` uses a correct binary search approach and relies on `func_1` to make the necessary checks, the overall solution seems to be on the right track. However, `func_1` needs to be corrected to ensure it calculates the optimal point correctly.

Since the problem description and constraints are met, and the provided solution structure seems correct, the issue lies in the implementation of `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**

To fix `func_1`, you would need to implement the logic to find the optimal point `(X, Y)` such that the time taken to grill `K` pieces of meat is minimized. This involves finding the center of mass of the points weighted by their cooking times `c_i`.
