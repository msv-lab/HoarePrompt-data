Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if there exists a location \((X, Y)\) such that at least \(K\) pieces of meat are ready within time \(T\). It does this by iterating over all pairs of meat pieces and calculating a potential location \((mx, my)\) based on the hardness difference.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, it is designed to check for the existence of a single pair of points that can satisfy the condition, rather than finding the optimal location for a single heat source that minimizes the required time for \(K\) pieces of meat to be ready.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the minimum time \(T\) such that at least \(K\) pieces of meat are ready when the heat source is optimally placed. 
   - However, the binary search in `func_2` is incorrectly applied. The function `func_1` is called within the binary search loop to check if a given time `T` meets the requirement, but it does not correctly compute the optimal location for the heat source. 

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads input data and constructs the list of meat pieces. It then calls `func_2` to get the required time and prints the result.
   - The reading of input and construction of the `meats` list appear correct, assuming the input format is correct.

Given the issues in `func_1` and `func_2`, the overall program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the optimal location for a single heat source to minimize the time required for at least \(K\) pieces of meat to be ready.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
