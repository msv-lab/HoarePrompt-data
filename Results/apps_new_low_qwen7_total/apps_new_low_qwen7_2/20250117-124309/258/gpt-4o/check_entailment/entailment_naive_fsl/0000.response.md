Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a binary search approach combined with a custom function `func_1` to check if a certain time `T` can satisfy the condition of having `K` or more pieces of meat ready. However, the implementation of `func_1` has a logical flaw.

In `func_1`, the code checks pairs of meats and tries to find a midpoint between them to potentially reduce the time required for cooking. The calculation of `mx` and `my` assumes that the optimal point lies on the line segment between the two points being checked, but this is not necessarily true. The optimal point could be anywhere in the plane that minimizes the total cooking time for `K` or more pieces of meat.

The program does not account for the possibility that the optimal heat source might not lie on the line segment between any two points. It only considers pairs of points and does not explore other potential points that could minimize the total cooking time.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 3
0 0 1
1 0 1
0 1 1
2 2 1
```

The correct solution would place the heat source at the origin (0,0) to minimize the cooking time for three or more pieces of meat, which would take 2 seconds. However, the current implementation would fail to find this optimal point and would likely return a higher time due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready, and hence it is incorrect.
