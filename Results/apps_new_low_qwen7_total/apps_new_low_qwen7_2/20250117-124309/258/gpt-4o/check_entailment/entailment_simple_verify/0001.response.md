### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Function 1: `func_1`
- The purpose of `func_1` is to determine if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be grilled. 
- The function iterates over all pairs of meats, sorts them by hardness (or rather, by the product of hardness and time `T`), and then calculates the midpoint between these pairs.
- The key issue is that the midpoint calculation and the distance calculations are not correctly aligned to find the optimal point. Instead, it tries to find a midpoint that satisfies the condition without correctly minimizing the total grilling time.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
- This function performs a binary search to find the minimum time `T` required to grill `K` pieces of meat.
- It calls `func_1` to check if a given time `T` is sufficient to grill `K` pieces of meat.
- The binary search logic is correct and converges to the correct answer.

#### Function 3: `func_3`
- Reads input and processes it correctly.
- Calls `func_2` to get the result and prints it formatted to six decimal places.

### Analysis Based on Annotations:
- The annotations show that `func_1` does not correctly compute the optimal point for the heat source. The logic for calculating the midpoint and distances is flawed.
- `func_2` correctly uses binary search and relies on `func_1` to check conditions, but `func_1` is incorrect.

Given the flaws in `func_1`, the overall solution will not work as intended. The program will not correctly find the optimal point and hence may return incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The main issue lies in the implementation of `func_1`, which does not correctly calculate the optimal point for the heat source. Therefore, the program as given will not always produce the correct result.

Final: **False**
