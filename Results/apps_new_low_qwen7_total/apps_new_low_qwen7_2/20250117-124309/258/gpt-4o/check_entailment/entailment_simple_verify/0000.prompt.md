You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a binary search approach combined with a custom function `func_1` to check if a certain time `T` can satisfy the condition of having `K` or more pieces of meat ready. However, the implementation of `func_1` has a logical flaw.

In `func_1`, the code checks pairs of meats and tries to find a midpoint between them to potentially reduce the time required for cooking. The calculation of `mx` and `my` assumes that the optimal point lies on the line segment between the two points being checked, but this is not necessarily true. The optimal point could be anywhere in the plane that minimizes the total cooking time for `K` or more pieces of meat.

The program does not account for the possibility that the optimal heat source might not lie on the line segment between any two points. It only considers pairs of points and does not explore other potential points that could minimize the total cooking time.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 3
0 0 1
1 0 1
0 1 1
2 2 1
```

The correct solution would place the heat source at the origin (0,0) to minimize the cooking time for three or more pieces of meat, which would take 2 seconds. However, the current implementation would fail to find this optimal point and would likely return a higher time due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready, and hence it is incorrect.
