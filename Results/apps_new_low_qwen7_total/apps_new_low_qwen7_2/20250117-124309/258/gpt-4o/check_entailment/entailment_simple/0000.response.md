### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Data Structure:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and parses it into a list of tuples `meats` where each tuple contains the coordinates \((x_i, y_i)\) and hardness \(c_i\) of the \(i\)-th piece of meat.
   - The state after parsing matches the expected structure.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The `func_2` function uses binary search to find the minimum time \(T\) required to have \(K\) or more pieces of meat ready.
   - The initial bounds for the binary search are set appropriately: `low` starts at 0 and `high` at 1,000,000,000 (a large upper bound).
   - The function iteratively refines the search range until `high - low <= 1e-07`.
   - Inside the loop, `func_1` is called with the current midpoint `mid` to check if it's possible to have \(K\) or more pieces ready within time `mid`.

3. **Feasibility Check Function:**
   - The `func_1` function checks if there exists a point \((X, Y)\) such that \(K\) or more pieces of meat become ready within time \(T\).
   - It uses a geometric approach to find potential points and check their feasibility.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the distance between two points is relevant for determining the feasibility of having the required number of pieces ready.

4. **Return Value:**
   - `func_2` returns the highest feasible time `high` after the binary search converges, ensuring the absolute or relative error is at most \(10^{-6}\).

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic of using binary search combined with a feasibility check is sound for solving the problem.
   - The implementation adheres to the constraints and the problem statement.
