### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's re-examine the logic in the provided program to confirm why the assessment is correct.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is designed to check pairs of meat pieces and determine if there exists a point between them that can help reduce the cooking time for at least `K` pieces of meat.
- The primary issue is that `func_1` only considers the midpoint between pairs of meat pieces, which may not be the optimal point to minimize the total cooking time.
- The logic for calculating `mx` and `my` assumes that the optimal point lies on the line segment between the two points being checked. However, the optimal point could be elsewhere in the plane.

#### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the input:
```
4 3
0 0 1
1 0 1
0 1 1
2 2 1
```
- The correct solution would place the heat source at the origin (0,0) to minimize the cooking time for three or more pieces of meat, which would take 2 seconds.
- However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not explore this possibility and instead focuses on midpoints between pairs of points, which can lead to suboptimal solutions.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the minimum time `T` such that `K` or more pieces of meat are ready.
- While the binary search approach is sound in theory, it relies on the correctness of `func_1` to determine the feasibility of a given `T`.
- Since `func_1` is flawed, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

#### Overall Evaluation:
- The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready.
- The original assessment accurately points out that the program fails to account for the possibility that the optimal heat source might not lie on the line segment between any two points.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the original assessment is correct. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
