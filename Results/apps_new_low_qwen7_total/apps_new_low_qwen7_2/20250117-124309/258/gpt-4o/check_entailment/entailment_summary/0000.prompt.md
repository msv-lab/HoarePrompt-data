 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list of meat pieces represented as tuples containing coordinates and hardness, an integer `K`, and an integer `T`. It iterates through all pairs of meat pieces and checks if the hardness difference scaled by `T` can be used to transform one meat piece into another in a way that satisfies the condition `count >= K`, where `count` is the number of meat pieces whose distance from a calculated point `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`. If such a transformation is found, the function returns `True`. If no such transformation exists after checking all pairs, the function returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `meats` is empty or `K` is zero, in which case the function should return `False`. The function does not modify the `meats` list.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    (low, high) = (0, 1000000000.0)
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    return high
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. `N` and `K` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), and `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\) representing the coordinates and hardness of the \(i\)-th piece of meat. The function uses binary search to find a value `high` such that `high - low <= 1e-07`, where `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and 1000000000.0, respectively. Inside the loop, it calls another function `func_1` with `meats`, `K`, and `mid` to determine whether a solution exists for the current midpoint value. Based on the result, it adjusts `low` and `high` accordingly. After the loop, the function returns the value of `high`, ensuring that the difference between `high` and `low` is within the specified tolerance. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input list `meats` might be empty or contain invalid data, although the provided code does not explicitly handle these cases.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        index += 3
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads a series of integers from standard input, which represent the number of pieces of meat (N), a positive integer K, and the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of each piece of meat. It then calls `func_2` with these parameters. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. The function ensures that N and K are positive integers with 1 <= K <= N <= 60, and that the input data is correctly parsed into the `meats` list. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats or values that do not meet the specified constraints. If the input does not conform to the expected format or constraints, the function will not produce meaningful output.
