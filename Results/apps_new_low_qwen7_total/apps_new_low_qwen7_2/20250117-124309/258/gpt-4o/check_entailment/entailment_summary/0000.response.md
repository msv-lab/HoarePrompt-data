### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given functions to ensure they collectively solve the problem correctly:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is designed to check if a given `T` (time) is sufficient to make `K` or more pieces of meat ready to eat by placing the heat source at some optimal position.
   - It iterates over all pairs of meat pieces and calculates a potential optimal position for the heat source.
   - The function checks if placing the heat source at the calculated position can make at least `K` pieces of meat ready within time `T`.
   - If such a position is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the minimum `T` such that `func_1` returns `True`.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to a very large number (10^9).
   - In each iteration of the binary search, it checks if `func_1` returns `True` for the midpoint `mid` of the current interval `[low, high]`.
   - Depending on the result, it updates `low` or `high` to narrow down the search interval.
   - The loop continues until `high - low` is within the specified tolerance (`1e-07`).

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function reads the input, parses the data, and calls `func_2` with the appropriate parameters.
   - It ensures that the input is correctly formatted and parsed into a list of meat pieces.
   - Finally, it prints the result of `func_2` formatted to six decimal places.

### Verification:

1. **Constraints Handling:**
   - The functions handle the constraints appropriately, ensuring that `N` and `K` are within the specified ranges, and the coordinates and hardness are valid.

2. **Binary Search Correctness:**
   - The binary search in `func_2` is correctly implemented to find the minimum `T` such that `func_1` returns `True`.

3. **Pairwise Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - The pairwise calculation in `func_1` is designed to find the optimal position for the heat source, which is necessary to satisfy the condition of making `K` or more pieces of meat ready.

Given that:
- `func_1` correctly checks if a given `T` is sufficient to make `K` or more pieces of meat ready.
- `func_2` correctly uses binary search to find the minimum `T` using `func_1`.
- `func_3` correctly reads the input and calls the other functions.

All functions work together to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
