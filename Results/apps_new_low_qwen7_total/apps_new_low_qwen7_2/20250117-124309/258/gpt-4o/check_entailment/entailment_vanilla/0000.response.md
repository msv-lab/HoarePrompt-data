Reasoning:

The provided solution consists of three functions:
1. `func_1` checks if a given time `T` allows a certain number `K` of pieces of meat to be grilled.
2. `func_2` uses binary search to find the minimum time required to grill `K` pieces of meat.
3. `func_3` reads input and calls the appropriate functions to solve the problem.

Let's analyze each function:

### Function 1: `func_1`
This function is intended to check if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be grilled. However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The function does not correctly handle the calculation of the optimal point for the heat source.
- It iterates over pairs of meats but does not compute the optimal point directly.

### Function 2: `func_2`
This function uses binary search to find the minimum time required to grill `K` pieces of meat. It calls `func_1` to check if a given time `T` allows `K` pieces of meat to be grilled. The binary search is implemented correctly, and it should converge to the correct answer.

### Function 3: `func_3`
This function reads the input and processes it correctly. It then calls `func_2` to get the result and prints it formatted to six decimal places.

Given that `func_2` uses a correct binary search approach and relies on `func_1` to make the necessary checks, the overall solution seems to be on the right track. However, `func_1` needs to be corrected to ensure it calculates the optimal point correctly.

Since the problem description and constraints are met, and the provided solution structure seems correct, the issue lies in the implementation of `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**

To fix `func_1`, you would need to implement the logic to find the optimal point `(X, Y)` such that the time taken to grill `K` pieces of meat is minimized. This involves finding the center of mass of the points weighted by their cooking times `c_i`.
