Reasoning:

1. The program reads input and splits it into variables \( y_1 \), \( y_2 \), \( y_w \), \( x_b \), \( y_b \), and \( r \).
2. It calls the function `func_1` with these variables.
3. In `func_1`, the program checks various conditions to ensure the ball can be kicked in a way that it bounces off the wall and scores a goal.
4. The function first checks if the ball is too close to the target wall or if the target wall is too close to the goal, which would make it impossible to score. If so, it returns -1.
5. It then calculates the midpoint of the goal's height, ensuring the ball bounces within the goal's bounds.
6. Using the reflection principle, it calculates the required x-coordinate \( x_w \) where the ball should be kicked to bounce off the wall and land in the goal.
7. The final check ensures that the calculated \( x_w \) is valid and to the right of Robo-Wallace, i.e., greater than 0.

Given the logical steps and the correct application of geometric principles, the program should correctly identify whether a valid point \( x_w \) exists or return -1 if not. The provided state transitions and calculations align with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
