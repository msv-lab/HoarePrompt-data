Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the ball bounces off the right wall and still scores a goal. Specifically, the program calculates the x-coordinate of the point where the ball should bounce off the wall, but it does not check if this point results in the ball scoring a goal. According to the problem description, the ball must bounce exactly once and go straight to the goal.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this issue:

**Example Input:**
```
4 10 13 10 3 1
```
- `y1 = 4`, `y2 = 10`, `yw = 13`, `xb = 10`, `yb = 3`, `r = 1`
- The ball is positioned such that it needs to bounce off the right wall to score a goal.

According to the problem, the ball should bounce off the wall at a point that results in it scoring a goal. However, the current implementation only calculates the x-coordinate of the point where the ball bounces off the wall without ensuring that the ball subsequently scores a goal. This means that the program might output an invalid x-coordinate for `x_w`.

For instance, the calculated `x_w` might be outside the valid range or might not result in the ball scoring a goal, leading to incorrect behavior.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases, making it incorrect.
