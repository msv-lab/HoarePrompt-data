### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Input Parsing and Initial Checks:
- The program correctly reads input from standard input and processes it.
- The main logic is encapsulated in the `func_1` function, which performs several checks to ensure the ball can bounce off the wall and go into the goal.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial Conditions Check:**
   ```python
   if yb + r >= yw or y1 >= y2 or y1 + r >= y2 - r:
       return -1
   ```
   - These conditions check if the ball is already at or beyond the target wall, or if the goalpost height is invalid.
   - This part of the code is correct and necessary.

2. **Midpoint of Goal Check:**
   ```python
   y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2
   if y_goal_mid - r < y1 or y_goal_mid + r > y2:
       return -1
   ```
   - This ensures that the midpoint of the goal is valid.
   - This part of the code is correct and necessary.

3. **Calculation of `x_w`:**
   ```python
   x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)
   ```
   - The formula used here is incorrect. The correct formula for reflection should be:
     \[
     x_w = xb - \frac{2 \cdot (yb - y1) \cdot (xb - 0)}{(y1 - yb)}
     \]
   - The current formula in the code is:
     \[
     x_w = xb - 2 \cdot \frac{(yb - y_goal_mid) \cdot (xb - 0)}{(y_goal_mid - yb)}
     \]
   - The discrepancy in the formula can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the term `(yb - y_goal_mid)` in the numerator should be replaced with `(yb - y1)`.

4. **Final Check and Return:**
   ```python
   if x_w <= 0:
       return -1
   return x_w
   ```
   - This ensures that the calculated `x_w` is positive.
   - This part of the code is correct and necessary.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the formula used to calculate `x_w` is incorrect. The current implementation might return incorrect results due to the mistake in the formula.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

**Explanation:** The program incorrectly calculates the `x_w` value due to a mistake in the reflection formula. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description and requirements.
