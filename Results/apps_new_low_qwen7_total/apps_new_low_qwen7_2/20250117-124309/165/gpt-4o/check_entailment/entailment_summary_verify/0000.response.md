### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program does handle the condition that the ball must bounce exactly once and go straight to the goal. Here's why:

1. **Functionality Check**:
   - The function `func_1` first ensures that the ball is correctly positioned and does not violate the given constraints.
   - If any of the constraints are violated, it returns `-1`.
   - If the constraints are satisfied, it calculates the x-coordinate of the point where the ball should bounce off the wall using the provided formula.

2. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula used in the function `func_1` is derived from the geometric properties of the problem. Specifically, it calculates the x-coordinate of the point on the right wall where the ball should bounce to score a goal.
   - The formula `xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)` is used to find the x-coordinate of the point of impact on the right wall.
   - This formula takes into account the y-coordinate of the midpoint of the goal (`y_goal_mid`), the y-coordinate of the ball (`yb`), and the x-coordinate of the ball (`xb`).

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the ball must bounce off the right wall and score a goal. It ensures that the calculated x-coordinate is within the valid range and does not result in the ball hitting any other part of the wall or the goal posts.
   - The function checks the validity of the calculated x-coordinate before returning it, ensuring that the ball bounces exactly once and goes straight to the goal.

Given the above analysis, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
