### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the program and the problem description step-by-step to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description and Constraints**:
   - Robo-Wallace can only aim to the right wall.
   - The ball must bounce exactly once off the wall and then score a goal.
   - The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic.
   - The goal is scored if the center of the ball crosses the OY axis between \( (0, y_1) \) and \( (0, y_2) \).
   - The ball must not hit any other wall or the goal posts.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if the ball can reach the right wall within the constraints.
   - If the ball cannot reach the right wall under the given conditions, it returns `-1`.
   - The function calculates the x-coordinate \( x_w \) where the ball should bounce off the right wall.
   - The formula used to calculate \( x_w \) is derived from the geometry of the situation, assuming the ball bounces off the wall at a point such that it scores a goal.

3. **Calculation of \( x_w \)**:
   - The function calculates \( y_{\text{goal\_mid}} \) as the midpoint of the goal.
   - The formula for \( x_w \) is derived from the condition that the ball bounces off the wall at \( x_w \) and then travels in a straight line to the goal.

Given the annotations, let's verify the logic:

- The function correctly checks if the ball can reach the right wall.
- The function calculates the correct \( x_w \) using the provided formula.
- The function ensures that the ball does not hit any other wall or the goal posts by checking the conditions before returning \( x_w \).

Now, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:

**Example Input:**
```
4 10 13 10 3 1
```
- \( y1 = 4 \)
- \( y2 = 10 \)
- \( yw = 13 \)
- \( xb = 10 \)
- \( yb = 3 \)
- \( r = 1 \)

- The function correctly calculates \( y_{\text{goal\_mid}} = 7 \).
- The function calculates \( x_w = 4.375 \).

This calculation ensures that the ball bounces off the right wall at \( x_w = 4.375 \) and then travels in a straight line to score a goal. The function handles all the necessary checks and ensures that the ball does not hit any other wall or the goal posts.

Thus, the function correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly calculates the x-coordinate where the ball should bounce off the right wall to score a goal, and it ensures that the ball does not hit any other wall or the goal posts. Therefore, the program is correct.
