Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initial Checks**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and splits it into variables.
   - It then calls `func_1` to determine if Robo-Wallace can score a goal.
   - The function `func_1` performs several checks to ensure the ball can bounce off the wall and reach the goal:
     - `yb + r >= yw`: Ensures the ball is not already at or beyond the target wall.
     - `y1 >= y2` and `y1 + r >= y2 - r`: Ensures the goalpost height is valid.
     - `y_goal_mid - r < y1` or `y_goal_mid + r > y2`: Ensures the midpoint of the goal is valid.

2. **Reflection Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `x_w` using the reflection formula:
     \[
     x_w = xb - 2 \cdot \frac{(yb - y_goal_mid) \cdot (xb - 0)}{(y_goal_mid - yb)}
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the ball bounces off the wall and heads towards the goal.

3. **Edge Cases and Error Handling**:
   - The function returns `-1` if any of the conditions fail, ensuring that the ball cannot score a goal under those circumstances.
   - The final check `if (x_w <= 0)` ensures that `x_w` is a valid position on the right wall, which aligns with the requirement that Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall.

4. **Validation Against Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly reflect the state of the program at key points.
   - Each step in the annotations matches the corresponding logic in the code.
   - The calculations and conditions are consistent with the problem description and the need for Robo-Wallace to hit the ball to the right wall and score a goal.

5. **Correctness of the Implementation**:
   - The program handles all the necessary checks and calculates the correct `x_w` if the conditions are met.
   - The output format and error handling are appropriate.

Given the detailed analysis and the consistency between the code and the problem requirements, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
