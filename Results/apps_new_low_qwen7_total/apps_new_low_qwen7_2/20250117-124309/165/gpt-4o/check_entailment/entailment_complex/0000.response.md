Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the program and the function `func_1` to verify its correctness:

1. **Initial Conditions Check:**
   - The function first checks if the ball can even potentially score a goal after bouncing off the wall. This is done by ensuring the following:
     - `yb + r < yw`: The ball must be below the top of the wall.
     - `y1 < y2 < yw`: The goal posts are correctly positioned.
     - `2Â·r < y2 - y1`: The distance between the goal posts is greater than twice the ball's radius.

2. **Midpoint of Goal:**
   - `y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2`: Calculate the midpoint of the goal.

3. **Midpoint Check:**
   - The function checks if the midpoint of the goal is within the vertical bounds of the goal posts plus/minus the ball's radius.
     - `y_goal_mid - r < y1 or y_goal_mid + r > y2`: If the midpoint is outside the range, it means the ball cannot reach the goal even after bouncing off the wall. Thus, return -1.

4. **Calculation of `x_w`:**
   - If the above conditions pass, the function calculates the required horizontal coordinate `x_w` where the ball should be aimed at.
     - `x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`: This formula is derived from the reflection principle and ensures the ball bounces off the wall and goes straight to the goal.
   - If `x_w <= 0`, it means the calculated point is not valid (i.e., the ball would not bounce off the wall to the right), so return -1.

5. **Return Valid `x_w`:**
   - If all conditions pass, return the calculated `x_w`.

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps, the function correctly handles all edge cases and computes the required `x_w` if possible. Therefore, the provided function and overall logic appear to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
