Reasoning:

1. The program reads input from stdin and processes it using predefined functions.
2. The main logic is contained within `func_1`, which calculates whether Robo-Wallace can score a goal based on the given parameters.
3. The function checks for various conditions to ensure that the ball can bounce off the wall and go into the goal:
    - The ball must not already be at or beyond the target wall (`yb + r >= yw`).
    - The goalpost height must be valid (`y1 >= y2` and `y1 + r >= y2 - r`).
    - The midpoint of the goal must be valid (`y_goal_mid - r < y1` or `y_goal_mid + r > y2`).
4. The calculation of `x_w` uses the formula for reflection:
    \[
    x_w = xb - 2 \cdot \frac{(yb - y_goal_mid) \cdot (xb - 0)}{(y_goal_mid - yb)}
    \]
    This formula ensures that the ball bounces off the wall and goes towards the goal.
5. The function returns `-1` if any condition fails, otherwise, it returns the calculated `x_w`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly implement the solution. The output format and error handling also seem appropriate.

Correctness: **True**
