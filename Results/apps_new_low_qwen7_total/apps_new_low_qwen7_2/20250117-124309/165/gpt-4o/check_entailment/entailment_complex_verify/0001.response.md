### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Validation:**
   - The program reads input and processes it correctly.
   - The function `func_1` validates several conditions:
     - `yb + r >= yw` ensures the ball is not already beyond the target wall.
     - `y1 >= y2` and `y1 + r >= y2 - r` ensure the goalpost height is valid.
     - `y_goal_mid - r < y1` and `y_goal_mid + r > y2` ensure the midpoint of the goal is valid.

2. **Reflection Calculation:**
   - The formula used for calculating `x_w` is:
     \[
     x_w = xb - 2 \cdot \frac{(yb - y_goal_mid) \cdot (xb - 0)}{(y_goal_mid - yb)}
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the principle of reflection, where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function returns `-1` if any of the validation conditions fail, which covers the cases where the ball cannot bounce off the wall and go into the goal.
   - The function also handles the case where the calculated `x_w` is not valid (i.e., `x_w <= 0`).

4. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program prints `-1` if the conditions are not met.
   - Otherwise, it prints `x_w` formatted to 10 decimal places.

5. **Functionality:**
   - The function correctly implements the logic to find a valid `x_w` that allows the ball to bounce off the wall and go into the goal.
   - The formula for `x_w` is derived correctly and takes into account the position of the ball and the wall.

Given the detailed validation and the correct implementation of the reflection principle, the program appears to be functioning as intended. The annotations and the analysis support the original assessment.

### Final:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the given constraints.
