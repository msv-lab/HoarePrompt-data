The function `func_1` accepts six parameters: `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r`. It checks several conditions to ensure the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, and doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. If any of the conditions are violated, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the value of `x_w` using the formula `xb - (2 * yb - y1 - y2) * xb / (y1 + y2 - 2 * yb)`.
