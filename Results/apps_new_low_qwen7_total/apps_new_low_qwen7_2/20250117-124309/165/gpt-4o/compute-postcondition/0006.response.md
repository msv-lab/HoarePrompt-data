Postcondition: **`y1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y1` < `y2` ≤ 10^6, `y2` is an integer such that 1 < `y1` < `y2` ≤ 10^6, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, `r` are integers, `y_goal_mid` is the arithmetic mean of `y1` and `y2`, `y1 < y2 < yw`, `yb + r < yw`, `2·r < y2 - y1`, and the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, and doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at, and the condition `(y_goal_mid - r >= y1 and y_goal_mid + r <= y2)` holds.**
