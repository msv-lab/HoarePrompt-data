`x_w` is assigned the value of `xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`. Given the conditions, let's substitute the known values:

- `y1 < y2 < yw`
- `yb + r < yw`
- `2·r < y2 - y1`

We know that `y_goal_mid` is the arithmetic mean of `y1` and `y2`, so `y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2`.

Substituting `y_goal_mid` into the equation for `x_w`:

\[ x_w = xb - 2 \cdot (yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}) \cdot (xb - 0) / (\frac{y1 + y2}{2} - yb) \]

Simplifying further:

\[ x_w = xb - 2 \cdot \left( \frac{2 \cdot yb - y1 - y2}{2} \right) \cdot xb / \left( \frac{y1 + y2 - 2 \cdot yb}{2} \right) \]

\[ x_w = xb - (2 \cdot yb - y1 - y2) \cdot xb / (y1 + y2 - 2 \cdot yb) \]

This is the updated value for `x_w`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y1` < `y2` ≤ 10^6, `y2` is an integer such that 1 < `y1` < `y2` ≤ 10^6, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, `r` are integers, `y_goal_mid` is the arithmetic mean of `y1` and `y2`, `y1 < y2 < yw`, `yb + r < yw`, `2·r < y2 - y1`, and the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, and doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at, and the condition `(y_goal_mid - r >= y1 and y_goal_mid + r <= y2)` holds; `x_w` is `xb - (2 * yb - y1 - y2) * xb / (y1 + y2 - 2 * yb)`**
