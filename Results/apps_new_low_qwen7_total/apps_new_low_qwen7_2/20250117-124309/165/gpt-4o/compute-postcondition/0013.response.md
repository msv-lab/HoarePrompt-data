Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts six parameters: `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r`. It checks several conditions to ensure the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, and doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. If any of the conditions are violated, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the value of `x_w` using the formula `xb - (2 * yb - y1 - y2) * xb / (y1 + y2 - 2 * yb)`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function includes multiple checks (if blocks) that ensure the ball is within the correct range and doesn't touch or cross any walls. Each check failing results in the function returning -1.
- There is no explicit handling for the case where the denominator `y1 + y2 - 2 * yb` could be zero, which would lead to a division by zero error. This should be considered an edge case and could result in incorrect behavior or an error if not handled properly.
- The function assumes that the inputs meet the initial constraints (`1 ≤ y1, y2, yw, xb, yb ≤ 10^6`, `y1 < y2 < yw`, `yb + r < yw`, `2·r < y2 - y1`). If these constraints are not met, the function may produce unexpected results or raise errors.**

**Final state of the program after conclusion:**
- If none of the conditions fail, the function returns `x_w` calculated as `xb - (2 * yb - y1 - y2) * xb / (y1 + y2 - 2 * yb)`.
- If any of the conditions fail, the function returns -1.
