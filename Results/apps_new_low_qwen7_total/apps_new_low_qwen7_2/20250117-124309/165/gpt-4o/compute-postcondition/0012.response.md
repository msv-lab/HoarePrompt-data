The function `func_1` accepts six parameters: `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r`. All of these parameters are integers with specific constraints: \(1 \leq y1, y2, yw, xb, yb \leq 10^6\), \(y1 < y2 < yw\), \(yb + r < yw\), and \(2 \cdot r < y2 - y1\). Additionally, the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, and doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at.

The function has four cases:
- Case_1: The program returns -1
- Case_2: The program returns -1
- Case_3: The program returns -1
- Case_4: The program returns \(x_w\) which is calculated as \(xb - (2 \cdot yb - y1 - y2) \cdot xb / (y1 + y2 - 2 \cdot yb)\)

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept six integers `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r` under given constraints and return -1 in three cases, and calculate and return \(x_w\) in the fourth case based on the provided formula.
