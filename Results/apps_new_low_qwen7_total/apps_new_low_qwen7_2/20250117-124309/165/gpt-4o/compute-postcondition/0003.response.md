The code calculates `y_goal_mid` as the average of `y1` and `y2`. Given the initial conditions, `y1` and `y2` are integers with specific ranges and relationships. The value of `y_goal_mid` is the arithmetic mean of `y1` and `y2`.

Since `y1` and `y2` are integers, `y_goal_mid` will be a floating-point number. However, the exact value of `y_goal_mid` depends on the specific values of `y1` and `y2`. The only information we have is that `y1 < y2`, so `y_goal_mid` will be a real number between `y1` and `y2`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y1` < `y2` ≤ 10^6, `y2` is an integer such that 1 < `y1` < `y2` ≤ 10^6, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, `r` are integers, `y_goal_mid` is the arithmetic mean of `y1` and `y2`, `y1 < y2 < yw`, `yb + r < yw`, `2·r < y2 - y1`, and the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, and doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at, and (`yb + r < yw` and `y1 < y2` and `y1 + r < y2 - r`).**
