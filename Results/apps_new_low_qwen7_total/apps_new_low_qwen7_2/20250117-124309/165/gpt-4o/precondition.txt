y1, y2, yw, xb, yb, r are integers, where 1 ≤ y1, y2, yw, xb, yb, r ≤ 10^6, y1 < y2 < yw, yb + r < yw, and 2·r < y2 - y1. The ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, and doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts are not located in the field corners.
