Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Since most contestants do not read this part, I have to repeat that Bitlandians are quite weird. They have their own jobs, their own working method, their own lives, their own sausages and their own games!

Since you are so curious about Bitland, I'll give you the chance of peeking at one of these games.

BitLGM and BitAryo are playing yet another of their crazy-looking genius-needed Bitlandish games. They've got a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The players make moves in turns. BitLGM moves first. Each player can and must do one of the two following actions in his turn:

  Take one of the integers (we'll denote it as a_{i}). Choose integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_{i}). And then decrease a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x.  Choose integer x $(1 \leq x \leq \operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. 

The player who cannot make a move loses.

You're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Determine who wins, if both players plays optimally well and if BitLGM and BitAryo start playing the described game in this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 300).


-----Output-----

Write the name of the winner (provided that both players play optimally well). Either "BitLGM" or "BitAryo" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----

# Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    while len(a) > 1:
        if min(a) == 0:
            a.remove(0)
        else:
            x = min(a)
            a = [i - x for i in a]
    if a:
        print('BitLGM' if a[0] % 2 == 0 else 'BitAryo')
    else:
        print('BitAryo')





# Execution Summary:
The function reads an integer \( n \) followed by \( n \) integers. It then removes all zeros from the list and subtracts the minimum non-zero value from each element in the list until only one element remains. If the list becomes empty during the process, it prints "BitAryo". Otherwise, it prints "BitLGM" if the last remaining element is even, and "BitAryo" if it is odd. The function does not return anything; the output is printed directly. Potential edge cases include when \( n = 1 \) and the single integer is zero, in which case the function should print "BitAryo".
