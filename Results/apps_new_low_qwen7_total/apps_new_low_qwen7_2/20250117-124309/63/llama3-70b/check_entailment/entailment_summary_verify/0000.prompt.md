You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Since most contestants do not read this part, I have to repeat that Bitlandians are quite weird. They have their own jobs, their own working method, their own lives, their own sausages and their own games!

Since you are so curious about Bitland, I'll give you the chance of peeking at one of these games.

BitLGM and BitAryo are playing yet another of their crazy-looking genius-needed Bitlandish games. They've got a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The players make moves in turns. BitLGM moves first. Each player can and must do one of the two following actions in his turn:

  Take one of the integers (we'll denote it as a_{i}). Choose integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_{i}). And then decrease a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x.  Choose integer x $(1 \leq x \leq \operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. 

The player who cannot make a move loses.

You're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Determine who wins, if both players plays optimally well and if BitLGM and BitAryo start playing the described game in this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 300).


-----Output-----

Write the name of the winner (provided that both players play optimally well). Either "BitLGM" or "BitAryo" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 1

Output
BitLGM

Input
2
1 2

Output
BitAryo

Input
3
1 2 1

Output
BitLGM

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    while len(a) > 1:
        if min(a) == 0:
            a.remove(0)
        else:
            x = min(a)
            a = [i - x for i in a]
    if a:
        print('BitLGM' if a[0] % 2 == 0 else 'BitAryo')
    else:
        print('BitAryo')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer \( n \) followed by \( n \) integers. It then removes all zeros from the list and subtracts the minimum non-zero value from each element in the list until only one element remains. If the list becomes empty during the process, it prints "BitAryo". Otherwise, it prints "BitLGM" if the last remaining element is even, and "BitAryo" if it is odd. The function does not return anything; the output is printed directly. Potential edge cases include when \( n = 1 \) and the single integer is zero, in which case the function should print "BitAryo".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the game rules and logic. Specifically, the program always removes the smallest element from the list if it is non-zero and repeats until only one element remains or no elements are left. This approach does not account for the second move option, which involves decrementing all elements by the minimum value of all elements, if that minimum value is greater than zero.

For instance, consider the input:
```
2
1 2
```
According to the problem description, BitLGM (the first player) has two options:
1. Decrease the first element (1) by 1, resulting in [0, 2]. Now BitAryo cannot make a valid move because the first element is 0.
2. Decrease all elements by 1, resulting in [0, 1]. Now BitAryo cannot make a valid move because the first element is 0.

In either case, BitLGM wins. However, the provided program incorrectly handles this scenario and would not determine the correct winner.

Another example to illustrate the issue:
```
3
1 2 1
```
Here, BitLGM has the following options:
1. Decrease the first element (1) by 1, resulting in [0, 2, 1]. Now BitAryo cannot make a valid move because the first element is 0.
2. Decrease all elements by 1, resulting in [0, 1, 0]. Now BitAryo cannot make a valid move because the first and third elements are 0.

Again, BitLGM wins, but the program would not handle this correctly.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic, and thus the correctness is **False**.
