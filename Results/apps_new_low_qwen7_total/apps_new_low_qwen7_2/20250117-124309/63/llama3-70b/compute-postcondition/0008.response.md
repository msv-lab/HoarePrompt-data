The code removes the first occurrence of `0` from the list `a`. Since `len(a)` must be greater than 1, the list `a` initially contains at least two elements. After removing `0`, the length of `a` will be reduced by 1, but it will still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `len(a)` is now greater than 0 and less than or equal to the original value of `len(a) - 1`, and the first element of `a` is no longer `0`.

Output State: **`len(a)` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the original value of `len(a) - 1`, and the first element of `a` is no longer 0**
