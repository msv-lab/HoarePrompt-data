Postcondition: ***`a` is a list with length greater than 1. If the minimum value in `a` is 0, the first occurrence of 0 is removed and the new minimum value is 3. Otherwise, each element in `a` is the difference between the original elements and the minimum value in the list (either 0 or the original minimum value minus itself).***
