Initial State: `len(a)` must be greater than 1

Code Block:
```
x = min(a)
a = [(i - x) for i in a]
```

Analysis:
1. The first line, `x = min(a)`, assigns the minimum value in list `a` to the variable `x`.
2. The second line, `a = [(i - x) for i in a]`, creates a new list where each element is the difference between the original element in `a` and `x`, and then assigns this new list back to `a`.

Since `len(a)` must be greater than 1, let's assume `a` is a list such as `[5, 3, 9]` for demonstration purposes (the exact values do not change the nature of the operation, but we need specific values to proceed).

Step-by-step Execution:
1. Calculate `x`:
   - `x = min([5, 3, 9])` => `x = 3`

2. Update `a`:
   - New `a` becomes `[5 - 3, 3 - 3, 9 - 3]` => `[2, 0, 6]`

Final State:
- `a` is now `[2, 0, 6]`
- `x` was calculated but not reassigned in the second line, so it is still `3` (though it's no longer used since `a` has been updated).

Output State: **a is [2, 0, 6], x is 3**
