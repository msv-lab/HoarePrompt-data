To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
- **n**: An integer between 1 and 3.
- **a**: A list of `n` integers, where each integer is between 0 and 299.

### Loop Condition:
```
while len(a) > 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `len(a)` (the length of list `a`) is greater than 1.
2. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 3.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers, each between 0 and 299.

### Key Points:
- For the loop to execute the first time, `len(a)` must be greater than 1.

### Determining the Initial Value of `n`:
- Since `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 because if `n` is 1, then `a` would be a list of length 1, and the loop condition `len(a) > 1` would fail.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop executes the first time, `n` must be at least 2. Therefore, `n` must be either 2 or 3.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 and `n` must be at least 2**
