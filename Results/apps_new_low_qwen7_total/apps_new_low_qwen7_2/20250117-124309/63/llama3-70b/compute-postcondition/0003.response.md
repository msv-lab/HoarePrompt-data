`a` has its first element, which is `0`, removed from the list. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 and must be at least 2, the precondition states that `n` is either 2 or 3. The removal of `0` from the list does not affect the minimum value condition because `0` was the minimum value and it has been removed. 

Output State: **`n` is either 2 or 3; the minimum value in list `a` is now greater than 0**
