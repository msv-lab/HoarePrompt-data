The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, which consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 3`. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` where `0 ≤ a_{i} < 300`. Based on the input, the function will return either a specific integer or a list of integers.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, and returns either a specific integer or a list of integers based on the input values.**
