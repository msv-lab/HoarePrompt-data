The code `a.remove(0)` removes the first occurrence of `0` from the list `a`. Since `min(a)` is either 0 or 3, removing `0` will only affect the list `a`. The length of `a` is greater than 1, and after removing `0`, the smallest element in the list will no longer be `0`. It will be `3` unless there were multiple `0`s and they were the first elements, which is not the case here since the list length is greater than 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list with its first occurrence of `0` removed, and `min(a)` is `3`**
