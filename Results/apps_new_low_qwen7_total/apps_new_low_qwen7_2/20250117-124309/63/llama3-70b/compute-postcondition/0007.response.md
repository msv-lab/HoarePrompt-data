To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions given:

1. The loop continues as long as `len(a) > 1`.
2. We need to ensure that `len(a)` is greater than 1 for the next iteration.

From the given condition:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 and at least 2.
- If the minimum value in list `a` is 0, then `n` remains unchanged and the minimum value in list `a` becomes greater than 0.
- Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged and `a` contains at least one minimum value of 1.

To ensure the loop executes again, we need to guarantee that `len(a) > 1` at the start of the next iteration. However, the values of `n` and the minimum value in `a` do not directly impact the length of the list `a`.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a) > 1`.

Since the problem doesn't provide the current length of `a` but mentions that the loop can continue as long as `len(a) > 1`, we can assume that the length of `a` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

State: **`len(a)` must be greater than 1**
