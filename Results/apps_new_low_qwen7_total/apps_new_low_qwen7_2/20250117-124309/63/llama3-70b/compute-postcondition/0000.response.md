Initial State: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} where 0 ≤ a_{i} < 300.

Code Block:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

Analysis:
- The first line reads an integer `n` from the input and stores it in the variable `n`.
- The second line reads a string of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to a type `int`, and stores them in a list `a`.

Since the actual input values are not provided, we can't specify exact values for `n` and `a`. However, based on the precondition, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 (inclusive), and `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 0 and 299 (inclusive).

Final Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3, a is a list of n integers each between 0 and 299**
