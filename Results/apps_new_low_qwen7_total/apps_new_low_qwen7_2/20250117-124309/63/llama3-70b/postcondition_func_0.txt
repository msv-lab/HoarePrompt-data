The function reads an integer \( n \) followed by \( n \) integers. It then removes all zeros from the list and subtracts the minimum non-zero value from each element in the list until only one element remains. If the list becomes empty during the process, it prints "BitAryo". Otherwise, it prints "BitLGM" if the last remaining element is even, and "BitAryo" if it is odd. The function does not return anything; the output is printed directly. Potential edge cases include when \( n = 1 \) and the single integer is zero, in which case the function should print "BitAryo".
