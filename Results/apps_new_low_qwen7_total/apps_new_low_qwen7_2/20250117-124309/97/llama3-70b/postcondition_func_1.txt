The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `x` (where \(1 \leq x \leq n\)) and returns a list `res` that starts with the initial value of `x`, followed by the intermediate results of repeatedly applying the function `func_1` to `x` until `x` becomes 1. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the list `res` contains `x`, then the results of applying `func_1` to `x` in sequence, ending with 1. This process continues until `x` reaches 1, at which point the loop terminates and the list `res` is returned. Potential edge cases include when `x` is already 1 initially, in which case the list `res` will only contain `[1]`. Additionally, if `func_1` does not reduce `x` to 1 (which is not specified in the given code), the function may enter an infinite loop unless `func_1` eventually maps `x` to 1.
