The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` that is greater than or equal to 1. If `x` is even, the function returns `x // 2`. If `x` is odd, the function returns `x - 1`, ensuring the returned value is always even. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is worth noting that the function correctly handles the case where `x` is 1 (the smallest possible input), returning 0, which is even. The function does not modify any external variables and operates only on the input `x`.
