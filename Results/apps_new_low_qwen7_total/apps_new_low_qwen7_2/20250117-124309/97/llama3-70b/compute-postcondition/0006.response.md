To properly analyze the given code block, we need to know the definitions of `func_1` and the initial value of `x`. However, since these details are not provided, I will assume a general case where `func_1` is a function that takes one argument and returns a value, and `x` is initially a specific value. Let's proceed under this assumption.

Given the code snippet:
```
x = func_1(x)
res.append(x)
```

Let's denote the initial value of `x` as `initial_x`.

1. The first line `x = func_1(x)` calls the function `func_1` with `x` as an argument and assigns the returned value back to `x`.
2. The second line `res.append(x)` appends the current value of `x` (which has been updated by the first line) to the list `res`.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we can represent the final state in a general form.

Final State:
- `x` is the result of `func_1(initial_x)`
- `res` is a list containing at least one element, which is the result of `func_1(initial_x)`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **x is func_1(initial_x), res is [func_1(initial_x)]**
