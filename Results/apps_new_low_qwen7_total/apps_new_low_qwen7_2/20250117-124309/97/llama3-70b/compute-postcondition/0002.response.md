Given the initial state where `x` must be greater than 1 and `res` is a list containing `x`, we need to execute the following code:

```python
x = func_1(x)
res.append(x)
```

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in this context, we cannot determine the exact value it returns. However, we know the following:

1. The value of `x` will be updated to the return value of `func_1(x)`.
2. The updated value of `x` will be appended to the list `res`.

Let's denote the return value of `func_1(x)` as `new_x`. After executing the code, the new value of `x` will be `new_x`, and `new_x` will also be appended to `res`.

Thus, the final state is:
- `x` is now `new_x` (where `new_x` is the return value of `func_1(x)`).
- `res` is now a list containing the original `x` and `new_x`.

Output State: **x is new_x, res is [original x, new_x]**
