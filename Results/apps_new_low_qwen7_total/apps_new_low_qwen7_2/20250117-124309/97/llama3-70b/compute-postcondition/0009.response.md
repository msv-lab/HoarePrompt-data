The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\). The function returns a list `res` that starts with the initial value of `x` which is 1, followed by the results of applying functions to `x` until the final result of the function sequence is 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `x` and return a list `res` starting with `x` and followed by the results of a sequence of function applications until the result is 1.
