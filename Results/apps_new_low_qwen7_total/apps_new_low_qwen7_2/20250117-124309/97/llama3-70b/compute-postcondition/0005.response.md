Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.
2. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `x`.
3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is equal to `func_1(new_x)`.
4. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must not be equal to 1.

Given that `x` is currently `func_1(new_x)`, we need to ensure that `func_1(new_x)` is not equal to 1 for the loop to continue.

Since the loop head only involves the variable `x`, we need to adjust the state such that `x` is not equal to 1.

**State:**
- `x` must not be equal to 1.

However, since `x` is defined as `func_1(new_x)`, and we don't have any additional information about `func_1` other than the current value of `x`, we can only ensure that `x` is not equal to 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`x` must not be equal to 1**
