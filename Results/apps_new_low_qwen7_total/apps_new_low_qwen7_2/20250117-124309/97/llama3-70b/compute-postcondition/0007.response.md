Let's analyze the given loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\).
- `res` is a list containing `x`.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
while x != 1:
    x = func_1(x)
    res.append(x)
```

### Observations and Invariants:
1. **Variable `res`:**
   - `res` starts with `[x]`.
   - During each iteration, `x` is appended to `res`.
   - After the loop ends, `res` will contain all the values of `x` from the start until it reaches 1.

2. **Variable `x`:**
   - The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to 1.
   - Each iteration updates `x` to `func_1(x)`, where `func_1` is an unspecified function.

### Loop Execution Analysis:
- The loop will continue executing until `x` becomes 1.
- Each time the loop runs, `x` is replaced by `func_1(x)`, and this value is added to `res`.

### Output State After the Loop Executes:
- Letâ€™s denote the sequence of operations as follows:
  - Initially, `res = [x]`.
  - After the first iteration: `x = func_1(x)` and `res = [x, func_1(x)]`.
  - After the second iteration: `x = func_1(func_1(x))` and `res = [x, func_1(x), func_1(func_1(x))]`.
  - This process continues until `x` becomes 1.

### Final Output State:
- When `x` finally becomes 1, the loop stops.
- At this point, `res` will contain all intermediate values of `x` from the initial value until `x` becomes 1.

Since the loop terminates when `x` equals 1, the final value of `x` will be 1, and `res` will be a list containing all the values of `x` starting from the initial value until it reaches 1.

### Summary:
- `x` will be 1 when the loop stops.
- `res` will be a list containing all intermediate values of `x` from the initial value until `x` becomes 1.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **x = 1, res = [initial x, func_1(initial x), ..., func_n(initial x) where func_n(initial x) = 1]**.
