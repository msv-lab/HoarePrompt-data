Initial State: `x` is `new_x` and `new_x` must not be equal to 1, `res` is `[original_x, new_x]`

Code Block:
```python
x = func_1(x)
res.append(x)
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `x = func_1(x)` calls the function `func_1` with the current value of `x` (which is `new_x`) and assigns the returned value back to `x`. This means `x` now holds the result of `func_1(new_x)`.
2. The second line `res.append(x)` appends the new value of `x` to the list `res`. Since `x` has been updated in the first line, this means `res` will now contain `[original_x, new_x, func_1(new_x)]`.

Final Output State: **x is func_1(new_x), res is [original_x, new_x, func_1(new_x)]**
