Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while x != 1:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `x` is not equal to 1.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is `new_x` and `res` is `[original x, new_x]`.

3. **Determine Adjustment**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must not be equal to 1. Therefore, `new_x` must not be equal to 1.

4. **Adjustment Needed**: We need to ensure that `new_x` is not equal to 1 for the loop to continue.

**Final State**:
State: **`x` is new_x and new_x must not be equal to 1, `res` is [original x, new_x]**
