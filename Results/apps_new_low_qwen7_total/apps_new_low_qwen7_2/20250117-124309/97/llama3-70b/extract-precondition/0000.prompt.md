You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: At first, let's define function $f(x)$ as follows: $$ \begin{matrix} f(x) & = & \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{x}{2} & \mbox{if } x \text{ is even} \\ x - 1 & \mbox{otherwise } \end{matrix} \right. \end{matrix} $$

We can see that if we choose some value $v$ and will apply function $f$ to it, then apply $f$ to $f(v)$, and so on, we'll eventually get $1$. Let's write down all values we get in this process in a list and denote this list as $path(v)$. For example, $path(1) = [1]$, $path(15) = [15, 14, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1]$, $path(32) = [32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]$.

Let's write all lists $path(x)$ for every $x$ from $1$ to $n$. The question is next: what is the maximum value $y$ such that $y$ is contained in at least $k$ different lists $path(x)$?

Formally speaking, you need to find maximum $y$ such that $\left| \{ x ~|~ 1 \le x \le n, y \in path(x) \} \right| \ge k$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 10^{18}$).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer â€” the maximum value that is contained in at least $k$ paths.


-----Examples-----
Input
11 3

Output
5

Input
11 6

Output
4

Input
20 20

Output
1

Input
14 5

Output
6

Input
1000000 100

Output
31248



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $5$, since $5$ occurs in $path(5)$, $path(10)$ and $path(11)$.

In the second example, the answer is $4$, since $4$ occurs in $path(4)$, $path(5)$, $path(8)$, $path(9)$, $path(10)$ and $path(11)$.

In the third example $n = k$, so the answer is $1$, since $1$ is the only number occuring in all paths for integers from $1$ to $20$.
Program:
```
def func_2(x):
    res = [x]
    while x != 1:
        x = func_1(x)
        res.append(x)
    return res
```
