#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
def func_1(x):
    if (x % 2 == 0) :
        return x // 2
        #The program returns x // 2, where x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and even
    else :
        return x - 1
        #The program returns an even integer which is x - 1, where x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and x is odd
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` that is greater than or equal to 1. If `x` is even, the function returns `x // 2`. If `x` is odd, the function returns `x - 1`, ensuring the returned value is always even. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is worth noting that the function correctly handles the case where `x` is 1 (the smallest possible input), returning 0, which is even. The function does not modify any external variables and operates only on the input `x`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
def func_2(x):
    res = [x]
    while x != 1:
        x = func_1(x)
        
        res.append(x)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: x = 1, res = [initial x, func_1(initial x), ..., func_n(initial x) where func_n(initial x) = 1]
    return res
    #The program returns a list 'res' that starts with the initial value of 'x' which is 1, followed by the results of applying functions to 'x' until the final result of the function sequence is 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `x` (where \(1 \leq x \leq n\)) and returns a list `res` that starts with the initial value of `x`, followed by the intermediate results of repeatedly applying the function `func_1` to `x` until `x` becomes 1. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the list `res` contains `x`, then the results of applying `func_1` to `x` in sequence, ending with 1. This process continues until `x` reaches 1, at which point the loop terminates and the list `res` is returned. Potential edge cases include when `x` is already 1 initially, in which case the list `res` will only contain `[1]`. Additionally, if `func_1` does not reduce `x` to 1 (which is not specified in the given code), the function may enter an infinite loop unless `func_1` eventually maps `x` to 1.
