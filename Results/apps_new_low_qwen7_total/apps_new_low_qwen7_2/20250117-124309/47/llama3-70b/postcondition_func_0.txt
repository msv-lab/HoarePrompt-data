The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000 \). It then counts the number of pairs \((x, y)\) where \( 1 \leq x \leq n \), \( 1 \leq y \leq m \), and the sum \( x + y \) is divisible by 5. The function prints the count of such pairs. If either \( n \) or \( m \) is less than 5, the count is adjusted accordingly. After execution, the function returns the count of valid pairs, and the original values of \( n \) and \( m \) remain unchanged.
