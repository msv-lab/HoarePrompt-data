Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
After finishing eating her bun, Alyona came up with two integers n and m. She decided to write down two columns of integers — the first column containing integers from 1 to n and the second containing integers from 1 to m. Now the girl wants to count how many pairs of integers she can choose, one from the first column and the other from the second column, such that their sum is divisible by 5.

Formally, Alyona wants to count the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and $(x + y) \operatorname{mod} 5$ equals 0.

As usual, Alyona has some troubles and asks you to help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and (x + y) is divisible by 5.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 12

Output
14

Input
11 14

Output
31

Input
1 5

Output
1

Input
3 8

Output
5

Input
5 7

Output
7

Input
21 21

Output
88



-----Note-----

Following pairs are suitable in the first sample case:   for x = 1 fits y equal to 4 or 9;  for x = 2 fits y equal to 3 or 8;  for x = 3 fits y equal to 2, 7 or 12;  for x = 4 fits y equal to 1, 6 or 11;  for x = 5 fits y equal to 5 or 10;  for x = 6 fits y equal to 4 or 9. 

Only the pair (1, 4) is suitable in the third sample case.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

count = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(1, m + 1):
            if (x + y) % 5 == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count` is `floor(n/5) * m + floor(m/5) * n + floor((n mod 5 + m mod 5)/5)`, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `m + 1`, and both `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
    print(count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000 \). It then counts the number of pairs \((x, y)\) where \( 1 \leq x \leq n \), \( 1 \leq y \leq m \), and the sum \( x + y \) is divisible by 5. The function prints the count of such pairs. If either \( n \) or \( m \) is less than 5, the count is adjusted accordingly. After execution, the function returns the count of valid pairs, and the original values of \( n \) and \( m \) remain unchanged.
