Reasoning:
The provided program iterates through all possible pairs of integers (x, y) where \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\). For each pair, it checks if the sum \(x + y\) is divisible by 5. If so, it increments the counter `count`. Finally, it prints the total count.

Given the constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\), this brute-force approach will work correctly within the limits of time and space for the given input size. The logic implemented matches the problem statement exactly, ensuring that all pairs meeting the criteria are counted.

Since the solution directly follows the problem's requirements without any logical errors or misinterpretations, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
