The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is `n + k` + 1, so after the increment, the new value of `count` is `(n + k) + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `n + k + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 3, `count` is `n + k + 2`, `y` is 1, `m` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is 3, `count` is `n + k + 2`, `y` is 1, `m` is 1**
