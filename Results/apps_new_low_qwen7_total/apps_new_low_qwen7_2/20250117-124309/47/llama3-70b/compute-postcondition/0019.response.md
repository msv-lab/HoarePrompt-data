The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial value of `count` is `n + 1`. After incrementing, `count` becomes `(n + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 2`.

All other variables (`x`, `y`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial values. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is 2, `count` is `n + 2`, `y` is `n + 1`, `m` must be at least `n`**
