The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Given the initial state where `count` is `n + 2`, after executing the code, `count` will be `(n + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 3`. The values of the other variables (`x`, `y`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `count` is `n + 3`, `y` is `n + 2`, and `m` must be at least `n`**
