Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves three variables: `y`, `m`, and implicitly `range(1, m + 1)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over values of `y` starting from 1 up to `m + 1 - 1` (since the range function is exclusive on the upper bound).

3. **Determine the initial state of `y`**: For the loop to execute the first time, `y` must be 1. This is because the range starts from 1.

4. **Determine the value of `m`**: Since `y` is in the range `1` to `m + 1`, for `y` to be 1, `m` must be at least 1. However, we know from the given information that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1,000,000, but there is no direct mention of `m` in the problem statement. Therefore, `m` should be at least 1 to allow `y` to be 1.

5. **Check other variables**: The variables `x` and `count` are not directly involved in controlling the loop's execution. They might change inside the loop, but they don't affect the initial loop condition.

Given this analysis, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time must be:

- `y` must be 1.
- `m` must be at least 1.

Since `n` is a positive integer and not directly involved in the loop condition, we do not need to explicitly mention it in the final state. 

So, the required state is:

State: **`x` is 1, `count` is 0, `y` is 1, `m` must be at least 1**
