Functionality: **The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000 \). It then counts the number of pairs \((x, y)\) where \( 1 \leq x \leq n \), \( 1 \leq y \leq m \), and the sum \( x + y \) is divisible by 5. The function prints the count of such pairs. If either \( n \) or \( m \) is less than 5, the count is adjusted accordingly. After execution, the function returns the count of valid pairs, and the original values of \( n \) and \( m \) remain unchanged.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If either \( n \) or \( m \) is less than 5, the count should be adjusted to include only the valid pairs within the given range, which is \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor \times m + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{5} \right\rfloor \times n + \left\lfloor \frac{(n \mod 5 + m \mod 5)}{5} \right\rfloor \).

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations mention that \( x \) and \( y \) are set to \( n + 1 \) and \( m + 1 \) respectively after the for loop, but the code does not actually change these variables. Therefore, the final values of \( x \) and \( y \) after the function execution are still \( n + 1 \) and \( m + 1 \), respectively.
