To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k < n\).
- `seen_remainders` is an empty set.
- The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `k`.

### Loop Head Analysis:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial Conditions:
- `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `k + 1`.
- Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to check if this initial value of `i` falls within the specified range of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Range Check**: The loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `k` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will execute the first time when `i` is 1.
2. **Variables Involved**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.
3. **Initial Value of `i`**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1.
4. **Value of `k`**: `k` must be at least 1 because the loop condition is `1 <= i <= k`. However, since `k < n` and both `k` and `n` are non-negative integers with specific bounds, the exact value of `k` is not strictly necessary for the loop to start but must satisfy the condition `1 <= k`.

### Final State:
Based on the above reasoning, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time must be:

- `i` is 1.
- `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\)**
