The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). 

- In Case_1, the program returns 'No'.
- In Case_2, the program returns 'No'.
- In Case_3, the program returns 'No'.
- In Case_4, the program returns 'No'.
- In Case_5, the program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `n` and `k` and return 'Yes' under specific conditions (represented by Case_5), and 'No' in all other cases.
