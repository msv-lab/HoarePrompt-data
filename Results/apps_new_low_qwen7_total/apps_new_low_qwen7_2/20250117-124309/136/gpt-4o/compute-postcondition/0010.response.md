Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 1
- `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\)
- `remainder` is 0
- `seen_remainders` contains the element `remainder`

### For Loop Head
```
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
3. **Incrementing `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates, the next value of `i` would be 2.
4. **Checking Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition checks if `i < k + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1 and `k` is a valid integer where \(1 \leq k < n\), the condition `1 < k + 1` will always be true unless `k` is 0, which contradicts the given condition \(1 \leq k < n\).

Since the loop condition will continue to hold true (as long as `k` remains valid), the loop will execute again with `i` incremented to 2.

### Adjusted States
- `i` will be 2.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `remainder` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `seen_remainders` still contains the element `remainder` because the loop does not modify this list.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `remainder` is 0, `seen_remainders` contains the element `remainder`**
