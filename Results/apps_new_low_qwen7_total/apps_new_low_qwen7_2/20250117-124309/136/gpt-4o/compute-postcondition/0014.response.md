The code `seen_remainders.add(remainder)` adds the `remainder` to the set `seen_remainders`. Since `remainder` is already in `seen_remainders`, this operation does not add any new element to the set. However, it will check if `remainder` is already present in `seen_remainders`. Given the precondition that `remainder` is already in `seen_remainders`, the set remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `remainder` is 0 or 1, `seen_remainders` contains the elements `remainder`, and the function returns 'No' if `remainder` is in `seen_remainders` (which it is); otherwise, it does not return anything.**
