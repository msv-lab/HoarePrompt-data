Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `remainder` is 0 or 1, `seen_remainders` contains the element `remainder`, and the function returns 'No' if `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`; otherwise, it does not return anything (since there is no else part specified).***
