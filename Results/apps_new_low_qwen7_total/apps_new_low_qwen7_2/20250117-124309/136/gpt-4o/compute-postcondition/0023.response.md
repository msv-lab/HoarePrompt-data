Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `k` as parameters, where both `n` and `k` are constrained such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). It checks whether the remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k` are unique. If any remainder repeats, the function returns 'No'. If all remainders are unique, the function returns 'Yes'.**

- **Case 1**: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function immediately returns 'No'.
- **Case 2**: If during the iteration through the range from 1 to `k`, any remainder previously seen in `seen_remainders` is encountered again, the function returns 'No'.
- **Case 3**: If all remainders from `n % 1` to `n % k` are unique, the function returns 'Yes'.
- **Case 4**: This case is not explicitly covered in the provided annotations, but based on the logic of the function, it would also fall into one of the existing cases (either 'No' or 'Yes').

The function ensures that no repeated remainders occur for the given range and checks this condition to decide between returning 'No' or 'Yes'. All edge cases and the core logic of the function are summarized above.
