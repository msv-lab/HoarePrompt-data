Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
   - `remainder` is 0 or 1.
   - `seen_remainders` contains the element `remainder`.
   - The function returns 'No' if `remainder` is in `seen_remainders` (which it is).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` from 1 to `k` inclusive.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - The condition \(1 \leq k < n\) means `k` remains unchanged.
   - Since `remainder` is already in `seen_remainders`, it will still be there for the next iteration.
   - The function returns 'No' based on the presence of `remainder` in `seen_remainders`, which will still be true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the only variable that changes is `i`.

**State: **`i` is 3, `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `remainder` is 0 or 1, `seen_remainders` contains the elements `remainder`, and the function returns 'No' if `remainder` is in `seen_remainders` (which it is)**.
