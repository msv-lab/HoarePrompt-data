Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = k`. For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` and checks if this remainder has already been seen. If the remainder has been seen before, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the remainder is added to the set `seen_remainders`.

### Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: `k` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **Variable `i`**: Changes from 1 to `k`.
- **Variable `remainder`**: Changes based on the value of `n % i`.
- **Set `seen_remainders`**: Grows as the loop iterates, adding new remainders that haven't been seen before.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop will execute exactly `k` times, from `i = 1` to `i = k`.
- During each iteration, the remainder `n % i` is checked against the set `seen_remainders`.
- If a remainder is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No' immediately and exits the loop.
- If no duplicates are found by the end of the loop, the function returns 'Yes' after all iterations.

### Verify Relationships
- After the loop completes, `seen_remainders` will contain all unique remainders of `n` modulo the integers from 1 to `k`.
- Since the loop does not return 'No', it implies that no duplicate remainders were found within the specified range.

### Final Output State
After the loop executes, if it does not return 'No', the function will return 'Yes'. The variables will be:
- `i`: `k + 1` (one past the last iteration)
- `k`: the same value as the input
- `remainder`: irrelevant since the loop has completed
- `seen_remainders`: a set containing unique remainders from `n % 1` to `n % k`

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `remainder` is irrelevant, `seen_remainders` is a set containing unique remainders from `n % 1` to `n % k` and the function returns 'Yes'.**
