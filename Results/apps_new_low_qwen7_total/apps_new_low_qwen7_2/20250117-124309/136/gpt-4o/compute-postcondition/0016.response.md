The code snippet assigns the value of `n % i` to the variable `remainder`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1. Since `remainder` is already 0 or 1 and is in `seen_remainders`, the condition `remainder` is in `seen_remainders` is true, which means the function returns 'No'.

However, since the problem statement does not involve a function returning 'No', we focus on updating the values of the variables. The value of `remainder` will be updated to `n % i`, but since the initial value of `remainder` is 0 or 1 and it remains the same, the value of `remainder` stays as 0 or 1.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `remainder` is 0 or 1, `seen_remainders` contains the elements 0 or 1, the value of `remainder` is updated to `n % i` which is 0 or 1.**
