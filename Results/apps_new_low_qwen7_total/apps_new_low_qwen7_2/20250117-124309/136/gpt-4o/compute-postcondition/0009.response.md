The code adds the `remainder` to the set `seen_remainders`. Since `remainder` is not already in `seen_remainders`, it will be added to the set. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `remainder`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `remainder` is 0, `seen_remainders` contains the element `remainder`**
