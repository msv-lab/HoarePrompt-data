The code calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by `i`. Given that `i` is 1, the remainder of any number `n` divided by 1 is always 0. Therefore, `remainder` is assigned the value 0. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `remainder` is 0**
