Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `remainder` is 0 or 1, `seen_remainders` contains the elements 0 or 1, the value of `remainder` is updated to `n % i` which is 0 or 1, and the program returns 'No' if `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything (since there is no else part).***
