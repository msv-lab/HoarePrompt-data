The code adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen_remainders`. Since `remainder` is either 0 or 1, the set `seen_remainders` will now include this value. The states of the other variables (`i`, `k`, `remainder`) remain unchanged, but the condition that checks if `remainder` is in `seen_remainders` has been handled.

Given the precondition:
- `i` is 3,
- `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\),
- `remainder` is 0 or 1,
- `seen_remainders` contains the elements 0 or 1,
- `remainder` is updated to `n % i` which is 0 or 1,
- The program returns 'No' if `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.

After executing `seen_remainders.add(remainder)`, the value of `seen_remainders` will include the current value of `remainder`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `remainder` is 0 or 1, `seen_remainders` contains the elements 0 or 1 and includes the current value of `remainder`, the program does not return anything.**
