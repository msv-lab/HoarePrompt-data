The code initializes a set named `seen_remainders`. This set will be used to store remainders, but at this point, no remainders have been added to it yet. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and k < n, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
