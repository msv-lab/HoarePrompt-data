The code updates the value of `remainder` to be the result of `n % i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\). Since the value of `n` is not specified, we will consider the general case where `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. The initial value of `remainder` is 0.

After executing the line `remainder = n % i`, the value of `remainder` will be the result of \(n \mod 2\). Since `i` is 2, the possible values for `remainder` are 0 or 1 depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a valid non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `remainder` is 0 or 1 (depending on the value of `n`), `seen_remainders` contains the element `remainder`**
