The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `k` as parameters, where both `n` and `k` are constrained such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). It checks whether the remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k` are unique. If any remainder repeats, the function returns 'No'. If all remainders are unique, the function returns 'Yes'.
