Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's go through the reasoning step-by-step to confirm:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the base case where \( k \geq n \). In this scenario, the program returns 'No' because the modulus operation with \( n \) will always result in 0 when \( i = n \), and there will be at least one repeated remainder (0).

2. **Set Usage**: The use of a set (`seen_remainders`) to track unique remainders is appropriate. Each time a new remainder is encountered, it is checked against the set. If the remainder is already in the set, the function returns 'No', indicating that the remainders are not all distinct. Otherwise, the remainder is added to the set, and the process continues.

3. **Range Check**: The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \) inclusively, covering all possible divisors from which remainders could be derived. This ensures that the function checks all necessary conditions.

4. **Edge Cases**: The implementation correctly handles edge cases such as when \( n \) and \( k \) are very large, within the given constraints. The program efficiently uses a set to ensure that duplicate remainders are detected.

Given that the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all relevant cases, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
