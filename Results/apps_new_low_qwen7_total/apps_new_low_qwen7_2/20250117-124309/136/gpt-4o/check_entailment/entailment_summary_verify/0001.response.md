Reasoning:

1. The given program correctly implements the logic required to check if all remainders of \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct.
2. The function `func_1` handles the edge case where \( k \geq n \), returning "No" since it's impossible for all remainders to be distinct in this scenario.
3. The use of a set `seen_remainders` ensures that the program efficiently tracks unique remainders.
4. The program iterates through each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( k \), calculating the remainder of \( n \div i \).
5. If a remainder is already present in the set, the function immediately returns "No".
6. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the function returns "Yes".

The provided function summary aligns with the actual implementation of the program. The program correctly checks for distinct remainders using the described logic. The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
