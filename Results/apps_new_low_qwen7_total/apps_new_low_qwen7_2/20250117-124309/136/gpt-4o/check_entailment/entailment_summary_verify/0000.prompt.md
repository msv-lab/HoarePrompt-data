You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Imp is watching a documentary about cave painting. [Image] 

Some numbers, carved in chaotic order, immediately attracted his attention. Imp rapidly proposed a guess that they are the remainders of division of a number n by all integers i from 1 to k. Unfortunately, there are too many integers to analyze for Imp.

Imp wants you to check whether all these remainders are distinct. Formally, he wants to check, if all $n \text{mod} i$, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct, i. e. there is no such pair (i, j) that:   1 ≤ i < j ≤ k,  $n \operatorname{mod} i = n \operatorname{mod} j$, where $x \operatorname{mod} y$ is the remainder of division x by y. 


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Print "Yes", if all the remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise.

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (lower or upper).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4

Output
No

Input
5 3

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample remainders modulo 1 and 4 coincide.

- Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `k` as parameters, where both `n` and `k` are constrained such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). It checks whether the remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k` are unique. If any remainder repeats, the function returns 'No'. If all remainders are unique, the function returns 'Yes'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if all remainders of \( n \) modulo \( i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. Here's why:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function handles the base case where \( k \geq n \) by immediately returning 'No'. This is because if \( k \geq n \), the modulus operation will repeat values due to the nature of remainders.

2. **Set Usage**: A set `seen_remainders` is used to keep track of unique remainders. If a remainder has already been seen, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set and continues.

3. **Range Check**: The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \) inclusively, ensuring all possible remainders are checked.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program works correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range. There are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements based on the given problem description.
