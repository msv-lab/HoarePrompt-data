Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to check if all remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k` are distinct. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This handles the input as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters `n` and `k` and checks for unique remainders.
   - **Base Case**: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function immediately returns 'No', which is correct because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, at least one of the remainders will be zero, leading to a non-distinct set of remainders.
   - **Set Initialization**: A set `seen_remainders` is initialized to keep track of the remainders encountered so far.
   - **Loop Through Divisors**: The program iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `k`.
     - For each `i`, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` and checks if this remainder has already been seen.
     - If a repeated remainder is found, the function returns 'No'.
     - If all remainders are unique, the function adds the new remainder to the set and continues.
   - **Final Check**: If the loop completes without finding any repeated remainders, the function returns 'Yes'.

Given that the logic inside `func_1` accurately follows the problem requirements and the input handling is correct, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
