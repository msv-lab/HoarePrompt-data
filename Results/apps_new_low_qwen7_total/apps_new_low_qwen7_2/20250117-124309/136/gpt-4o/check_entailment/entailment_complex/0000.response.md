Reasoning:

The given program correctly implements the logic to check whether all the remainders of dividing \( n \) by integers from 1 to \( k \) are distinct. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input and passes them to the function `func_1`.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` first checks if \( k \geq n \). If true, it immediately returns 'No' because it is impossible for \( n \) to have distinct remainders when divided by every integer from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - Otherwise, it initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders encountered.
   - It iterates over each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( k \), calculates the remainder of \( n \) divided by \( i \), and checks if this remainder has already been seen. If it has, the function returns 'No'.
   - If the remainder is not seen before, it adds it to the set and continues.
   - After the loop, if no repeated remainders were found, the function returns 'Yes'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The edge case where \( k \geq n \) is handled correctly by returning 'No'.
   - The use of a set to store remainders ensures that duplicates are detected and handled appropriately.
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18} \) are respected by the logic implemented.

Given that the logic follows the requirements and edge cases are handled correctly, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
