### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step using the annotated code and the original assessment.

#### Input and Initial Setup
The program starts by reading two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input and calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

#### Function `func_1`
1. **Base Case Handling**
   - If \( k \geq n \), the function immediately returns 'No'. This is because if \( k \geq n \), the remainders will start repeating due to the nature of the modulus operation. For example, if \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 4 \), the remainders for \( 4 \mod 1, 4 \mod 2, 4 \mod 3, 4 \mod 4 \) are \( 0, 0, 1, 0 \), which are not distinct.
   - This part of the logic is correct as it correctly identifies when the remainders cannot be distinct.

2. **Set Usage and Remainder Checking**
   - A set `seen_remainders` is used to keep track of unique remainders.
   - For each \( i \) from 1 to \( k \):
     - Calculate the remainder \( n \% i \).
     - Check if this remainder is already in `seen_remainders`. If it is, return 'No' immediately.
     - Otherwise, add the remainder to `seen_remainders`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any repeated remainders, return 'Yes'.

This logic ensures that all remainders are checked and if any remainder repeats, the function returns 'No' early. If no repetition is found, it returns 'Yes' after the loop.

#### Annotated Code Analysis
The annotations provided are consistent with the described logic. They correctly describe the state transitions and outcomes of the function.

#### Correctness Evaluation
- **Base Case Handling**: Correctly handles the case where \( k \geq n \) by returning 'No'.
- **Remainder Checking**: Correctly uses a set to track unique remainders and checks for repetitions.
- **Loop Range**: Correctly iterates over the range from 1 to \( k \).

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the program indeed checks if all remainders are distinct and handles edge cases appropriately.

#### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if all remainders of \( n \) modulo \( i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
