### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call:**
   - The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input and calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Edge Case Handling:**
     - If \( k \geq n \), the function returns 'No'. This is because if \( k \geq n \), it's impossible for all remainders \( n \mod i \) to be distinct for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \). This is a valid edge case and correctly handled.
   
   - **Set Initialization:**
     - A set `seen_remainders` is initialized to keep track of unique remainders.
   
   - **Loop Through Possible Remainders:**
     - The loop iterates over all integers \( i \) from 1 to \( k \).
     - For each \( i \), it calculates the remainder \( n \% i \).
     - If the remainder has already been seen (i.e., it exists in the `seen_remainders` set), the function immediately returns 'No', indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
     - Otherwise, the remainder is added to the `seen_remainders` set.
   
   - **Final Return:**
     - If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders are distinct.

The annotated code aligns with the described behavior and correctly reflects the logic of the function. The program correctly handles the edge case and uses a set to ensure all remainders are distinct.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the thorough analysis and the alignment of the program's behavior with the problem requirements, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
