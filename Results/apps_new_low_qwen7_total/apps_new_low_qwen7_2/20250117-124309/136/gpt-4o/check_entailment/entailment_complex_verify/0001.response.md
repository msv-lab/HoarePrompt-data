### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and behavior of the given program. Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, which is correctly handled using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The function `func_1` first checks if \( k \geq n \). If true, it returns "No". This is a correct edge case because if \( k \geq n \), it's impossible for all remainders to be distinct since \( n \mod i \) for \( i \leq n \) will always include at least one zero (when \( i = n \)).

3. **Set Usage**: The program uses a set `seen_remainders` to keep track of unique remainders. This is an efficient way to check for duplicates.

4. **Loop Execution**: The for loop iterates over all integers from 1 to \( k \). For each \( i \):
   - It calculates the remainder \( n \% i \).
   - Checks if this remainder is already in the set `seen_remainders`.
   - If the remainder is already in the set, it means a duplicate has been found, and the function returns "No".
   - Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set.

5. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the function returns "Yes".

Given this detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all edge cases properly. The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

### Final:
**True**
