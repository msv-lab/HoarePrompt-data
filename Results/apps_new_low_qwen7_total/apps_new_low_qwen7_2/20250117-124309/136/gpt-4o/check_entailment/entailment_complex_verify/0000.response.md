### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the annotated code step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input using `map(int, input().split())` which ensures that `n` and `k` are integers.
   - The annotated code correctly states that `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).

2. **Base Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if \( k \geq n \) and returns 'No' immediately. This is a valid base case because if \( k \geq n \), the modulus operation will repeat values, making it impossible for all remainders to be unique.

3. **Set Usage**:
   - A set `seen_remainders` is used to keep track of unique remainders. This is a correct approach as sets do not allow duplicate elements.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \) and for each \( i \), it calculates the remainder of \( n \) divided by \( i \) using `n % i`.
   - If the remainder is already in the set `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No' immediately, indicating that the remainders are not all unique.
   - If the remainder is not in the set, it adds the remainder to the set and continues the loop.

4. **Loop Completion**:
   - After the loop completes, the function returns 'Yes' if no duplicate remainders were found, meaning all remainders are unique.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to check if all remainders of \( n \) modulo \( i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. The annotated code accurately reflects the state of the program at critical points and supports the correctness of the implementation.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided analysis.
