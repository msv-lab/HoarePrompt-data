Reasoning:

1. The given program correctly implements the logic required to check if all remainders of \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct.
2. It handles the edge case where \( k \geq n \), returning "No" since it's impossible for all remainders to be distinct in this scenario.
3. It uses a set `seen_remainders` to keep track of remainders encountered so far.
4. For each \( i \) from 1 to \( k \), it calculates the remainder of \( n \div i \).
5. If a remainder has already been seen, it immediately returns "No".
6. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set and continues.
7. If no duplicate remainders are found, it returns "Yes".

Given the above points, the program accurately follows the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
