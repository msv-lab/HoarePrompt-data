Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly checks if all the remainders of `n` divided by all integers from 1 to `k` are distinct. Here's the breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This ensures that the inputs are parsed and converted into integers.

2. **Initial Check**: 
   - The function `func_1` first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, it returns 'No'. This is correct because if `k >= n`, at least one of the remainders will be 0, and since there are multiple divisions by the same number (`n` itself), the remainders cannot be all distinct. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 4`, the remainders would be `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.

3. **Tracking Remainders**:
   - A set named `seen_remainders` is used to keep track of the remainders. A set inherently stores unique values, so any duplicate remainder will make the set's size smaller than the number of iterations in the loop.
   - The loop iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `k` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, the remainder when `n` is divided by `i` is calculated and checked against the `seen_remainders` set.
   - If a remainder is already in the set, the function returns 'No' immediately, indicating that the remainders are not all distinct.
   - Otherwise, the remainder is added to the set.
   
4. **Final Return**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders are distinct.

Given this analysis, the logic implemented in the provided code accurately solves the problem as stated. Therefore, the given program is correct.
