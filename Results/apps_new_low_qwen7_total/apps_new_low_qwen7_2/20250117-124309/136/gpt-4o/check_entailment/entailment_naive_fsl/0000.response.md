Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if all remainders of \( n \) modulo \( i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. Here's why:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function handles the base case where \( k \geq n \) by immediately returning 'No'. This is because if \( k \geq n \), the modulus operation will repeat values due to the nature of remainders.

2. **Set Usage**: A set `seen_remainders` is used to keep track of unique remainders. If a remainder has already been seen, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set and continues.

3. **Range Check**: The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \) inclusively, ensuring all possible remainders are checked.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program works correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range. There are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements based on the given problem description.
