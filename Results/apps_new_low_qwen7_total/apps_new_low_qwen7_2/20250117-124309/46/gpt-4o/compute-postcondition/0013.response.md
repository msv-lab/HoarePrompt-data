Initial State: `sequence[k-1]` is `initial_value + 1`, `remainder` is `initial_remainder - 1`, `k` is a positive integer, and `i` is `k-3`.

Code Block:
```
sequence[i] += 1
remainder -= 1
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `sequence[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the `sequence` list by 1. Since `i` is `k-3`, this means `sequence[k-3]` will be incremented by 1. Initially, `sequence[k-1]` is `initial_value + 1`.
2. The second line `remainder -= 1` decrements the value of `remainder` by 1. Initially, `remainder` is `initial_remainder - 1`.

Since the exact values of `initial_value` and `initial_remainder` are not specified, we will use the provided relationships and perform the operations based on the given initial states.

After executing the code block:
- `sequence[k-3]` will be `sequence[k-1] + 1` because it was initially `initial_value + 1` and then incremented by 1.
- `remainder` will be `remainder - 1` because it was initially `initial_remainder - 1` and then decremented by 1.

Output State: **sequence[k-3] is initial_value + 2, remainder is initial_remainder - 2, k is a positive integer, and i is k-3**
