The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\).

- If a certain condition results in the program returning -1, then the function returns -1.
- Otherwise, the function returns a list sequence where each element `sequence[i]` is calculated as `floor(n / (k * (k + 1) // 2)) * (i + 1) + i` and the remainder is 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` and return either -1 under certain conditions or a list sequence based on the given formula.
