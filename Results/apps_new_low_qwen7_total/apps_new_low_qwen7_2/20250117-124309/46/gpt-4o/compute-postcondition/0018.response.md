Let's analyze the given Python loop step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State

The initial state is defined as follows:
- \( n \) is a positive integer.
- \( k \) is a positive integer.
- \( \text{min\_sum} = k \times (k + 1) // 2 \).
- \( d = n // \text{min\_sum} \).
- \( \text{remainder} = n - d \times \text{min\_sum} \).
- `sequence` is a list of \( k \) elements where each element is \( d \times (i + 1) \) for \( i \) in range \( k \).

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes

- The variable \( \text{min\_sum} \) remains constant because it is derived from \( k \), which is a positive integer and does not change.
- \( d \) changes based on the value of \( n \) and \( \text{min\_sum} \), but once set, it remains constant within the loop.
- \( \text{remainder} \) decreases by 1 each time the loop iterates.
- \( \text{sequence} \) is modified inside the loop by incrementing elements starting from the end of the list until the remainder is 0.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior

The loop runs from \( i = k - 1 \) down to 0. For each iteration, it increments the element at index \( i \) by 1 and decreases the remainder by 1. The loop stops when the remainder becomes 0.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships

From the provided outputs, we can infer that the loop continues to decrement the remainder and increment the corresponding elements in the sequence until the remainder reaches 0. Each time the loop runs, one element in the sequence is incremented.

To generalize, after the loop has executed \( r \) times, where \( r \leq k \), the following holds:
- \( \text{sequence}[k - 1 - r] \) will have its value increased by \( r \).
- The remainder will be \( \text{initial\_remainder} - r \).

### Calculate the Final Output State

Assuming the loop runs exactly \( k \) times (since it would stop when the remainder is 0, and initially, the remainder is \( \text{remainder} \)):

- After \( k \) iterations, the sequence will be modified such that:
  - \( \text{sequence}[k-1] \) will have its value increased by \( k \).
  - \( \text{sequence}[k-2] \) will have its value increased by \( k-1 \).
  - ...
  - \( \text{sequence}[0] \) will have its value increased by 1.

Thus, the final state of the sequence will be:
\[ \text{sequence}[i] = d \times (i + 1) + i \]

Since \( d = n // \text{min\_sum} \) and \( \text{min\_sum} = k \times (k + 1) // 2 \), we get:
\[ d = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k \times (k + 1) // 2} \right\rfloor \]
\[ \text{sequence}[i] = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k \times (k + 1) // 2} \right\rfloor \times (i + 1) + i \]

Finally, the remainder will be 0 after \( k \) iterations.

### Final Output State

Output State: **sequence[i] = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k \times (k + 1) // 2} \right\rfloor \times (i + 1) + i, remainder = 0, k is a positive integer.**
