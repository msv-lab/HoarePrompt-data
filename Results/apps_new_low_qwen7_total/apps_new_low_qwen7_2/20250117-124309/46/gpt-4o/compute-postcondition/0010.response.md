Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `sequence[k-1]` is `initial_value + 1`
- `remainder` is `initial_remainder - 1`
- `k` is a positive integer

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `i` starts from `k-1` and goes down to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
- For the loop to continue executing, `i` should be greater than or equal to `-1`.

### Current State Before the Next Iteration:
- Since the loop runs in reverse order, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have decreased by 1 from its previous value. If `i` was `k-2` before the last iteration, then after the last iteration, `i` would be `k-3`.

### Adjusting the States:
- `i` decreases by 1 each iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i >= -1`.
- Therefore, if `i` was `k-2` before the last iteration, it will now be `k-3`.
- Since `k` is a positive integer, `k-1` is also a positive integer, and thus `k-3` will still be a valid index for the list.

### Updated States:
- `sequence[k-1]` remains unchanged as no modification happens inside the loop body.
- `remainder` remains unchanged as no modification happens inside the loop body.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not being modified in the loop head.

### Final Answer:
State: **`sequence[k-1]` is `initial_value + 1`, `remainder` is `initial_remainder - 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `k-3`**
