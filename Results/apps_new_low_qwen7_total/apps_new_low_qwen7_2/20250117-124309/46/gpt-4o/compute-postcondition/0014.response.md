Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `sequence[k-3]` is `initial_value + 2`
- `remainder` is `initial_remainder - 2`
- `k` is a positive integer
- `i` is `k-3`

### For Loop
```python
for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop runs from `k-1` down to `-1` (inclusive).
- In each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k-3`.

### Next Iteration
- Since `i` is currently `k-3`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
- In the next iteration, `i` will be `k-4`.

### Adjusting States
- The variable `i` will be updated to `k-4`.
- The loop will continue if `i` is still greater than or equal to `-1`.

### Updated State
- `sequence[k-3]` remains `initial_value + 2`
- `remainder` remains `initial_remainder - 2`
- `k` remains a positive integer
- `i` becomes `k-4`

### Final Answer
State: **`sequence[k-3]` is `initial_value + 2`, `remainder` is `initial_remainder - 2`, `k` is a positive integer, and `i` is `k-4`**
