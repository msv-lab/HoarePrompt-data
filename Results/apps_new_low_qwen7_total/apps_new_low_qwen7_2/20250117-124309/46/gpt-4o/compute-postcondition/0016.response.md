Postcondition: ***`sequence[k-3]` is `initial_value + 2`, `remainder` is `initial_remainder - 2`, `k` is a positive integer, and `i` is `k-4`. If `remainder` equals 0, no changes are made to the variables. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same regardless of the if condition.***
