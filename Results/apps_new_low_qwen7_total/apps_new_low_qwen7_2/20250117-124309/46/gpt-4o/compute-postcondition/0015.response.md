The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Given that there is no loop or conditional block in the provided code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sequence[k-3]` is `initial_value + 2`, `remainder` is `initial_remainder - 2`, `k` is a positive integer, and `i` is `k-4`.**
