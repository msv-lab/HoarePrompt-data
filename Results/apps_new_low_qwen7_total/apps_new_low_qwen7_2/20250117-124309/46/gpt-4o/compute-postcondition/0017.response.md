Initial State: `sequence[k-3]` is `initial_value + 2`, `remainder` is `initial_remainder - 2`, `k` is a positive integer, and `i` is `k-4`.

Code Block:
```
sequence[i] += 1
remainder -= 1
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `sequence[i] += 1` increments the value of `sequence[i]` by 1. Since `i` is `k-4`, this modifies `sequence[k-4]`.
2. The second line `remainder -= 1` decrements the value of `remainder` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `sequence[k-3]` is `initial_value + 2`
- `remainder` is `initial_remainder - 2`
- `k` is a positive integer
- `i` is `k-4`

After executing the code block:
- `sequence[k-4]` will be updated to `initial_value + 3` because it was initially `initial_value + 2` and then incremented by 1.
- `remainder` will be updated to `initial_remainder - 3` because it was initially `initial_remainder - 2` and then decremented by 1.

Since the precondition states that if `remainder` equals 0, no changes are made to the variables, we must consider that the decrement operation still occurs but the subsequent checks (if any) would need to be evaluated based on the new value of `remainder`.

Final Output State: **sequence[k-3] is initial_value + 2, sequence[k-4] is initial_value + 3, remainder is initial_remainder - 3, k is a positive integer, i is k-4**
