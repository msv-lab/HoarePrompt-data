The code calculates the minimum sum for `k` consecutive integers starting from 1, which is given by the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This value is assigned to the variable `min_sum`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is k * (k + 1) // 2**
