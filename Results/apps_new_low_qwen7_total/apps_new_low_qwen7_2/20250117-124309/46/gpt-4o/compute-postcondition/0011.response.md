The code `break` does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement specified in the given code, it simply ends the current context.

Output State: **`sequence[k-1]` is `initial_value + 1`, `remainder` is `initial_remainder - 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `k-3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
