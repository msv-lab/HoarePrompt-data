Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus d * min_sum , k is a positive integer, min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2, d is n // min_sum, remainder is n - d * min_sum, sequence is a list of k elements where each element is d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates `d` as the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`. This means `d` is the quotient when `n` is divided by `min_sum`.
- The second line calculates the remainder as `n` minus `d` times `min_sum`. This remainder is what's left over after `d` complete `min_sum` segments are taken from `n`.
- The third line creates a list called `sequence` with `k` elements. Each element is calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`. This creates a sequence starting from `d`, incrementing by `d` each time, up to `k` elements.
