Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `k-1` to `0` (inclusive).
   - Therefore, the loop head involves the variables `i`, `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[k-1, 0]`.
   - To ensure the loop starts, `i` must be `k-1` at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Consider the Given States:**
   - `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus `d * min_sum`.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
   - `d` is `n // min_sum`.
   - `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`.
   - `sequence` is a list of `k` elements where each element is `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in `range(k)`.

4. **State Required for the First Execution:**
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be `k-1`.

Therefore, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` is a positive integer**
