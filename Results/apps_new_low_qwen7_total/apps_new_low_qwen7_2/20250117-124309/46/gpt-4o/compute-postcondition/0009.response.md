Initial State: `i` is `k-1`, `k` is a positive integer. 

Code Block:
```
sequence[i] += 1
remainder -= 1
```

Analysis:
- The first line increments the value of `sequence[i]` by 1. Since `i` is `k-1`, we know that `sequence[k-1]` is being incremented by 1. We don't have the initial value of `sequence[k-1]`, so let's denote it as `initial_value`.
- The second line decreases `remainder` by 1. Again, since we don't have the initial value of `remainder`, let's denote it as `initial_remainder`.

Final State Calculation:
- After the first line, `sequence[k-1]` becomes `initial_value + 1`.
- After the second line, `remainder` becomes `initial_remainder - 1`.

Since the initial values of `sequence[k-1]` and `remainder` were not provided, we can express the final state in terms of these initial values.

Output State: **sequence[k-1] is initial_value + 1, remainder is initial_remainder - 1, k is a positive integer**
