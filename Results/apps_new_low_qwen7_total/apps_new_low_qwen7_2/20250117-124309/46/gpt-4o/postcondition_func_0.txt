The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, both within the range \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). It first calculates the minimum sum `min_sum` using the formula \(k \times (k + 1) // 2\). If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the quotient `d` of `n` divided by `min_sum` and the remainder `remainder` of `n` when divided by `min_sum`.

Next, it initializes a list `sequence` where each element is initially set to `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`. It then iteratively increments elements of `sequence` from the last to the first, reducing `remainder` by 1 until `remainder` becomes 0. After the loop, the function returns the list `sequence` where each element `sequence[i]` is calculated as `floor(n / (k * (k + 1) // 2)) * (i + 1) + i` and the remainder is guaranteed to be 0.

The function can return either -1 or a list `sequence` based on the specified conditions, ensuring that the returned list meets the required constraints.
