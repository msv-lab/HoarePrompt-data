### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum is `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized. If no such sequence exists, we output `-1`.

2. **Initial Assessment Analysis**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the main steps of the program:
     - Reading `n` and `k` from the input.
     - Calling the function `func_1(n, k)` to compute the sequence.
     - Handling the case where `min_sum > n` by returning `-1`.
     - Distributing the value `d` (initially `n // min_sum`) across the sequence and adjusting the last few elements to account for the remainder.
   - The original assessment also notes that the program ensures the sequence is strictly increasing and checks for the feasibility of forming such a sequence.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates `min_sum` and returns `-1` if `min_sum` is greater than `n`.
   - It then calculates `d` as the integer division of `n` by `min_sum` and initializes the sequence.
   - The for loop iteratively increases the last few elements to account for the remainder, ensuring the sequence remains strictly increasing and the total sum equals `n`.

4. **Detailed Validation**:
   - **Base Case Check**: The check `min_sum > n` ensures that if the smallest possible sum of `k` integers is already greater than `n`, it's impossible to form the sequence, and `-1` is correctly returned.
   - **GCD Maximization**: By initializing the sequence with `d * (i + 1)` and then incrementing the last few elements, the program ensures that the GCD of the sequence is maximized.
   - **Strictly Increasing Sequence**: The sequence is constructed in a way that ensures it remains strictly increasing, even after adjustments for the remainder.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the program correctly outputs `-1` since the smallest possible sum of three distinct positive integers is 6.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 3`, the program correctly outputs `[1, 2, 3]` as the sequence.
   - For `n = 8` and `k = 2`, the program correctly outputs `[2, 6]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence or return `-1` if no such sequence exists. The provided annotations and the step-by-step validation confirm that the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
