You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1

- Program: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if min_sum > n:
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence



- Annotated Code: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is k * (k + 1) // 2, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to n
    d = n // min_sum

remainder = n - d * min_sum

sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: sequence[i] = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k \times (k + 1) // 2} \right\rfloor \times (i + 1) + i, remainder = 0, k is a positive integer.
    return sequence
    #`The program returns the list sequence where each element sequence[i] is calculated as floor(n / (k * (k + 1) // 2)) * (i + 1) + i, and remainder is 0`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is smaller than the minimum possible sum of `k` strictly increasing positive integers. Specifically, the smallest possible sum of `k` strictly increasing positive integers is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `n` is less than this value, the program should return `-1`, but the current implementation only checks if `min_sum > n` without considering the possibility that `n` might be just slightly less than `min_sum`.

To fix this, the program should also check if `n` is exactly equal to `min_sum` and handle this case separately. Here is a corrected version:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if n < min_sum:
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence

# Additional check to ensure the GCD of the sequence is maximized
def check_gcd(sequence):
    return reduce(gcd, sequence)

result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(result)
else:
    if check_gcd(result) > 1:
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles the case where `n` is exactly equal to the minimum sum, ensuring that the sequence generated has a maximal GCD.
