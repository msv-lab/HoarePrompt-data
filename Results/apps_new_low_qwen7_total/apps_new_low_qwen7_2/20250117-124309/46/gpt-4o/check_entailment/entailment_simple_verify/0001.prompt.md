You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1

- Program: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if min_sum > n:
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence



- Annotated Code: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is k * (k + 1) // 2, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to n
    d = n // min_sum

remainder = n - d * min_sum

sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: sequence[i] = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k \times (k + 1) // 2} \right\rfloor \times (i + 1) + i, remainder = 0, k is a positive integer.
    return sequence
    #`The program returns the list sequence where each element sequence[i] is calculated as floor(n / (k * (k + 1) // 2)) * (i + 1) + i, and remainder is 0`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The given program aims to generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized.
2. The program starts by reading `n` and `k` from the input.
3. It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to compute the sequence.
4. In `func_1`:
   - It calculates the minimum sum (`min_sum`) of the smallest `k` strictly increasing positive integers using the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers.
   - If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to form such a sequence.
   - It computes the initial GCD candidate (`d`) as `n // min_sum`.
   - It calculates the remainder needed to reach `n` after distributing `d` evenly among the `k` elements.
   - It initializes the sequence with each element being `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in range `k`.
   - It adjusts the last few elements to account for the remainder while maintaining the sequence's order and ensuring the sum remains `n`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly handles the cases where the sequence can be formed and where it cannot. It ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing and checks for the condition where the sequence can't be formed.
