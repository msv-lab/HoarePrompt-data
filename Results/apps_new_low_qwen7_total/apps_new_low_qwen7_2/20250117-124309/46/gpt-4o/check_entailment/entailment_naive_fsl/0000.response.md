Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is smaller than the minimum possible sum of `k` strictly increasing positive integers. Specifically, the smallest possible sum of `k` strictly increasing positive integers is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `n` is less than this value, the program should return `-1`, but the current implementation only checks if `min_sum > n` without considering the possibility that `n` might be just slightly less than `min_sum`.

To fix this, the program should also check if `n` is exactly equal to `min_sum` and handle this case separately. Here is a corrected version:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if n < min_sum:
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence

# Additional check to ensure the GCD of the sequence is maximized
def check_gcd(sequence):
    return reduce(gcd, sequence)

result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(result)
else:
    if check_gcd(result) > 1:
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles the case where `n` is exactly equal to the minimum sum, ensuring that the sequence generated has a maximal GCD.
