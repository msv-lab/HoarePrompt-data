You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1

- Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if min_sum > n:
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, both within the range \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). It first calculates the minimum sum `min_sum` using the formula \(k \times (k + 1) // 2\). If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the quotient `d` of `n` divided by `min_sum` and the remainder `remainder` of `n` when divided by `min_sum`.

Next, it initializes a list `sequence` where each element is initially set to `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`. It then iteratively increments elements of `sequence` from the last to the first, reducing `remainder` by 1 until `remainder` becomes 0. After the loop, the function returns the list `sequence` where each element `sequence[i]` is calculated as `floor(n / (k * (k + 1) // 2)) * (i + 1) + i` and the remainder is guaranteed to be 0.

The function can return either -1 or a list `sequence` based on the specified conditions, ensuring that the returned list meets the required constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is smaller than the minimum possible sum of `k` strictly increasing positive integers. Specifically, the smallest possible sum of `k` strictly increasing positive integers is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `n` is less than this value, the program should return `-1`, but the current implementation only checks if `min_sum > n` without considering the possibility that `n` might be just slightly less than `min_sum`.

To fix this, the program should also check if `n` is exactly equal to `min_sum` and handle this case separately. Here is a corrected version:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if n < min_sum:
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence

# Additional check to ensure the GCD of the sequence is maximized
def check_gcd(sequence):
    return reduce(gcd, sequence)

result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(result)
else:
    if check_gcd(result) > 1:
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles the case where `n` is exactly equal to the minimum sum, ensuring that the sequence generated has a maximal GCD.
