### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description and Functionality:**
   - We need to generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and have a maximal greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - If no such sequence exists, we return `-1`.

2. **Initial Assessment:**
   - The initial assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the case where `n` is exactly equal to the minimum sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`). This oversight means the program would incorrectly return a sequence instead of `-1` in certain cases.

3. **Function Summaries:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum sum and checks if `n` is at least as large. It then divides `n` by this minimum sum to find `d` and handles the remainder appropriately to construct the sequence.

4. **Original Code Analysis:**
   - The program correctly checks if `min_sum > n` and returns `-1` in that case.
   - However, the original assessment suggests adding an additional check for `n == min_sum` to ensure the GCD is maximized. This is unnecessary because the current logic already ensures that the sequence constructed will have the maximum possible GCD.

5. **Corrected Version Analysis:**
   - The proposed correction includes an additional check to ensure the GCD of the sequence is maximized. While this is a good practice, it is not strictly necessary based on the problem constraints. The sequence constructed will naturally have the maximum possible GCD due to the way `d` and `remainder` are handled.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is exactly equal to the minimum sum.
   - The proposed corrections add unnecessary complexity and do not change the fundamental correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: True**

The original program is correct according to the problem statement and the function summaries provided. The proposed corrections are not necessary and do not improve the correctness of the program.
