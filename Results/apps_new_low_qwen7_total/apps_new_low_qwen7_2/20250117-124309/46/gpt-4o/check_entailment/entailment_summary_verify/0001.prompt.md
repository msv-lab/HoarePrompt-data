You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1

- Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if min_sum > n:
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, both within the range \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). It first calculates the minimum sum `min_sum` using the formula \(k \times (k + 1) // 2\). If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the quotient `d` of `n` divided by `min_sum` and the remainder `remainder` of `n` when divided by `min_sum`.

Next, it initializes a list `sequence` where each element is initially set to `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`. It then iteratively increments elements of `sequence` from the last to the first, reducing `remainder` by 1 until `remainder` becomes 0. After the loop, the function returns the list `sequence` where each element `sequence[i]` is calculated as `floor(n / (k * (k + 1) // 2)) * (i + 1) + i` and the remainder is guaranteed to be 0.

The function can return either -1 or a list `sequence` based on the specified conditions, ensuring that the returned list meets the required constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The given program aims to generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized.
2. The program starts by reading `n` and `k` from the input.
3. It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to compute the sequence.
4. In `func_1`:
   - It calculates the minimum sum (`min_sum`) of the smallest `k` strictly increasing positive integers using the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers.
   - If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to form such a sequence.
   - It computes the initial GCD candidate (`d`) as `n // min_sum`.
   - It calculates the remainder needed to reach `n` after distributing `d` evenly among the `k` elements.
   - It initializes the sequence with each element being `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in range `k`.
   - It adjusts the last few elements to account for the remainder while maintaining the sequence's order and ensuring the sum remains `n`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly handles the cases where the sequence can be formed and where it cannot. It ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing and checks for the condition where the sequence can't be formed.
