### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n` and have a maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - If no such sequence exists, we return `-1`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function first calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers using the formula \( \text{min\_sum} = k \times (k + 1) // 2 \).
   - If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns `-1`, indicating no valid sequence can be formed.
   - Next, it calculates the initial GCD candidate `d` as `n // min_sum`.
   - It then calculates the remainder needed to reach `n` after distributing `d` evenly among the `k` elements.
   - The function initializes the sequence with each element being `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in range `k`.
   - It adjusts the last few elements to account for the remainder while maintaining the sequence's order and ensuring the sum remains `n`.

3. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - **Case 1**: \( n < k \times (k + 1) // 2 \)
     - Here, `min_sum > n`, so the function returns `-1`. This is correct because no sequence of `k` strictly increasing positive integers can sum up to `n` in this case.
   - **Case 2**: \( n = k \times (k + 1) // 2 \)
     - The sequence can be exactly the first `k` natural numbers, which is the simplest valid sequence. The GCD will be `1`, which is maximal for this case.
   - **Case 3**: \( n > k \times (k + 1) // 2 \)
     - The function calculates `d` as `n // min_sum`. For example, if `d = 1`, the sequence would be `[1, 2, 3, ...]`, but we need to adjust to fit the exact sum `n`.
     - The function ensures that the adjusted sequence maintains the GCD as large as possible by incrementing the last elements to account for the remainder.

4. **Original Assessment Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and flow of the program.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing and the sum is `n`.
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where no valid sequence can be formed.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the sequence and handle all edge cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
