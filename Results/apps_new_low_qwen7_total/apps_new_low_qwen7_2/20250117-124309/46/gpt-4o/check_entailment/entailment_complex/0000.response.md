Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `n` and `k` from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Function Call and Output**: The program calls the function `func_1(n, k)` and prints the appropriate output based on the return value of the function.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - **Initial Check**: The function checks if the minimum sum `min_sum` (which is \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \)) is greater than `n`. If it is, it returns `-1` immediately. This ensures that the function only proceeds if a valid sequence can exist.
   - **GCD Calculation**: The function calculates the greatest common divisor `d` of `n` and `min_sum` by taking `n // min_sum`.
   - **Sequence Initialization**: It initializes the sequence with values `d * (i + 1)` for each index `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
   - **Adjustment for Remainder**: It then iterates backward through the sequence, incrementing elements by 1 until the `remainder` is zero. This step ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `n` while maintaining the strictly increasing order.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the constructed sequence or `-1` if the sequence cannot be formed.

Given that the logic follows the requirements of the problem and handles all edge cases appropriately (such as when `min_sum` is greater than `n`), the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
