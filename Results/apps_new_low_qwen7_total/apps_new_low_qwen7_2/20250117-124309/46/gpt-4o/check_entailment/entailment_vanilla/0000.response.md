Reasoning:

1. The given program aims to generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized.
2. The program starts by reading `n` and `k` from the input.
3. It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to compute the sequence.
4. In `func_1`:
   - It calculates the minimum sum (`min_sum`) of the smallest `k` strictly increasing positive integers using the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers.
   - If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to form such a sequence.
   - It computes the initial GCD candidate (`d`) as `n // min_sum`.
   - It calculates the remainder needed to reach `n` after distributing `d` evenly among the `k` elements.
   - It initializes the sequence with each element being `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in range `k`.
   - It adjusts the last few elements to account for the remainder while maintaining the sequence's order and ensuring the sum remains `n`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly handles the cases where the sequence can be formed and where it cannot. It ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing and checks for the condition where the sequence can't be formed.

Correctness: **True**
