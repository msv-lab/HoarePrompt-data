Reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading the inputs \( n \) and \( k \) from the user.
2. It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to determine if a valid sequence can be formed.
3. The function `func_1(n, k)` first checks if the minimum possible sum of \( k \) positive integers (which is \( \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \)) can fit within \( n \). If not, it returns `-1`.
4. If the minimum sum fits, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) candidate as \( \frac{n}{\text{min\_sum}} \).
5. It then calculates the initial sequence based on this GCD candidate.
6. Finally, it adjusts the elements of the sequence to ensure they sum up exactly to \( n \).

The logic for calculating the GCD candidate and adjusting the sequence appears to be correct. Here's why:

- The minimum sum check ensures that if even the smallest possible sum of \( k \) integers is greater than \( n \), there is no solution.
- The GCD candidate \( d = \frac{n}{\text{min\_sum}} \) is a reasonable guess for the greatest common divisor because it evenly distributes the total sum among the \( k \) terms.
- Adjusting the sequence by distributing the remainder ensures that the final sequence sums to \( n \) and maintains the strictly increasing property.

Given that the logic seems sound and the program correctly handles all edge cases (such as returning `-1` when no valid sequence exists), the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
