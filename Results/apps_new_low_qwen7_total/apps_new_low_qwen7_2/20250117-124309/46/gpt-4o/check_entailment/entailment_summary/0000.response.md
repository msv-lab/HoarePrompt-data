Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies if the minimal sum of a strictly increasing sequence of length `k` can exceed `n`.
2. It calculates the base value `d` which is the quotient of `n` divided by the minimum sum `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This ensures the initial values of the sequence are at least as large as they need to be.
3. The program then adjusts these initial values by incrementally adding to the last elements until the total sum equals `n`. This adjustment process ensures the greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized while maintaining the strictly increasing property.
4. The logic for distributing the remainder among the sequence elements is sound, as it starts from the largest elements and works backward, ensuring the sequence remains strictly increasing.

Given this analysis, the program appears to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and computes the correct sequence when possible.

Correctness: **True**
