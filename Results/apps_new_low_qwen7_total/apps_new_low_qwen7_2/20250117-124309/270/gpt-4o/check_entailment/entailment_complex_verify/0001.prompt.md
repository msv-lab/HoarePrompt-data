You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nothing is eternal in the world, Kostya understood it on the 7-th of January when he saw partially dead four-color garland.

Now he has a goal to replace dead light bulbs, however he doesn't know how many light bulbs for each color are required. It is guaranteed that for each of four colors at least one light is working.

It is known that the garland contains light bulbs of four colors: red, blue, yellow and green. The garland is made as follows: if you take any four consecutive light bulbs then there will not be light bulbs with the same color among them. For example, the garland can look like "RYBGRYBGRY", "YBGRYBGRYBG", "BGRYB", but can not look like "BGRYG", "YBGRYBYGR" or "BGYBGY". Letters denote colors: 'R' — red, 'B' — blue, 'Y' — yellow, 'G' — green.

Using the information that for each color at least one light bulb still works count the number of dead light bulbs of each four colors.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains the string s (4 ≤ |s| ≤ 100), which describes the garland, the i-th symbol of which describes the color of the i-th light bulb in the order from the beginning of garland:   'R' — the light bulb is red,  'B' — the light bulb is blue,  'Y' — the light bulb is yellow,  'G' — the light bulb is green,  '!' — the light bulb is dead. 

The string s can not contain other symbols except those five which were described. 

It is guaranteed that in the given string at least once there is each of four letters 'R', 'B', 'Y' and 'G'. 

It is guaranteed that the string s is correct garland with some blown light bulbs, it means that for example the line "GRBY!!!B" can not be in the input data. 


-----Output-----

In the only line print four integers k_{r}, k_{b}, k_{y}, k_{g} — the number of dead light bulbs of red, blue, yellow and green colors accordingly.


-----Examples-----
Input
RYBGRYBGR

Output
0 0 0 0
Input
!RGYB

Output
0 1 0 0
Input
!!!!YGRB

Output
1 1 1 1
Input
!GB!RG!Y!

Output
2 1 1 0


-----Note-----

In the first example there are no dead light bulbs.

In the second example it is obvious that one blue bulb is blown, because it could not be light bulbs of other colors on its place according to the statements.

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input().strip()
    dead_bulbs = {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}
    positions = {}
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char in 'RBYG':
            positions[char] = i % 4
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '!':
            for (color, pos) in positions.items():
                if i % 4 == pos:
                    dead_bulbs[color] += 1
    print(dead_bulbs['R'], dead_bulbs['B'], dead_bulbs['Y'], dead_bulbs['G'])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string s is a non-empty string of length between 4 and 100, inclusive, consisting of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', where '!' denotes a dead light bulb. The string s guarantees that each of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' appears at least once, and s represents a valid garland as defined in the problem description.
def func():
    s = input().strip()

dead_bulbs = {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}

positions = {}
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char in 'RBYG':
            positions[char] = i % 4
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `dead_bulbs` remains unchanged as {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}, and `positions` is updated such that for each character `char` in 'RBYG' found in `s`, its position in `s` (considering zero-based indexing) modulo 4 is stored in `positions[char]`. If a character is not in 'RBYG', no changes occur in `positions`. The loop will execute until all characters in `s` have been processed.
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '!':
            for color, pos in positions.items():
                if i % 4 == pos:
                    dead_bulbs[color] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the total number of iterations, `char` is the last character of `s`, `positions` is an empty dictionary, and `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary containing the count of times `i % 4` matched the position of each color, with all counts updated based on the loop's execution. The loop will execute until all characters in `s` have been processed. If `char` is '!', the condition `i % 4 == pos` is checked for each color in `positions`, and if true, `dead_bulbs[color]` is incremented. If `char` is not '!', no changes are made to `positions` and `dead_bulbs`.
    #
    #The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in `s` to process. Once all characters in `s` have been processed, the loop terminates, and the final state of `positions` will be an empty dictionary since the loop updates it only once per character and clears it upon completion. The final state of `dead_bulbs` will reflect the counts of occurrences where `i % 4` matched the position of each color.
    print(dead_bulbs['R'], dead_bulbs['B'], dead_bulbs['Y'], dead_bulbs['G'])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` takes a string `s` as input, which is a non-empty garland consisting of characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', where '!' denotes a dead light bulb. It calculates the count of '!' characters in `s` and prints the counts of '!' for each of the colors 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G'. Specifically, it iterates through the string `s`, identifies the positions of the colors 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' modulo 4, and increments the count of '!' for each color if the position of '!' matches one of these calculated positions. If no '!' is found, it simply prints 0 for each color.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first identifying the positions of the working light bulbs of each color ('R', 'B', 'Y', 'G') using their periodicity in the garland. Then, it counts the number of dead light bulbs (`'!'`) at those positions.

1. The program correctly initializes `dead_bulbs` as a dictionary to keep track of the number of dead light bulbs for each color.
2. It creates an empty dictionary `positions` to store the positions of the working light bulbs of each color.
3. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` and checks if it represents a working light bulb of a known color ('R', 'B', 'Y', 'G'). If so, it stores the index modulo 4 (to capture the periodic pattern of the garland) in the `positions` dictionary.
4. Another loop then iterates over each character in the string `s`. When a dead light bulb (`'!'`) is found, it checks if its position matches any of the stored positions in `positions`. If it does, it increments the corresponding count in `dead_bulbs`.
5. Finally, it prints the counts of dead bulbs for each color.

However, there are a few issues with the logic that need to be addressed:
- The `positions` dictionary should be initialized with all four colors since we know each color has at least one working bulb.
- The program assumes that the initial positions of the working bulbs are correct without checking for the garland's constraints (no four consecutive identical colors). This might lead to incorrect positions being stored in the `positions` dictionary.
- After fixing the initialization of `positions`, the counting logic should be more robust to ensure it handles all cases correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    s = input().strip()
    dead_bulbs = {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}
    positions = {'R': -1, 'B': -1, 'Y': -1, 'G': -1}
    
    # Identify the initial positions of the working light bulbs
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in 'RBYG':
            positions[char] = i
    
    # Ensure the positions form a valid garland
    while any(positions.values()) != -1 and len(set(s[i: i+4] for i in range(0, len(s), 4))) < 4:
        for color, pos in positions.items():
            if pos != -1:
                positions[color] = (positions[color] + 1) % len(s)
    
    # Count the number of dead light bulbs at the identified positions
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char == '!':
            for color, pos in positions.items():
                if pos == i % len(s):
                    dead_bulbs[color] += 1
    
    print(dead_bulbs['R'], dead_bulbs['B'], dead_bulbs['Y'], dead_bulbs['G'])

```

Given these corrections, the program should now work correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem statement.
