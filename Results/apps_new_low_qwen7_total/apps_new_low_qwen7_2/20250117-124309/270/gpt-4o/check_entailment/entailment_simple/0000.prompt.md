Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nothing is eternal in the world, Kostya understood it on the 7-th of January when he saw partially dead four-color garland.

Now he has a goal to replace dead light bulbs, however he doesn't know how many light bulbs for each color are required. It is guaranteed that for each of four colors at least one light is working.

It is known that the garland contains light bulbs of four colors: red, blue, yellow and green. The garland is made as follows: if you take any four consecutive light bulbs then there will not be light bulbs with the same color among them. For example, the garland can look like "RYBGRYBGRY", "YBGRYBGRYBG", "BGRYB", but can not look like "BGRYG", "YBGRYBYGR" or "BGYBGY". Letters denote colors: 'R' — red, 'B' — blue, 'Y' — yellow, 'G' — green.

Using the information that for each color at least one light bulb still works count the number of dead light bulbs of each four colors.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains the string s (4 ≤ |s| ≤ 100), which describes the garland, the i-th symbol of which describes the color of the i-th light bulb in the order from the beginning of garland:   'R' — the light bulb is red,  'B' — the light bulb is blue,  'Y' — the light bulb is yellow,  'G' — the light bulb is green,  '!' — the light bulb is dead. 

The string s can not contain other symbols except those five which were described. 

It is guaranteed that in the given string at least once there is each of four letters 'R', 'B', 'Y' and 'G'. 

It is guaranteed that the string s is correct garland with some blown light bulbs, it means that for example the line "GRBY!!!B" can not be in the input data. 


-----Output-----

In the only line print four integers k_{r}, k_{b}, k_{y}, k_{g} — the number of dead light bulbs of red, blue, yellow and green colors accordingly.


-----Examples-----
Input
RYBGRYBGR

Output
0 0 0 0
Input
!RGYB

Output
0 1 0 0
Input
!!!!YGRB

Output
1 1 1 1
Input
!GB!RG!Y!

Output
2 1 1 0


-----Note-----

In the first example there are no dead light bulbs.

In the second example it is obvious that one blue bulb is blown, because it could not be light bulbs of other colors on its place according to the statements.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string s is a non-empty string of length between 4 and 100, inclusive, consisting of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', where '!' denotes a dead light bulb. The string s guarantees that each of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' appears at least once, and s represents a valid garland as defined in the problem description.
def func():
    s = input().strip()

dead_bulbs = {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}

positions = {}
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char in 'RBYG':
            positions[char] = i % 4
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `dead_bulbs` remains unchanged as {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}, and `positions` is updated such that for each character `char` in 'RBYG' found in `s`, its position in `s` (considering zero-based indexing) modulo 4 is stored in `positions[char]`. If a character is not in 'RBYG', no changes occur in `positions`. The loop will execute until all characters in `s` have been processed.
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '!':
            for color, pos in positions.items():
                if i % 4 == pos:
                    dead_bulbs[color] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the total number of iterations, `char` is the last character of `s`, `positions` is an empty dictionary, and `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary containing the count of times `i % 4` matched the position of each color, with all counts updated based on the loop's execution. The loop will execute until all characters in `s` have been processed. If `char` is '!', the condition `i % 4 == pos` is checked for each color in `positions`, and if true, `dead_bulbs[color]` is incremented. If `char` is not '!', no changes are made to `positions` and `dead_bulbs`.
    #
    #The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in `s` to process. Once all characters in `s` have been processed, the loop terminates, and the final state of `positions` will be an empty dictionary since the loop updates it only once per character and clears it upon completion. The final state of `dead_bulbs` will reflect the counts of occurrences where `i % 4` matched the position of each color.
    print(dead_bulbs['R'], dead_bulbs['B'], dead_bulbs['Y'], dead_bulbs['G'])
