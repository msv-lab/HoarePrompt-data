The function `func()` takes a string `s` as input, which is a non-empty garland consisting of characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', where '!' denotes a dead light bulb. It calculates the count of '!' characters in `s` and prints the counts of '!' for each of the colors 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G'. Specifically, it iterates through the string `s`, identifies the positions of the colors 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' modulo 4, and increments the count of '!' for each color if the position of '!' matches one of these calculated positions. If no '!' is found, it simply prints 0 for each color.
