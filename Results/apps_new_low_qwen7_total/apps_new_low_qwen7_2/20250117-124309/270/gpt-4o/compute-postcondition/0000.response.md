The given code initializes two dictionaries: `dead_bulbs` and `positions`. It also reads an input string `s` which is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. However, the code does not perform any operations on these variables or modify their values in any way. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **s is a non-empty string of length between 4 and 100, consisting of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', where '!' denotes a dead light bulb. Each of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' appears at least once. dead_bulbs is {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}, positions is {}**
