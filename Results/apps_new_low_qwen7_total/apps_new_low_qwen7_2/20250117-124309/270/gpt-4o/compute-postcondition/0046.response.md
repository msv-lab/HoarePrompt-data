Postcondition: ***`total` is the total number of iterations plus two, `i` is the total number of iterations plus two, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `positions` must have at least one key-value pair. If `i % 4 == pos`, then `dead_bulbs[color]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
