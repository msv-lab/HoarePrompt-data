Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented by 1, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `positions` is a non-empty dictionary with at least one item left. If `i % 4 == pos`, then `color` is the first key in the remaining items of `positions`, `pos` is the corresponding value, and `dead_bulbs[color]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
