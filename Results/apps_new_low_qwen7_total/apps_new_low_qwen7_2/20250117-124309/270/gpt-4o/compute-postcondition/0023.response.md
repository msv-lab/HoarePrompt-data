Postcondition: ***`positions` must have at least two items, `color` is the third key in the `positions` dictionary, `pos` is the corresponding value to the third key. If `i % 4 == pos`, then `dead_bulbs[color]` is the initial value plus 2. Otherwise, `dead_bulbs[color]` is the initial value plus 1.***
