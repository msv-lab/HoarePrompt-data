Postcondition: ***`positions` must have at least two items; `color` is the second key in the `positions` dictionary; `pos` is the corresponding value to the second key; if `i % 4 == pos`, then `dead_bulbs[color]` is the initial value plus 1. Otherwise, the state of `dead_bulbs[color]` remains unchanged.***
