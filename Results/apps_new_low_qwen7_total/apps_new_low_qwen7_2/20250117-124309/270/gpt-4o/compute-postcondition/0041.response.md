Postcondition: **`total` is the total number of iterations plus two, `i` is the total number of iterations plus two, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `positions` must have at least one key-value pair, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary containing the count of times `i % 4` matched the position of each color, and currently `i % 4 == pos`.**
