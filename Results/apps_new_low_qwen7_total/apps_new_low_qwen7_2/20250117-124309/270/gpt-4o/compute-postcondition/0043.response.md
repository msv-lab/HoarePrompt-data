Postcondition: ***`total` is the total number of iterations plus two, `i` is the total number of iterations plus two, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `positions` must have at least one key-value pair, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary containing the count of times `i % 4` matched the position of each color with the count incremented by 1 for the key `color`. This holds true regardless of whether `i % 4 == pos` is true or false, as the else part is not contributing any additional changes to the variables.***
