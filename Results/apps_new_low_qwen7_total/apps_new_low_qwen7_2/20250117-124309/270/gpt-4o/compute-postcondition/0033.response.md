Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented by 1, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `positions` is a non-empty dictionary with one less item, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary containing the count of times `i % 4` matched the position of each color. If `i % 4 == pos`, then the count for `color` in `dead_bulbs` is increased by 1.***
