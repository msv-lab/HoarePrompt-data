Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented by 1, `char` is the first character of `s`, `positions` is a dictionary, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary containing the count of times `i % 4` matched the position of each color. If `char` is '!', then `i` is the total number of iterations and `dead_bulbs` is updated according to the position of each color. If `char` is not '!', no changes are made to `positions` and `dead_bulbs`.**
