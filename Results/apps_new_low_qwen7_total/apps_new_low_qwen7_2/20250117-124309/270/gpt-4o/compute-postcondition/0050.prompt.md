Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the total number of iterations plus two, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `positions` is an empty dictionary, and `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary containing the count of times `i % 4` matched the position of each color, with all counts updated based on the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
for color, pos in positions.items():
    if i % 4 == pos:
        dead_bulbs[color] += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`total` is the total number of iterations plus two, `i` is the total number of iterations plus two, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `positions` must have at least one key-value pair, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary containing the count of times `i % 4` matched the position of each color with the count incremented by 1 for the key `color`. This holds true regardless of whether `i % 4 == pos` is true or false, as the else part is not contributing any additional changes to the variables.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`total` is the total number of iterations plus two, `i` is the total number of iterations plus two, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `positions` must have at least one key-value pair. If `i % 4 == pos`, then `dead_bulbs[color]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`total` is the total number of iterations plus two, `i` is the total number of iterations plus two, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `positions` must have at least one key-value pair, and `dead_bulbs[color]` is incremented by 1 if `i % 4 == pos`. Otherwise, the values of `total`, `i`, `char`, `positions`, and `dead_bulbs` remain unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
