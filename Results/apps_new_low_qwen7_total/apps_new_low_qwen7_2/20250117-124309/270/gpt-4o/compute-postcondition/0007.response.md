Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `dead_bulbs` remains unchanged as {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}, `positions` is updated such that if `char` is in 'RBYG', then `positions[char]` is set to `(i + 1) % 4`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1, and `char` is the next character in the string `s`.***
