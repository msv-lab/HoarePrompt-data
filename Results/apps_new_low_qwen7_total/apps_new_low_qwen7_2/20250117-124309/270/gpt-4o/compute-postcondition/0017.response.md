Postcondition: ***`positions` must have at least one item, `color` is the first key in the `positions` dictionary, `pos` is the corresponding value to the first key. If `i % 4` equals the current value of `pos`, `dead_bulbs[color]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
