Postcondition: ***`total` is the total number of iterations plus two, `i` is the total number of iterations plus two, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `positions` must have at least one key-value pair, and `dead_bulbs[color]` is incremented by 1 if `i % 4 == pos`. Otherwise, the values of `total`, `i`, `char`, `positions`, and `dead_bulbs` remain unchanged.***
