Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the total number of iterations plus two, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `positions` contains zero or more key-value pairs where each key is a color and each value is a position such that `i % 4 == pos` for at least one pair, and `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary containing the count of times `i % 4` matched the position of each color in `positions`. If `i % 4 == pos` for a given color, then `dead_bulbs[color]` will be incremented by the number of times this condition was met. The overall state of the program does not change regardless of whether `char == '!'` is true or false.***
