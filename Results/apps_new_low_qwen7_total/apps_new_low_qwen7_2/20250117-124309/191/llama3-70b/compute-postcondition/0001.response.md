The only variables involved in the loop head are `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `n`. The loop will iterate `n` times, but the initial value of `_` is not significant since it is not used within the loop.

For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be at least 1 because the `range(n)` function generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, if `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute at all.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `stars` is an empty list `[]`

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the input integer, `stars` is []**
