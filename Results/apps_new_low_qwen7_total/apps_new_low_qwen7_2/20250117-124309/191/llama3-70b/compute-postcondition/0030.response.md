Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `j` is `len(row) - 1`, `c` is the last character in the string `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_', `n` is `n - 1`, and `row` is a non-empty string. Additionally, the current value of `c` is '*', meaning the last character in the string `row` is a star ('*').***
