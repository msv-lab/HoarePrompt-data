Output State: **n is 0, m remains unchanged, stars is a list of tuples containing indices of '*' characters and their row numbers, c is undefined, j is -1, side is the maximum side length calculated from the stars' positions**

Explanation:
1. The first four lines of the code compute the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates from the `stars` list. These values are used to determine the bounding box that encloses all the '*' characters.
2. The fifth line calculates the side length of the square that can contain all the '*' characters. This is done by taking the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, and adding 1 to account for the inclusive nature of the range.
3. The sixth line prints the calculated side length.
4. After executing the code, the variables `n`, `m`, `stars`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variable `side` is added with the calculated value.

Since the exact content of the `stars` list is not provided, we cannot give a numerical value for `side`. However, based on the logic of the code, `side` will be the size of the smallest square that can enclose all the '*' characters from the `stars` list.
