`stars` is a list containing at least one tuple. The code appends a new tuple `(j, _)` to the `stars` list. The values of `j` and `_` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain as they are.

Output State: **`c` is equal to `next_char_next`, `stars` is a list containing at least one tuple and now includes the tuple `(j, _)`.**
