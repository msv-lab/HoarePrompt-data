Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `j` is `len(row) - 1`, `c` is the next character in the string `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_', and `n` is `n - 2`. If `c` is '*', `stars` now includes the tuple `(len(row) - 1, '_')`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
