The code snippet appends a new tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`. The value of `j` is added as the first element of the tuple, and `_` (which is likely a placeholder or a specific value) is added as the second element of the tuple. The values of `c`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Since the initial state does not specify what `_` is, we can denote it as a placeholder. The output state will include the updated `stars` list with the new tuple appended.

Output State: **`c` is '*', `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_', `n` is greater than 0, `m` remains unchanged, `stars` now includes an additional tuple `(j, _)`**
