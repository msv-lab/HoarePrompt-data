`j` is set to `len(row) - 2`, `c` is the second last character in the string `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_', `n` is `n - 1`, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `c` is '*', then `stars` includes the tuple `(len(row) - 1, '_')`. The code `stars.append((j, _))` appends a tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`. Here, `_` is the last known value before the code, which is the last element of the tuple in `stars`.

Since `j` is already defined as `len(row) - 2`, the tuple added to `stars` is `(len(row) - 2, _)`. The value of `_` is the last element in the list `stars` before the append operation.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `total` remains unspecified
- `j` is `len(row) - 2`
- `c` is the second last character in the string `row`
- `stars` is now a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_', plus the new tuple `(len(row) - 2, _)`
- `n` is `n - 1`
- `row` is a non-empty string

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `j` is `len(row) - 2`, `c` is the second last character in the string `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_', plus the new tuple `(len(row) - 2, _)`, `n` is `n - 1`, and `row` is a non-empty string.**
