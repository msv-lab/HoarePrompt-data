The given code snippet reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, which represent the dimensions of a 2D list, and initializes an empty list `stars` to store the star map. However, the code does not complete the initialization of the `stars` list by populating it with the appropriate number of rows and columns filled with '.' and '*'. Therefore, based on the provided code, we cannot fully determine the contents of the `stars` list.

Given the initial state and the provided code, the final output state will only include the updated values of `n` and `m`, and the partially initialized `stars` list as an empty list.

Output State: **n is the input integer, m is the input integer, stars is []**
