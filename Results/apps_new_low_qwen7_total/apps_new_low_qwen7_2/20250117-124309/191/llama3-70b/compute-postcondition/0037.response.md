`stars` is appended with a new tuple `(j, _)`. Given that `_` is the next character in the string `row`, and since `c` is the next character in the string `row`, `_` is equivalent to `c`. Also, `j` is `len(row) - 1`. Therefore, the tuple being added to `stars` is `(len(row) - 1, c)`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `j` is `len(row) - 1`, `c` is the next character in the string `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_', and `n` is `n - 2`; `stars` now includes the tuple `(len(row) - 1, c)`**
