Output State: **`n` is `0`, `m` remains unchanged, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in any of the input rows and its corresponding row number, `c` is undefined, and `j` is `-1`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
   - The loop iterates `n` times.
   - Each iteration processes a row of input.
   - For each character in the row, if it is '*', a tuple `(j, _)` is appended to `stars`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n`: Decrements by 1 after each full iteration of the outer loop.
   - `m`: Remains unchanged because it is not used inside the loop.
   - `stars`: Grows with each occurrence of '*' in the rows.
   - `c`: Becomes undefined after processing the entire row (last character processed).
   - `j`: Becomes `-1` after the inner loop finishes processing a row, indicating the end of the row.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues until `n` reaches `0`.
   - For each row, the loop checks each character. If the character is '*', it appends the index `j` and the current row number `_` to `stars`.
   - Once the loop has processed all `n` rows, `n` will be `0`, and `j` will be `-1`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The final state matches the description provided:
     - `n` is `0` because the loop stops when all rows have been processed.
     - `m` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
     - `stars` contains tuples of indices of '*' characters and their respective row numbers.
     - `c` is undefined after the last row is fully processed.
     - `j` is `-1` indicating the end of the last row.

Therefore, the output state after all executions of the loop have finished is: **`n` is `0`, `m` remains unchanged, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in any of the input rows and its corresponding row number, `c` is undefined, and `j` is `-1`.**
