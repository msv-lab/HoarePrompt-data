Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head does not directly contain any variables named `c`, `j`, or `stars`. However, it does contain `n`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the variables are as follows:
   - `c` is the last character in the string `row`.
   - `j` is `len(row) - 1`.
   - `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_'.
   - `m` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is a constant or variable defined outside the loop. The loop itself does not change these variables directly; instead, it iterates based on the value of `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the number of iterations remaining (`n`) must be decremented by 1.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the variable `n` (which is part of the loop head), but since the problem specifies we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head and the loop head here only contains `n`, and no other variables, the only thing we can adjust is `n` itself.

However, since `n` is not explicitly stated in the given example and we are only focusing on the variables in the loop head, we need to ensure that `n` is decremented by 1 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`c` is the last character in the string `row`, `j` is `len(row) - 1`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_', `n` is `n - 1`.**
