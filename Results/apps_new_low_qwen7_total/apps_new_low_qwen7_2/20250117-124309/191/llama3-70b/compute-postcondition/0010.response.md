The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `c`. Therefore, we can only adjust those two variables. The value of `c` is derived from the current character in the string `row` as indexed by `j`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `c` is equal to `'next_char'`
- `stars` is a list containing at least one tuple.

After the execution of the if-else block:
- If `c` is equal to `'*'`, the last element of `stars` is `(j, 'next_char')`.
- Otherwise, the last element of `stars` remains `(j+1, 'next_char')`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `c` should be the next character in `row` corresponding to the new value of `j`. Since `j` is incremented at the start of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be the previous value of `j` plus one. Let's denote the previous value of `j` as `j_prev`. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.

Given that `c` was `'next_char'` in the previous iteration, the new value of `c` will be the character at the position `j_prev + 1` in the string `row`. However, since we do not have the actual string `row` or its content, we can only express the state in terms of the increment of `j`.

So, the state adjustments would be:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `c` becomes the character at the new position `j` in the string `row`.

Since the exact character at the new position is not provided, we express it as `next_char_next`.

State: **`c` is equal to `next_char_next`, `stars` is a list containing at least one tuple.**
