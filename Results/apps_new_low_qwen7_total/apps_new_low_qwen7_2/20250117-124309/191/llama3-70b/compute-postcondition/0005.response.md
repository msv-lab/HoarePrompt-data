`stars.append((j, _))` appends a tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`. Since `_` is a placeholder and typically refers to the last value in the context where it is used (which is not specified here), and `j` is a variable whose value is not provided, we will keep it as `j`. The initial state does not provide the value of `j` or `_`, so we will represent them as they are.

The initial state is: `c` is equal to '*', and all other variables retain their values from the precondition. After executing the code, `stars` will have a new tuple appended to it, but without knowing the exact values of `j` and `_`, we cannot specify them further.

Output State: **`c` is equal to '*', `stars` is a list containing at least one tuple, the last element of `stars` is `(j, _)`**
