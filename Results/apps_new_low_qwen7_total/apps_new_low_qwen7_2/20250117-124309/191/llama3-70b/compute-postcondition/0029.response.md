Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The objects in the loop head are `j` and `c`, as well as the variable `row` which is being enumerated.

2. **Understand the enumeration process**: The `enumerate(row)` function will return pairs of `(index, character)` for each character in the string `row`.

3. **Determine the initial state for the loop**: For the loop to execute the first time, we need to determine what values `j` and `c` should have when the loop starts.

4. **Initial state of `row`**: We know that `j` is initially set to `len(row) - 1` and `c` is the last character in the string `row`.

5. **Condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute the first time, the length of `row` must be at least 1 because `enumerate` will produce an index for the first character if the string is non-empty.

Given this information, let's formulate the required initial states:

- `row` must be a non-empty string (i.e., its length must be at least 1).
- `j` must be equal to `len(row) - 1`.
- `c` must be the last character in the string `row`.

Therefore, the state for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: `total` is unspecified, `j` is `len(row) - 1`, `c` is the last character in the string `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_', `n` is `n - 1`, and `row` is a non-empty string.**
