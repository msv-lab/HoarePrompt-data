Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n > 0`
- `m` is an input integer
- `stars` is an empty list (`[]`)
- `row` is an input string

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for j, c in enumerate(row):
    if c == '*':
        stars.append((j, _))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `row` using `enumerate()`, which provides both the index `j` and the character `c`.
   - If the character `c` is equal to '*', it appends a tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`.

2. **Variables Invariant During the Loop**:
   - `n`: This variable is not mentioned in the loop, so we assume it is not affected by the loop.
   - `m`: This variable is also not mentioned in the loop, so it remains unchanged.
   - `row`: The string `row` itself is not modified within the loop.

3. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
   - `stars`: This list is updated if `c` is equal to '*'. Each time the condition is met, a new tuple `(j, _)` is appended to `stars`.

### Summary of Loop Behavior:
- The loop appends tuples to `stars` whenever a '*' character is encountered in `row`.
- The length of `stars` will be equal to the number of '*' characters in `row`.
- The index `j` in the tuple `(j, _)` represents the position of the '*' character in the string `row`.
- The `_` in the tuple `(j, _)` is a placeholder for the character following the '*', which is never used in the loop but might be relevant in context (though not specified).

### Edge Cases:
- If there are no '*' characters in `row`, the list `stars` will remain empty.
- If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., no '*' in `row`), `stars` will still be an empty list.

### Final Output State:
- `c`: The character `c` from the last iteration of the loop. Since the loop exits after processing the entire `row`, `c` will be the last character in `row`.
- `stars`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in `row` and a placeholder '_'.

### Output State:
Output State: **`c` is the last character in `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in `row` and a placeholder '_', and `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**
