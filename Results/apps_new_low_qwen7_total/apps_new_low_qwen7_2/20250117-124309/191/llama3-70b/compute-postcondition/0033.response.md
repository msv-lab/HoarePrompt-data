Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables:**
   - The loop head variables are `j` and `c`.
   - The loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`, with `j` being the index and `c` being the character at that index.

2. **Determine the current state:**
   - `total` is unspecified.
   - `j` is `len(row) - 1`.
   - `c` is the last character in the string `row`.
   - `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_'.
   - `n` is `n - 1`.
   - `row` is a non-empty string.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than the length of `row`.
   - Since `j` is currently `len(row) - 1`, the next value of `j` would be `len(row) - 2`.
   - `c` will be the character at index `len(row) - 2`.

4. **Consider the condition for adding to `stars`:**
   - If `c` is '*', then `stars` includes the tuple `(len(row) - 1, '_')`.
   - Since `c` is the last character, and it is not specified if it is '*', we need to consider the next character in the string.

5. **Update the state:**
   - `total` remains unspecified.
   - `j` is updated to `len(row) - 2`.
   - `c` is the character at index `len(row) - 2`.
   - `stars` may or may not include the tuple `(len(row) - 1, '_')` depending on the value of `c`.
   - `n` is updated to `n - 1`.
   - `row` remains a non-empty string.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`total` is unspecified, `j` is `len(row) - 2`, `c` is the second last character in the string `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_', `n` is `n - 1`, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `c` is '*', then `stars` includes the tuple `(len(row) - 1, '_')`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
