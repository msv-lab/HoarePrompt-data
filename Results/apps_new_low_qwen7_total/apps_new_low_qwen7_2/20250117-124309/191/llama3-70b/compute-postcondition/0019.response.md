Postcondition: ***`c` is the first character in the string `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder `_`. `m` remains unchanged. If `c` is '*', `stars` now includes an additional tuple `(j, _)`. Otherwise, the state of `stars` remains unchanged.***
