`stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_'. The code appends a new tuple `(j, _)` to this list. Since `c` is the last character in the string `row` and its value is '*', `j` is set to `len(row) - 1`. Therefore, the new tuple added to `stars` is `(len(row) - 1, _)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `j` is `len(row) - 1`, `c` is '*', `stars` is a list of tuples including `(len(row) - 1, _)`, `n` is `n - 1`, and `row` is a non-empty string.**
