Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop is defined as:
  ```python
  for (j, c) in enumerate(row):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `c` is the next character in the string `row` (denoted as `c_next`).
  - `j` is the index of this next character (denoted as `j_next`).
  - `stars` now includes an additional tuple `(j_next, _)` if `c_next` is '*', otherwise it remains the same.
  - `m` remains unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head uses variables `j` and `c`.
   - Therefore, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `j` and `c`.

2. **Determine New Values for `j` and `c`:**
   - In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (`j_next`).
   - `c` will be the next character in the string `row` starting from the position `j_next + 1`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `j_next + 1`.
   - `c` will be the character at the new index `j_next + 1` in the string `row`.
   - The `stars` list will remain the same unless the new character `c` is '*', in which case a new tuple `(j_next + 1, some_value)` will be added to `stars`.

### Updated State:

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 and `c` is the next character in the string `row`, the updated state should reflect these changes.

```plaintext
State: **`c` is the next character in the string `row` at index `j_next + 1`, `j` is `j_next + 1`, `stars` now includes an additional tuple `(j_next + 1, _)` if the character at index `j_next + 1` is '*', otherwise it remains the same, and `m` remains unchanged.**
```

This means that:
- `c` will be the character at the new index `j_next + 1`.
- `j` will be `j_next + 1`.
- `stars` will include the new tuple `(j_next + 1, _)` if the character at `j_next + 1` is '*'.
- `m` will remain unchanged.

Thus, the final answer is:

```plaintext
State: **`c` is the next character in the string `row` at index `j_next + 1`, `j` is `j_next + 1`, `stars` now includes an additional tuple `(j_next + 1, _)` if the character at index `j_next + 1` is '*', otherwise it remains the same, and `m` remains unchanged.**
