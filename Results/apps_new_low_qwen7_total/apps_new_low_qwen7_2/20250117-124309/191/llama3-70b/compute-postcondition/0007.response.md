Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `(j, c)` from the `enumerate(row)` expression. This means the variables `j` and `c` are being iterated over.

2. **Determine the initial states**:
   - `c` is equal to `*`
   - `stars` is a list containing at least one tuple
   - The last element of `stars` is `(j, *)`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `stars` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the tuples in `stars`, each iteration consumes one tuple.
   - After the last iteration, `c` was `*`, and the last element of `stars` was `(j, *)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the last element of `stars` must be the next tuple in the sequence, and `c` must be the second element of that tuple.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `c` will be the second element of the new last tuple in `stars`.
   - The last element of `stars` will now be the next tuple in the sequence.

Given that the last element of `stars` was `(j, *)` and `c` was `*`, for the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple should be the next pair in the sequence. Let's assume the next tuple is `(j+1, some_char)` where `some_char` is the new value of `c`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `c` will be the new character from the next tuple.
- The last element of `stars` will be the next tuple in the sequence.

Assuming the next tuple is `(j+1, 'next_char')` for the sake of this example:

State: **`c` is equal to 'next_char', `stars` is a list containing at least one tuple, and the last element of `stars` is `(j+1, 'next_char')`**
