The only variables in the loop head are `_` (which is just a placeholder) and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the last character in `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in `row` and a placeholder '_', and `n` and `m` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0.

Since `n` is decremented by 1 each time through the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`c` is the last character in `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in `row` and a placeholder '_', `n` must be greater than 0, `m` remains unchanged**.
