`row` is assigned the value of the user's input from the `input()` function. The value of `c` is the last character in this new `row`. The value of `stars` remains unchanged as it is a list of tuples containing the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_'. The value of `n` is still greater than 0, and the value of `m` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is the last character in the user's input `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_', `n` is greater than 0, `m` remains unchanged**
