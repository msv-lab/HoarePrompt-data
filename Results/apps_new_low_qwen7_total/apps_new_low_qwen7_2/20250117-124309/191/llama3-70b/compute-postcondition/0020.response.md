Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `j` and `c`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `row` using `enumerate()`. This means `c` takes the value of each character in `row` and `j` takes the corresponding index.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `c` will be the next character in the string `row`.
   - `j` will be the index of this next character.
   - The state of `stars` and `m` will be updated based on the value of `c`.

Given that `c` is the first character in the string `row` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to consider what happens when the loop executes again:

- If `c` is '*', then `stars` will include an additional tuple `(j, _)`.
- Otherwise, the state of `stars` remains unchanged.

Since we are starting a new iteration, `c` will be the next character in the string `row`. Let's denote this next character as `c_next` and the next index as `j_next`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `c` will change to `c_next`.
   - `j` will change to `j_next`.
   - If `c_next` is '*', then `stars` will include an additional tuple `(j_next, _)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`c` is the next character in the string `row` (denoted as `c_next`), `j` is the index of this next character (denoted as `j_next`), `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder `_`, and `m` remains unchanged. If `c_next` is '*', `stars` now includes an additional tuple `(j_next, _)`. Otherwise, the state of `stars` remains unchanged.**
