The code `stars.append((j, _))` appends a new tuple `(j, '_')` to the list `stars`. The value of `_` is typically used as a placeholder, but in this context, it is likely being replaced by `'next_char'` due to the initial state where `c` is equal to `'next_char'` and the last element of `stars` is `(j+1, 'next_char')`.

Given the initial state:
- `c` is equal to `'next_char'`
- `stars` is a list containing at least one tuple, and the last element of `stars` is `(j+1, 'next_char')`

After executing the code, the last element of `stars` will be updated to `(j, 'next_char')`.

Output State: **`c` is equal to 'next_char', `stars` is a list containing at least one tuple, and the last element of `stars` is (j, 'next_char')**
