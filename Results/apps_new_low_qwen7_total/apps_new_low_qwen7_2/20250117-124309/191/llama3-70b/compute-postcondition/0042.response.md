The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it processes a star map represented as a 2D list where each element is either a '.' (empty space) or '*' (star). The star map is defined by two dimensions: `n` rows and `m` columns, with both `n` and `m` being positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 1000.

Based on the given constraints and the representation of the star map, the function likely returns some form of result related to the star map, but since the specific output is not detailed, we can only describe the input representation and the parameters indirectly through the star map.

Functionality: **The function processes a star map represented as a 2D list where each element is either a '.' (empty space) or '*' (star), with the map dimensions being n rows and m columns, where 1 <= n, m <= 1000.**
