`stars` is updated by appending a new tuple `(j, _)` to it. If `c_next` is '*', then the new tuple is `(j_next, _)`. The value of `m` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`c`, `j`, and `c_next`) are also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is the next character in the string `row` (denoted as `c_next`), `j` is the index of this next character (denoted as `j_next`), `stars` now includes an additional tuple `(j_next, _)` if `c_next` is '*', otherwise it remains the same, and `m` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is the next character in the string `row` (denoted as `c_next`), `j` is the index of this next character (denoted as `j_next`), `stars` now includes an additional tuple `(j_next, _)` if `c_next` is '*', otherwise it remains the same, and `m` remains unchanged.**
