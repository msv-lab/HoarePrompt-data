`stars.append((j, _))` appends a new tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`. The value of `j` is `j_next + 1`, and `_` is the wildcard character, which is not explicitly defined but represents the second element of the tuple. Since the code does not change the values of `c`, `j`, `stars`, or `m`, these variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`c` is the next character in the string `row` at index `j_next + 1`, `j` is `j_next + 1`, `stars` now includes an additional tuple `(j_next + 1, _)` if the character at index `j_next + 1` is '*', otherwise it remains the same, and `m` remains unchanged.**
