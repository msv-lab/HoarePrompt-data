Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `j` is `len(row) - 2`, `c` is the second last character in the string `row`, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index of a '*' character in the original `row` and a placeholder '_', and `n` is `n - 1`. If `c` is '*', then `stars` includes the new tuple `(len(row) - 2, '_')`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
