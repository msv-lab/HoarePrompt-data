Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of rows \( n \) and columns \( m \) from the input.
2. It iterates through each row and column to find the positions of all stars (represented by `'*'`).
3. It calculates the minimum and maximum x-coordinates (columns) and y-coordinates (rows) of the stars.
4. The side length of the smallest square that can contain all the stars is calculated as the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates plus one.
5. The logic ensures that even if all stars are concentrated in one row or one column, the square side length will correctly capture this, thus providing the minimal side length required.

Given the steps outlined above, the provided program appears to follow the requirements accurately and will compute the correct minimal side length for any input adhering to the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
