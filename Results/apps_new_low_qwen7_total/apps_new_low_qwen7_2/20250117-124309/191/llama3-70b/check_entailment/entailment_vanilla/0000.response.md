Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of the star map.
2. It then iterates over each row to find the coordinates of all stars.
3. After collecting the coordinates of all stars, it calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates.
4. The side length of the smallest square that can cover all the stars is calculated as the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum x coordinates plus one, or the same calculation for the y coordinates plus one.
5. This approach ensures that the square covers all stars, and it correctly accounts for the fact that the square's sides must be parallel to the axes of the original rectangle.
6. The final printed value is the side length of this smallest square, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
