Reasoning:
The annotated program logic aims to find the minimum square that can cover all stars ('*') in the given star map. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Reading**: The code correctly reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the star map and stores them in variables `n` and `m`. It also reads the star map and identifies all positions of stars, storing these positions in a list `stars`.

2. **Finding Star Positions**: The nested loops are used to read each row of the star map and identify the column indices (`j`) where there is a star. These positions are stored in the list `stars` as tuples containing the column index and the row number. This part is correct.

3. **Identifying Extremes**: After the loop, the code calculates the minimum and maximum x-coordinates (`min_x` and `max_x`) and y-coordinates (`min_y` and `max_y`) of the stars. This is done using list comprehensions, which is correct.

4. **Calculating Minimum Square Side**: The side length of the smallest square that can cover all stars is determined by taking the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates plus one, and the same for the y-coordinates plus one. The larger of these two values is selected as the side length of the square. This is the correct approach to ensure the square covers all stars.

5. **Output**: The calculated side length is printed, which is the desired output.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
