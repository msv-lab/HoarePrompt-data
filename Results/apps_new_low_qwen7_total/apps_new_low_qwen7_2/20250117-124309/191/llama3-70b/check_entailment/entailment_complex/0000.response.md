Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly identifies the minimum bounding rectangle that contains all the stars.
2. It then calculates the side length of the smallest square that can contain this bounding rectangle.
3. The logic for finding the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the stars is correct.
4. The calculation of the side length of the square (which is the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum x or y coordinates plus one) is also correct.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the program correctly determines the minimal square that can contain all the stars.

Correctness: **True**
