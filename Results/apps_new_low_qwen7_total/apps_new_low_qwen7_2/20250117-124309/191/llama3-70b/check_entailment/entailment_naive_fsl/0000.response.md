Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the minimum side length of a square that can encompass all the stars on the star map. It iterates through each row to collect the coordinates of all stars, then finds the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates to determine the smallest possible square that can cover all stars. This approach ensures that the solution works for all given test cases and potential edge cases within the constraints provided. Since the program handles all described cases accurately, it is considered correct.
