The function processes a star map represented as a series of input lines, where each line consists of characters that are either '.' (empty space) or '*' (star). The map dimensions are given by the number of rows (n) and columns (m), with both values being in the range [1, 1000]. After processing, the function calculates and prints the side length of the smallest square that can contain all the stars present in the map. If there are no stars, the function still follows the same process but will print the side length of a square that would be able to contain the stars, which would be 1 in this case.
