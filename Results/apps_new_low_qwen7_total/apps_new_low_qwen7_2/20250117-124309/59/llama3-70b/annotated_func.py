#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, a is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and b is an integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ n.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    if (total_length <= n) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(-(-total_length // n))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, `b` is an integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ n, `total_length` is 2 \* (2a + b). If `total_length <= n`, then the function does nothing. Otherwise, the output of the print statement is `2 \* (2a + b) // n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user, where `n` is within the range [1, 1000], `a` is within the range [1, n], and `b` is within the range [1, n]. It calculates the total length as \(2 \times (2a + b)\). If this total length is less than or equal to `n`, the function prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints \(-(-\text{total\_length} // n)\), which effectively computes the ceiling division of `total_length` by `n`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program outputs either `1` or the ceiling division result based on the condition evaluated.
