The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but is described to operate within certain constraints: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and `b` is an integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ n. The output depends on these parameters, but since they are not passed as arguments to the function, we need to consider the possible return values based on the given constraints.

Given the lack of direct parameter inputs in the function definition, we infer that the function must internally handle these parameters. However, based solely on the information provided, we can describe the expected behavior:

- The function should validate that `n` is within the range [1, 1000].
- The function should validate that `a` is within the range [1, n].
- The function should validate that `b` is within the range [1, n].

Since the actual return values are not specified, we can only describe the input constraints and the expected behavior without specifying the exact return values.

Functionality: **The function validates that `n` is an integer within the range [1, 1000], `a` is an integer within the range [1, n], and `b` is an integer within the range [1, n].**
