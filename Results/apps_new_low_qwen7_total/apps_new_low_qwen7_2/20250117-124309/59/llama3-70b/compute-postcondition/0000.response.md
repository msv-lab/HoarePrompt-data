Output State: **n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, a is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, b is an integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ n, total_length is 2 * (a * 2 + b)**

Explanation:
- The first line reads an integer input for `n`.
- The second line reads an integer input for `a`.
- The third line reads an integer input for `b`.
- The fourth line calculates `total_length` as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`. This updates the value of `total_length` based on the values of `a` and `b`.
