The code `print(-(-total_length // n))` involves arithmetic operations on the variables `total_length` and `n`. The value of `total_length` is given as \(2 \times (2a + b)\). The code does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `n`, but rather calculates a new value based on these.

The expression `-(-total_length // n)` can be simplified as follows:
1. Calculate `total_length // n`: This is the integer division of `total_length` by `n`.
2. The double negative `-(-result)` simply negates the result of the integer division, which is equivalent to just taking the integer division result itself in this context because the negation cancels out.

Given that `total_length` is greater than `n`, the result of `total_length // n` will be at least 1 (since the division of a number greater than `n` by `n` will yield at least 1 when considering integer division).

Therefore, the expression `-(-total_length // n)` simplifies to `total_length // n`.

Since `total_length = 2 \times (2a + b)`, the output will be the integer division of `2 \times (2a + b)` by `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, `b` is an integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ n, `total_length` is 2 \* (2a + b), and the output of the print statement is `2 \* (2a + b) // n`**
