You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has equal wooden bars of length n. He wants to make a frame for two equal doors. Each frame has two vertical (left and right) sides of length a and one top side of length b. A solid (i.e. continuous without breaks) piece of bar is needed for each side.

Determine a minimal number of wooden bars which are needed to make the frames for two doors. Petya can cut the wooden bars into any parts, but each side of each door should be a solid piece of a wooden bar (or a whole wooden bar).


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the length of each wooden bar.

The second line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ n) — the length of the vertical (left and right) sides of a door frame.

The third line contains a single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ n) — the length of the upper side of a door frame.


-----Output-----

Print the minimal number of wooden bars with length n which are needed to make the frames for two doors.


-----Examples-----
Input
8
1
2

Output
1

Input
5
3
4

Output
6

Input
6
4
2

Output
4

Input
20
5
6

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example one wooden bar is enough, since the total length of all six sides of the frames for two doors is 8.

In the second example 6 wooden bars is enough, because for each side of the frames the new wooden bar is needed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    if total_length <= n:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-(-total_length // n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, a is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and b is an integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ n.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    if (total_length <= n) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(-(-total_length // n))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, `b` is an integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ n, `total_length` is 2 \* (2a + b). If `total_length <= n`, then the function does nothing. Otherwise, the output of the print statement is `2 \* (2a + b) // n`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of wooden bars required to make the frames for two doors. Specifically, the logic in the `if` statement is incorrect. The condition `if total_length <= n:` does not account for cases where multiple wooden bars are needed even if the total length exceeds the length of a single bar but not by a whole bar.

For example, consider the following input:
```
6
4
2
```
According to the problem description, the total length of the sides needed is `2 * (4 * 2 + 2) = 20`. Since `20` is greater than `6`, we need at least 4 wooden bars of length `6` to cover the total length. However, the program incorrectly prints `4` instead of the correct value, which is `4`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that if the total length is not less than or equal to `n`, we calculate the ceiling of the division of `total_length` by `n` to get the correct number of wooden bars. The corrected logic should be:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    print(math.ceil(total_length / n))
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles cases where the total length of the sides needed is not a multiple of `n`.
