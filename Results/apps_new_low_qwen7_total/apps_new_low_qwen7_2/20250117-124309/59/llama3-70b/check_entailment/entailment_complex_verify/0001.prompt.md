You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has equal wooden bars of length n. He wants to make a frame for two equal doors. Each frame has two vertical (left and right) sides of length a and one top side of length b. A solid (i.e. continuous without breaks) piece of bar is needed for each side.

Determine a minimal number of wooden bars which are needed to make the frames for two doors. Petya can cut the wooden bars into any parts, but each side of each door should be a solid piece of a wooden bar (or a whole wooden bar).


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the length of each wooden bar.

The second line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ n) — the length of the vertical (left and right) sides of a door frame.

The third line contains a single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ n) — the length of the upper side of a door frame.


-----Output-----

Print the minimal number of wooden bars with length n which are needed to make the frames for two doors.


-----Examples-----
Input
8
1
2

Output
1

Input
5
3
4

Output
6

Input
6
4
2

Output
4

Input
20
5
6

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example one wooden bar is enough, since the total length of all six sides of the frames for two doors is 8.

In the second example 6 wooden bars is enough, because for each side of the frames the new wooden bar is needed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    if total_length <= n:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-(-total_length // n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, a is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and b is an integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ n.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    if (total_length <= n) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(-(-total_length // n))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, `b` is an integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ n, `total_length` is 2 \* (2a + b). If `total_length <= n`, then the function does nothing. Otherwise, the output of the print statement is `2 \* (2a + b) // n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user, where `n` is within the range [1, 1000], `a` is within the range [1, n], and `b` is within the range [1, n]. It calculates the total length as \(2 \times (2a + b)\). If this total length is less than or equal to `n`, the function prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints \(-(-\text{total\_length} // n)\), which effectively computes the ceiling division of `total_length` by `n`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program outputs either `1` or the ceiling division result based on the condition evaluated.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads three integers from the input: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Total Length Calculation**: The total length of wood required for the frames of two doors is calculated as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`. This formula accounts for the two vertical sides (each of length `a`) and one horizontal top side (of length `b`) for each of the two doors.
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the total length required (`total_length`) fits within a single wooden bar of length `n`. If it does, it prints `1` indicating that only one wooden bar is needed.
4. **Ceiling Division**: If the total length exceeds the length of a single wooden bar, the program uses `-(-total_length // n)` to calculate the minimum number of wooden bars required. This is a way to perform ceiling division, ensuring that if there is any remainder, an additional wooden bar is accounted for.

The logic of calculating the total length and determining the number of wooden bars is sound. However, we need to ensure that the formula and the logic are applied correctly in all scenarios.

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: 
  - Input: `8 1 2`
  - Calculation: `2 * (1 * 2 + 2) = 2 * 4 = 8`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Example 2**: 
  - Input: `5 3 4`
  - Calculation: `2 * (3 * 2 + 4) = 2 * 10 = 20`
  - Output: `6` (Correct)

- **Example 3**: 
  - Input: `6 4 2`
  - Calculation: `2 * (4 * 2 + 2) = 2 * 10 = 20`
  - Output: `4` (Correct)

- **Example 4**: 
  - Input: `20 5 6`
  - Calculation: `2 * (5 * 2 + 6) = 2 * 16 = 32`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

All provided examples are handled correctly by the program.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
