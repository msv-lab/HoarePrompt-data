Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of wooden bars required to make the frames for two doors. Specifically, the logic in the `if` statement is incorrect. The condition `if total_length <= n:` does not account for cases where multiple wooden bars are needed even if the total length exceeds the length of a single bar but not by a whole bar.

For example, consider the following input:
```
6
4
2
```
According to the problem description, the total length of the sides needed is `2 * (4 * 2 + 2) = 20`. Since `20` is greater than `6`, we need at least 4 wooden bars of length `6` to cover the total length. However, the program incorrectly prints `4` instead of the correct value, which is `4`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that if the total length is not less than or equal to `n`, we calculate the ceiling of the division of `total_length` by `n` to get the correct number of wooden bars. The corrected logic should be:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    print(math.ceil(total_length / n))
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles cases where the total length of the sides needed is not a multiple of `n`.
