Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. It calculates the total length required for the frames of two doors, which is \(2 \times (2a + b)\).
3. The program checks if this total length can be constructed from a single wooden bar of length `n`. If it can, the function prints `1`.
4. If the total length cannot be constructed from a single wooden bar, the program uses the formula `-(-total_length // n)` to calculate how many wooden bars are needed. This formula effectively computes the ceiling of `total_length / n`, ensuring that we get the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division result.

Given the logic and calculations in the program, the implementation appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
