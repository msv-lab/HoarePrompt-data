You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Andrey received a postcard from Irina. It contained only the words "Hello, Andrey!", and a strange string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, snowflakes and candy canes. Andrey thought that this string is an encrypted message, and decided to decrypt it.

Andrey noticed that snowflakes and candy canes always stand after the letters, so he supposed that the message was encrypted as follows. Candy cane means that the letter before it can be removed, or can be left. A snowflake means that the letter before it can be removed, left, or repeated several times.

For example, consider the following string:  [Image] 

This string can encode the message «happynewyear». For this, candy canes and snowflakes should be used as follows:   candy cane 1: remove the letter w,  snowflake 1: repeat the letter p twice,  candy cane 2: leave the letter n,  snowflake 2: remove the letter w,  snowflake 3: leave the letter e. 

 [Image] 

Please note that the same string can encode different messages. For example, the string above can encode «hayewyar», «happpppynewwwwwyear», and other messages.

Andrey knows that messages from Irina usually have a length of $k$ letters. Help him to find out if a given string can encode a message of $k$ letters, and if so, give an example of such a message.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the string received in the postcard. The string consists only of lowercase Latin letters, as well as the characters «*» and «?», meaning snowflake and candy cone, respectively. These characters can only appear immediately after the letter. The length of the string does not exceed $200$.

The second line contains an integer number $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 200$), the required message length.


-----Output-----

Print any message of length $k$ that the given string can encode, or «Impossible» if such a message does not exist.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the removal of characters correctly when encountering a snowflake (`*`). Specifically, the program only appends the character before the snowflake once, even though a snowflake allows for the character to be removed or repeated multiple times. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs.

For example, consider the input string `hw?ap*yn?eww*ye*ar` with `k = 12`. The program outputs `happynewyear`, which is correct. However, consider the input string `abc??*d` with `k = 4`. The program should be able to generate strings like `abcd`, `ad`, `acd`, etc., but it will only output `abcd` because it does not handle the snowflake correctly to allow for the removal or repetition of characters.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

- For `abc??*d` with `k = 4`, the program should generate valid strings like `abcd`, `ad`, `acd`, `aad`, `aadcd`, etc. But it will only generate `abcd` since it only appends each character once before a snowflake.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the snowflake correctly by allowing for the removal or repetition of the preceding character.
