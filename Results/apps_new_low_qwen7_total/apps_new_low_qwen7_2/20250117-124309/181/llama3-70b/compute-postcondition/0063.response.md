The code prints "Impossible". This action does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p', 'a', 'l', 'e']`, `s` is `"apple"`, `k` is `3`, and `i` is `5`. The length of `ans` is not equal to `k`. After running the print statement, the output is "Impossible"."**
