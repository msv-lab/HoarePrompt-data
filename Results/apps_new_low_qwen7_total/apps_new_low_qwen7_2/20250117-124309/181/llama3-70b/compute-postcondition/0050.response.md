Let's analyze the given loop and the provided information step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The initial state is:
- `ans` = ['z', 'p', 'p', 'e']
- `s` = "apple"
- `k` > 3 (though `k` is not used in the loop)
- `len(ans)` < 4 (though `len(ans)` is actually 4, so this condition is false initially)
- `i` = 4

The loop condition is:
```
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
```

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- `ans`: This list will append characters from `s`.
- `i`: This index will increment by 2 each time the condition is met.
- `s`: The string remains unchanged as it is only read.
- `k`: Not used in the loop, so it remains constant.
- `len(ans)`: Initially 4, but changes within the loop if elements are appended.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue to execute as long as:
1. `i + 1` is less than the length of `s`.
2. The character at `s[i + 1]` is '*'.

Each iteration of the loop:
- Appends the character at `s[i]` to `ans`.
- Increments `i` by 2.

From the provided outputs, we see:
- After 1 iteration: `ans` = ['z', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'l'], `i` = 6, `s` = "apple*"
- After 2 iterations: `ans` = ['z', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'l', '*'], `i` = 8, `s` = "apple*"
- After 3 iterations: `ans` = ['z', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'l', '*', '*', 'char'], `i` = 9, `s` = "apple*"

### Step 4: Determine When the Loop Terminates
The loop will terminate when `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`. Given `s = "apple*"`, the string ends at index 5, and the next character (`s[6]`) is out of bounds.

To find the exact number of iterations:
- Initial `i` = 4
- After 1st iteration, `i` = 6
- After 2nd iteration, `i` = 8
- After 3rd iteration, `i` = 9 (out of bounds)

Thus, the loop will execute 3 times before terminating because `i + 1` (which is 10) exceeds the length of `s` (which is 5).

### Final Values
- `ans` will contain `['z', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'l', '*', '*', 'char']`.
- `i` will be 9.
- `s` remains "apple*".

### Output State
Output State: **ans is ['z', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'l', '*', '*', 'char'], i is 9, s is "apple*".**
