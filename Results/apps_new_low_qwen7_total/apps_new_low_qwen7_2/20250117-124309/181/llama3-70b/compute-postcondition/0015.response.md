The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 4, so after incrementing, `i` becomes 5. The other variables (`ans`, `k`, and `s`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is ['z', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'p', 'a'], `i` is 5, `k` must be greater than 3, `s` is 'apple'.

Output State: **`ans` is ['z', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'p', 'a'], `i` is 5, `k` must be greater than 3, `s` is 'apple'**
