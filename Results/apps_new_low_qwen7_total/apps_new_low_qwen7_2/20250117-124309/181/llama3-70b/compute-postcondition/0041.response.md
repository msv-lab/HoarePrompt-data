To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

The loop continues as long as:
1. `i < len(s)`
2. `len(ans) < k`

We need to ensure both conditions are met for the loop to continue.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i < len(s)`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than or equal to 4 (`i <= 4`).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than the length of the string `s`.
   - Since `s` is "apple" (which has a length of 5), the maximum value `i` can take without violating this condition is 4.

2. **Condition 2: `len(ans) < k`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p']`, so `len(ans)` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(ans)` must be less than `k`.
   - Given that `k` must be greater than 3, the minimum value `k` can take is 4.

### Adjusting the States:

- **`i`**: Since `i` is currently less than or equal to 4 and the maximum value for `i` to satisfy the condition `i < len(s)` is 4, `i` should remain 4.
- **`len(ans)`**: Since `len(ans)` is currently 3 and `k` must be greater than 3, the smallest possible value for `k` is 4, so `len(ans)` must be less than 4 to continue the loop. Therefore, `len(ans)` must be adjusted to be less than 4.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`ans` is ['z', 'p', 'p'], `s` is "apple", `k` must be greater than 3 and `len(ans)` must be less than 4, `i` is exactly 4**.
