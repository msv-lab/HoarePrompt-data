The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Given the initial conditions, `i` was such that `s[i]` is an alphabet character and `i + 1` is less than the length of `s` with `s[i + 1]` being '?'. After incrementing `i` by 2, the new value of `i` will be 2 more than its original value. However, since the exact original value of `i` is not specified, we can only state that `i` is now 2 more than its original value, which satisfies the conditions that `s[i]` is an alphabet character and `i + 1` is less than the length of `s` with `s[i + 1]` being '?'.

Output State: **`ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p', 'p']`, `s` is "apple", `k` is greater than 3, `i` is 2 more than its original value, and `s[i]` is an alphabet character, and the current value of `i + 1` is less than the length of `s` and `s[i + 1]` is equal to '?'**
