The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is exactly 4. Incrementing `i` by 1 changes its value to 5. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`ans` is ['z', 'p', 'p', 'e'], `s` is "apple", `k` must be greater than 3, `len(ans)` must be less than 4, `i` is 5, and (i + 1 >= len(s) or s[i + 1] != '*')**
