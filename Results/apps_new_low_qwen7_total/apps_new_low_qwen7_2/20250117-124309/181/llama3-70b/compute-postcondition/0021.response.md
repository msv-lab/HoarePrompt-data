The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. However, since the condition that the character at index `i` of `s` is not a letter still needs to be satisfied and `s` is "apple", the only valid index for `i` before incrementing would be 5 (since the string "apple" has 5 characters, and index 5 would be out of range). Incrementing `i` by 1 will make it 6, which is still out of range, satisfying the condition. 

Output State: **`ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p']`, `s` is "apple", `k` must be greater than 3, `i` is 6**
