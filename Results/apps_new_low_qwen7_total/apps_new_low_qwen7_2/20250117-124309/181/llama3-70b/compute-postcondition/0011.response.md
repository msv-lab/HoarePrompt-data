The first line `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of string `s` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 3 and `s` is 'apple', the character at index 3 is 'p'. Therefore, the list `ans` becomes `['z', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'p']`.

The second line `i += 2` increments the value of `i` by 2. Initially, `i` is 3, so after this operation, `i` becomes 5.

Since no other variables are affected, we can conclude the following:

Output State: **ans is ['z', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'p'], i is 5, k must be greater than 3, s is 'apple'**
