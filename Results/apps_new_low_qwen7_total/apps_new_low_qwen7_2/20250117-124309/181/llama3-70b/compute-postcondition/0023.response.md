Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p']`
   - `s` is "apple"
   - `k` must be greater than 3
   - `i` is 6

2. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(s)` and `len(ans) < k`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `len(s)` is 5 (since `s` is "apple")
   - `len(ans)` is 3 (since `ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p']`)
   - `k` must be greater than 3
   - `i` is 6

4. **Checking Loop Conditions:**
   - `i < len(s)` evaluates to `6 < 5`, which is false.
   - Since `i` is 6 and `len(s)` is 5, the first condition (`i < len(s)`) is already false.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to make sure that `i < len(s)` becomes true. This means `i` must be less than `len(s)`, which is 5.
   - We don't need to change anything related to `len(ans)` because even if `len(ans)` were to change, it would still be less than `k` (since `k` is greater than 3).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be less than 5.

**State:**
- `ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p']`
- `s` is "apple"
- `k` must be greater than 3
- `i` must be less than 5

State: **`ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p']`, `s` is "apple", `k` must be greater than 3, and `i` must be less than 5**
