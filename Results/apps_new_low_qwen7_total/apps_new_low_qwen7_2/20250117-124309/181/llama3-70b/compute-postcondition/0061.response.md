The code `print(''.join(ans))` joins the elements of the list `ans` into a single string without any separators. Since `ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p', 'a', 'l', 'e']`, joining these elements results in the string `'zppale'`. This operation does not change the values of `ans`, `s`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p', 'a', 'l', 'e']`, `s` is `"apple"`, `k` is `3`**
