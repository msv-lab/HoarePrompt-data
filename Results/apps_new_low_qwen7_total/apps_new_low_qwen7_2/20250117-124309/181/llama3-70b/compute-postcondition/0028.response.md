To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the loop condition:

The loop condition is:
```python
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop will continue as long as:
1. `i + 1` is less than the length of the string `s`.
2. The character at position `i + 1` in the string `s` is a `'*'`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans` is `['h']`
- `i` is `2`

We need to ensure both conditions are met for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1:** `i + 1 < len(s)`
   - Currently, `i` is `2`, so `i + 1` is `3`.
   - For this condition to be true, the length of `s` must be greater than `3`.

2. **Condition 2:** `s[i + 1] == '*'`
   - As established, `i + 1` is `3`.
   - For this condition to be true, the character at index `3` in the string `s` must be `'*'`.

Since these are the only conditions in the loop head, the states that need to be adjusted are the length of `s` and the character at index `3` in `s`.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`ans` is ['h'], `i` is 2, the length of `s` must be greater than 3, and the character at index 3 in `s` must be '*'**
