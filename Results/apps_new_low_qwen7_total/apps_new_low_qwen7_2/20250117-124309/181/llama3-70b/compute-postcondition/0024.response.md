The code `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of string `s` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state:

- `ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p']`
- `s` is "apple"
- `k` must be greater than 3
- `i` must be less than 5

We need to determine which character from `s` is appended to `ans` based on the value of `i`.

Since `i` must be less than 5, and considering the length of the string `s` is 5 (indices 0 through 4), `i` can take any value from 0 to 4. However, without a specific value for `i`, we cannot determine exactly which character is appended. But we know the updated list `ans` will be the original list plus one additional character.

Thus, the updated `ans` will be `['z', 'p', 'p', s[i]]`, where `s[i]` is one of 'a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e'.

Output State: **`ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p', 'a' or 'p' or 'p' or 'l' or 'e']`, `s` is "apple", `k` must be greater than 3, `i` must be less than 5**
