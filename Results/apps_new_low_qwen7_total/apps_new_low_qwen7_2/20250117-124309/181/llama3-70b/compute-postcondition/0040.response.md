Postcondition: ***`ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p']`, `s` is "apple", `k` must be greater than 3, `i` is less than or equal to 4, and the condition for `s[i]` being not an alphabetic character has been evaluated. If `s[i].isalpha()` is true, then `ans` is updated to `['z', 'p', 'p', 'a' or 'p' or 'p' or 'l' or 'e']`, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1` ensuring `i` is either 4 or 7, and `ans` is further modified to `['h', 'x', 'p']` if `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`. If `s[i].isalpha()` is false, `i` remains unchanged and is less than or equal to 4.***
