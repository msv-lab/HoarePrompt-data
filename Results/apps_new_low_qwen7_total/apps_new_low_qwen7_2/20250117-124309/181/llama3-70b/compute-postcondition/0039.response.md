`i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is less than 5, so after incrementing, `i` will be less than or equal to 4. However, since the original condition was that `s[i]` is not an alphabetic character, and knowing that `s` is "apple" (an alphabetic string), there is no index `i` in "apple" that is not an alphabetic character. This implies that the condition for `s[i]` being not an alphabetic character is no longer valid after the increment.

Output State: **`ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p']`, `s` is "apple", `k` is greater than 3, `i` is less than or equal to 4, and the condition for `s[i]` being not an alphabetic character is no longer valid.**
