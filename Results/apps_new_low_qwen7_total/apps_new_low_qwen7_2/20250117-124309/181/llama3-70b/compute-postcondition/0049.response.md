The initial state is: `ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'l', '*', '*',]`, `i` is 7.

The first line of the code appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 7, it tries to append `s[7]`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `s`, so we cannot determine the exact character to be appended without additional information. Assuming `s` is a string or list that can be indexed at `7`, let's denote the character at `s[7]` as `char`.

The second line increments `i` by 2, making `i` equal to 9.

Given the lack of a specific `s` string, the most accurate representation of the final state, based on the provided code, would be:

Output State: **ans is ['z', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'l', '*', '*', char], i is 9**

This reflects that `ans` has been modified by appending the character at index 7 of `s`, and `i` has been incremented by 2.
