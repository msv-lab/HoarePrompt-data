Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it can execute the first time.

### Given Loop
```python
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial States
- `ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p', 'a' or 'p' or 'p' or 'l' or 'e']`
- `s` is "apple"
- `k` must be greater than 3
- `i` must be less than 5

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition inside the `while` loop is `i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*'`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, both parts of the condition must be true:
     - `i + 1 < len(s)` ensures that the index `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
     - `s[i + 1] == '*'` checks if the character at position `i + 1` in the string `s` is an asterisk (`*`).

2. **String `s`:**
   - The string `s` is "apple".
   - The length of `s` is 5 (i.e., `len(s) = 5`).

3. **Index `i`:**
   - `i` must be less than 5 (as given).
   - To satisfy the condition `i + 1 < len(s)`, `i` must be less than 4 (since `i + 1` must be less than 5).

4. **Character at Position `i + 1`:**
   - We need to check the character at each possible value of `i + 1` (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4) in the string "apple":
     - `s[1]` is 'p'
     - `s[2]` is 'p'
     - `s[3]` is 'l'
     - `s[4]` is 'e'
   - None of these characters are '*'.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis above, there is no value of `i` such that `s[i + 1] == '*'`. Therefore, the condition `s[i + 1] == '*'` cannot be satisfied for any valid value of `i` that meets the requirement `i < 5`.

### Final State
Since the condition `s[i + 1] == '*'` cannot be met, the loop will never execute even once. Thus, no adjustment to the states is necessary to make the loop execute the first time.

**State:**
**`ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p', 'a' or 'p' or 'p' or 'l' or 'e']`, `s` is "apple", `k` must be greater than 3, `i` must be less than 5**
