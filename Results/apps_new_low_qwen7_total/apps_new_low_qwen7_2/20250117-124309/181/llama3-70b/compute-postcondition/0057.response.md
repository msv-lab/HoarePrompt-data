The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p']`, `s` is "apple", `k` must be greater than 3 and `len(ans)` must be less than 4, `i` is 5, `s[i]` is not alphabetic.

Output State: **`ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p']`, `s` is "apple", `k` must be greater than 3 and `len(ans)` must be less than 4, `i` is 5, `s[i]` is not alphabetic**
