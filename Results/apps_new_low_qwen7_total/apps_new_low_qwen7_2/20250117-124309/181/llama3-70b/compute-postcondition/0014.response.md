Let's analyze the given Python loop and the provided states step-by-step.

### Initial State Analysis
- **Postcondition**: `ans` is `['z', 'p', 'p', 'p']`, `s` is "apple", `k` must be greater than 3, `i` is an index where `s[i]` is an alphabet character, and `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`.

### Loop Code Analysis
```python
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
    ans.append(s[i])
    i += 2
```

### Step-by-Step Execution
1. **First Iteration**:
   - Condition check: `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`
     - For `s = 'apple'` and initial `i = 4` (since `s[4]` is 'p' and `s[4+1]` is '*'), the condition is satisfied.
   - Append `s[i]` to `ans`: `ans` becomes `['z', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'e']`
   - Increment `i` by 2: `i` becomes `6` (but since `len(s) = 5`, it wraps around to `i = 0` and fails the condition).

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - For `i = 0` and `s = 'apple'`, `i + 1 = 1` (and `s[1]` is 'p' and `s[1+1]` is '*'), the condition is satisfied.
   - Append `s[i]` to `ans`: `ans` becomes `['z', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'p']`
   - Increment `i` by 2: `i` becomes `2`.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - For `i = 2` and `s = 'apple'`, `i + 1 = 3` (and `s[3]` is 'p' and `s[3+1]` is '*'), the condition is satisfied.
   - Append `s[i]` to `ans`: `ans` becomes `['z', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'p', 'a']`
   - Increment `i` by 2: `i` becomes `4`.

4. **Fourth Iteration**:
   - For `i = 4` and `s = 'apple'`, `i + 1 = 5` (which is out of bounds), the condition fails.

### Invariant Variables
- `k`: Must be greater than 3.
- `s`: Remains "apple".
- `i`: Changes based on the loop condition and increment but eventually reaches the end of the string.

### Final State Calculation
- **Final `ans`**: After three iterations, `ans` will be `['z', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'p', 'a']`.
- **Final `i`**: `i` will be `4` because the loop stops when `i + 1` exceeds the length of `s`.
- **Final `k`**: Remains greater than 3 as no changes are made to `k` within the loop.
- **Final `s`**: Remains "apple" as no changes are made to `s`.

### Output State
Output State: **ans is ['z', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'p', 'a'], i is 4, k must be greater than 3, s is 'apple'.**
