Postcondition: ***`ans` is ['z', 'p', 'p', 'e'], `s` is "apple", `k` is greater than 3, `len(ans)` is less than 4, `i` is either 5 or 10 depending on whether `s[i + 1]` is '*', `ans` is updated to include 'l' and '*' if `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` is set to 5.***
