The initial state is as follows: `ans` is `['h', 'x']`, `i` is 4, and the condition `len(s) > 5` and `s[5] == '*'` must be true.

Let's analyze the code block:

```python
ans.append(s[i])
i += 2
```

- The first line appends the character at index `i` in string `s` to the list `ans`.
- The second line increments the value of `i` by 2.

Since `i` is initially 4, the first line appends `s[4]` to `ans`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 2, making it 6. Therefore, `i` now becomes 6.

The final state of `ans` will include `['h', 'x', s[4]]`, and the final value of `i` is 6. The value of `s` is not provided explicitly, but we know `len(s) > 5` and `s[5] == '*'`.

Given the conditions and the operations, the final output state is:

Output State: **ans is ['h', 'x', s[4]], i is 6**
