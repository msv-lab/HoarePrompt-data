The first line `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the list `ans`. Given that `s` is "apple*" and `i` is 6, the character at index 6 is '*', so `ans` becomes `['z', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'l', '*']`. The second line `i += 2` increments `i` by 2, changing its value to 8. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **ans is ['z', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'l', '*'], i is 8**
