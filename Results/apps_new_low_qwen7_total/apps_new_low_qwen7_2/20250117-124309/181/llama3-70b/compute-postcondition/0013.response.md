The first line `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the list `ans`. Given that `s` is 'apple' and `i` must be less than 4, the valid values for `i` (since `i` is less than 4) could be 0, 1, or 2. However, since `i` must also be an integer, we need to determine the actual value of `i`.

The second line `i += 2` increments `i` by 2. Since `i` must be less than 4 initially and must be an integer, let's consider the possible values:

- If `i` is 0 initially, then after incrementing by 2, `i` becomes 2.
- If `i` is 1 initially, then after incrementing by 2, `i` becomes 3, which is still valid.
- If `i` is 2 initially, then after incrementing by 2, `i` becomes 4, which is not valid because `i` must be less than 4.

Given these constraints, the valid initial values for `i` are 0, 1, or 2. Let's assume the smallest valid value, `i` is 0, to keep it simple. 

1. `ans.append(s[i])`: For `i` being 0, `s[i]` is 'a'. So, `ans` becomes `['z', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'p', 'a']`.
2. `i += 2`: This changes `i` from 0 to 2.

Since `i` is incremented to 2, the next iteration would not append any new element as `i` would exceed the length of the string 'apple'.

Therefore, the final state of the variables is:
Output State: **ans is ['z', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'p', 'a'], i is 2, k is greater than 3, s is 'apple'**
