The initial state is:
- `ans` is ['h']
- `i` is 2
- The length of `s` is greater than 3
- The character at index 3 in `s` is '*'

The code block is:
```
ans.append(s[i])
i += 2
```

First, the line `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` in `s` to `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 2, we append `s[2]` to `ans`. Since the character at index 3 in `s` is '*', `s[2]` must be the character before '*', which is not specified but can be any character. For simplicity and based on the given condition, let's assume `s[2]` is 'x' (though it could be any character, the exact character doesn't affect the general logic).

So, `ans` becomes `['h', 'x']`.

Next, the line `i += 2` increments `i` by 2. Since `i` was initially 2, it now becomes `i = 4`.

Thus, after executing the entire code block, the final state is:
Output State: **ans is ['h', 'x'], i is 4**
