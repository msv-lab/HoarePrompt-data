Output State: **ans is ['z', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'l'], i is 6, s is "apple*"**

Explanation:
- The initial state has `ans` as `['z', 'p', 'p', 'e']`, `s` as `"apple*"`, `k` greater than 3 and `len(ans)` less than 4, and `i` as 4.
- The first line `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of `s` to `ans`. Since `i` is 4, it appends `'l'` to `ans`, making `ans` `['z', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'l']`.
- The second line `i += 2` increments `i` by 2, changing `i` from 4 to 6.
- There are no other variables affected by the given code block.
- Therefore, the final output state is as described above.
