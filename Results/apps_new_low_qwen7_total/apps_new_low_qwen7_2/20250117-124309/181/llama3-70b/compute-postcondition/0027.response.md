Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the final state after executing the code. However, the initial state is missing the values of `ans` and `s`, and the starting value of `i`. Since these values are not provided, we will assume some initial values for `ans`, `s`, and `i` to proceed with the example.

Let's assume:
- `ans` is an empty list `[]`
- `s` is a string, say `"hello"`
- `i` is an integer, say `0`

Now, let's execute the code:

```python
ans.append(s[i])
i += 2
```

1. The first line `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` in the string `s` to the list `ans`. Initially, `s` is `"hello"`, and `i` is `0`. So, `s[0]` is `'h'`. After this line, `ans` becomes `['h']`.

2. The second line `i += 2` increments the value of `i` by 2. Initially, `i` is `0`. After this line, `i` becomes `2`.

After executing both lines, the updated state is:
- `ans` is `['h']`
- `i` is `2`

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **ans is ['h'], i is 2**
