The code appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is exactly 4, so `ans.append(s[4])` appends the 5th character of the string "apple" to the list `ans`. The 5th character of "apple" is 'e'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is ['z', 'p', 'p', 'e'], `s` is "apple", `k` must be greater than 3 and `len(ans)` must be less than 4, `i` is exactly 4**
