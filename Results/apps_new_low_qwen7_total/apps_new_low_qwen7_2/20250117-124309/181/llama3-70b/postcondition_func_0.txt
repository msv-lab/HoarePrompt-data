The function `func` accepts a string `s` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?», with a maximum length of 200, and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 200. It constructs a new list `ans` by iterating through the string `s` and appending characters to `ans` under certain conditions. Specifically, it appends characters that are alphabetic and handles special cases where the character is followed by «*» or «?». After processing, if the length of `ans` equals `k`, it prints the joined string of `ans`. Otherwise, it prints "Impossible". Potential edge cases include strings with no alphabetic characters or invalid input lengths.
