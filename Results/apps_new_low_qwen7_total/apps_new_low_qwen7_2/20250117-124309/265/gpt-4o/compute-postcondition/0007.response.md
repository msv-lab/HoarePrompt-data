Let's analyze the given Python loop and the provided information step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State

The loop iterates over integers starting from 2 up to `n`. For each iteration, it updates the `result` variable as follows:
```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    result = result * i % MOD
```

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes

- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1,000,000\)
  - `result` is initialized to 1.

- **Variables Updated in Each Iteration**:
  - The variable `result` is updated by multiplying it with the current value of `i` and taking modulo `MOD`.

- **Invariants**:
  - The variable `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `n`.
  - The variable `result` is always updated by multiplying it with the current value of `i` and then taking modulo `MOD`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior

- **Loop Execution**: The loop will execute exactly `n - 1` times because `i` starts at 2 and goes up to `n`.
- **Final Value of `result`**: After `n - 1` iterations, `result` will be the product of all integers from 2 to `n`, modulo `MOD`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships

Given the output states after the loop has executed 1, 2, and 3 times:
- After 1 time: `result` is `result * 2 % MOD`
- After 2 times: `result` is `result * 4 % MOD`
- After 3 times: `result` is `result * 5 % MOD`

These observations confirm that the loop multiplies `result` by consecutive integers starting from 2 up to `n` and takes modulo `MOD`.

### Final Output State

After the loop has executed `n - 1` times, `result` will be the product of all integers from 2 to `n`, taken modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **result is `(2 * 3 * ... * n) % MOD`**
