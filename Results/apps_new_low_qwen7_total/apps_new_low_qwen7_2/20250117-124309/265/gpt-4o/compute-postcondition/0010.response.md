Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 1,000,000\)) and calculates the product of all integers from 2 to \(n\) modulo `MOD`. The function returns this result. There are no missing functionalities in the given code. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `result` holds the value of \((2 \times 3 \times \ldots \times n) \mod \text{MOD}\).**

Note: The function assumes that `MOD` is defined elsewhere in the code. If `MOD` is not defined, the function will not run correctly, leading to undefined behavior. This should be considered an edge case or an external requirement.
