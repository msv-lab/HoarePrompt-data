The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. The function returns `ways`, which is calculated as (2^m * fact_n * (fact_n_m^(-1) mod 10^9 + 7) mod 10^9 + 7).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `m`, and return the value of `ways` as defined by the given formula.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, and returns `ways` as calculated by the formula (2^m * fact_n * (fact_n_m^(-1) mod 10^9 + 7) mod 10^9 + 7).**
