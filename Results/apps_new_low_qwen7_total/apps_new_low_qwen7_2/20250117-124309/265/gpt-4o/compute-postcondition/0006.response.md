The code snippet updates the `result` variable by performing the operation `result = result * i % MOD`. However, the initial state does not define the value of `MOD`, and the value of `result` is not specified. Given that `i` is 5, the output state will include this updated value for `result`, but without a specific value for `MOD` or `result`, we cannot determine the exact numeric value of `result`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 5, `result` is `result` * 5 % MOD**
