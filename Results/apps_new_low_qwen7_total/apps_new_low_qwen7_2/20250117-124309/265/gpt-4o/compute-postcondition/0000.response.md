Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, fact_n is the factorial of n modulo 10^9 + 7, fact_n_m is the factorial of (n - m) modulo 10^9 + 7, ways is calculated as (2^m * fact_n * (fact_n_m^(-1) mod 10^9 + 7) mod 10^9 + 7)**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates the factorial of `n` and takes it modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Let's denote this as `fact_n`.
- The second line calculates the factorial of `(n - m)` and takes it modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Let's denote this as `fact_n_m`.
- The third line calculates `ways` using the formula provided, which involves raising 2 to the power of `m` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), multiplying it by `fact_n`, and then multiplying the result by the modular inverse of `fact_n_m` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is done under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state, while `fact_n` and `fact_n_m` are updated based on the new definitions, and `ways` is computed based on these values.
