Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, where `1 ≤ m ≤ n` and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. It calculates the value of `ways` using the formula \(2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), where \(\text{fact}_n\) is the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function returns `ways`. Potential edge cases include when `m` equals `n`, in which case \(\text{fact}_{n-m}\) would be \(\text{fact}_0\), and when `m` is 1, simplifying the calculation. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; however, the function assumes that `func_1` correctly computes the factorial modulo \(10^9 + 7\).**
