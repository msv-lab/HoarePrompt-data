You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an airplane which has n rows from front to back. There will be m people boarding this airplane.

This airplane has an entrance at the very front and very back of the plane.

Each person has some assigned seat. It is possible for multiple people to have the same assigned seat. The people will then board the plane one by one starting with person 1. Each person can independently choose either the front entrance or back entrance to enter the plane.

When a person walks into the plane, they walk directly to their assigned seat and will try to sit in it. If it is occupied, they will continue walking in the direction they walked in until they are at empty seat - they will take the earliest empty seat that they can find. If they get to the end of the row without finding a seat, they will be angry.

Find the number of ways to assign tickets to the passengers and board the plane without anyone getting angry. Two ways are different if there exists a passenger who chose a different entrance in both ways, or the assigned seat is different. Print this count modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Input-----

The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000), the number of seats, and the number of passengers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single number, the number of ways, modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Example-----
Input
3 3

Output
128



-----Note-----

Here, we will denote a passenger by which seat they were assigned, and which side they came from (either "F" or "B" for front or back, respectively).

For example, one valid way is 3B, 3B, 3B (i.e. all passengers were assigned seat 3 and came from the back entrance). Another valid way would be 2F, 1B, 3F.

One invalid way would be 2B, 2B, 2B, since the third passenger would get to the front without finding a seat.

- Program: 
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % MOD
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    fact_n = func_1(n)
    fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)
    ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
    return ways



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
result = func_2(n, m)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of seats on the airplane, and 1 <= n <= 1 000 000.
def func_1(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: result is `(2 * 3 * ... * n) % MOD`
    return result
    #The program returns the value of 'result', which is calculated as (2 * 3 * ... * n) % MOD

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(n, m):
    fact_n = func_1(n)

fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)

ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
    return ways
    #The program returns ways, which is calculated as (2^m * fact_n * (fact_n_m^(-1) mod 10^9 + 7) mod 10^9 + 7)




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of ways passengers can board the plane without getting angry. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that each passenger can choose either the front or back entrance independently, and it needs to consider all possible combinations of entrances chosen by the passengers.

The program defines `func_1` to compute the factorial of a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\), and `func_2` to compute a value using factorials and modular exponentiation. However, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The calculation `pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD` does not accurately represent the number of valid boarding sequences.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to consider the following:

1. Each of the \(m\) passengers can independently choose between the front and back entrances.
2. For each passenger, the number of ways to assign seats such that no one gets angry depends on the distribution of passengers across the front and back entrances.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of valid ways to distribute passengers across the front and back entrances such that no one gets stuck at the end of the row. This involves combinatorial counting and careful consideration of the constraints.

Since the provided program does not correctly handle these aspects, it fails to meet the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
