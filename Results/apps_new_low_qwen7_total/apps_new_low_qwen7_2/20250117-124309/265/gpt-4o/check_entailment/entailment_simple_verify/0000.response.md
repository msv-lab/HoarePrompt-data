### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

#### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
This function calculates the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The logic here is straightforward and correct. 

```python
def func_1(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % MOD
    return result
```

This function works correctly for computing \((2 \times 3 \times \ldots \times n) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`
This function attempts to compute the number of valid boarding sequences. Here is the breakdown of its logic:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    fact_n = func_1(n)
    fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)
    ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
    return ways
```

1. **`fact_n`**: This is the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
2. **`fact_n_m`**: This is the factorial of \(n - m\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. **`pow(2, m, MOD)`**: This computes \(2^m \mod (10^9 + 7)\), representing the number of ways passengers can independently choose either the front or back entrance.
4. **`pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD)`**: This computes the modular inverse of `fact_n_m` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The modular inverse is used to divide by `fact_n_m`.

However, the multiplication `pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD` does not correctly reflect the combinatorial counting required for the problem. Specifically, the formula needs to account for the distribution of passengers across the front and back entrances and ensure that no one gets stuck at the end of the row.

#### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use combinatorial counting. The correct approach involves calculating the number of valid ways to distribute passengers such that no one gets stuck at the end of the row. This can be done using binomial coefficients and considering the placement of passengers in both the front and back sections.

The correct formula to calculate the number of valid boarding sequences is:
\[ \sum_{k=0}^{m} \binom{m}{k} \cdot 2^k \cdot k! \cdot (n-k)! \]
where \( \binom{m}{k} \) represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) passengers out of \(m\) to go through the front entrance, and \(2^k\) accounts for the choices of entrance for those passengers. The remaining \(m-k\) passengers must go through the back entrance, and we need to arrange them in the remaining seats.

Given the complexity of the problem, the provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the combinatorial counting required.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
