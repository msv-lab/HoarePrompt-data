### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane such that no passenger gets angry.
   - A passenger can choose either the front or back entrance, and will occupy the first available seat in their chosen direction.
   - We need to calculate this modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analysis of Given Functions**:
   - `func_1(n)` calculates \(n!\) (factorial of \(n\)) using modular arithmetic.
   - `func_2(n, m)` uses the results from `func_1` to compute the total number of valid boarding sequences:
     - `fact_n` is the factorial of \(n\).
     - `fact_n_m` is the factorial of \(n - m\).
     - The formula used is \(\text{ways} = 2^m \cdot \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula \(2^m \cdot \frac{n!}{(n - m)!}\) correctly counts the number of ways to assign seats and entrances without conflicts.
   - However, the given code does not correctly handle the division under modular arithmetic. Specifically, calculating the modular inverse of \((n - m)!\) using `pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD)` is incorrect because it assumes \((n - m)!\) has a multiplicative inverse, which is not true for all values of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - For instance, when \(n - m = 0\), \((n - m)!\) is 1, which does not require a modular inverse. But for other cases, the modular inverse might not exist or might lead to incorrect results due to the properties of modular arithmetic.

4. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code states that `result` in `func_1` is \((2 * 3 * ... * n) \% MOD\), which is correct.
   - In `func_2`, `fact_n` and `fact_n_m` are correctly calculated as factorials.
   - The calculation of `ways` as \(2^m \cdot \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) is conceptually correct but fails due to the incorrect handling of modular inverses.

### Conclusion:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains a critical flaw in the calculation of the modular inverse, leading to potential incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

**Correctness: False**

**Final: False**
