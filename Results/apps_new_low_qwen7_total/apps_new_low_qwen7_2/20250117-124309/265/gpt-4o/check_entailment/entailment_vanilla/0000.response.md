### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to determine the number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane such that no passenger gets angry.
   - A passenger can choose either the front or back entrance, and will occupy the first available seat in their chosen direction.
   - We need to calculate this modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analysis of Given Functions**:
   - `func_1(n)` calculates \(n!\) (factorial of \(n\)) using modular arithmetic.
   - `func_2(n, m)` uses the results from `func_1` to compute the total number of valid boarding sequences:
     - `fact_n` is the factorial of \(n\).
     - `fact_n_m` is the factorial of \(n - m\).
     - The formula used is \(\text{ways} = 2^m \cdot \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula \(2^m \cdot \frac{n!}{(n - m)!}\) correctly counts the number of ways to assign seats and entrances without conflicts.
   - The use of modular inverse (`pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD)`) ensures the division operation is handled correctly under modulo arithmetic.
   - The overall structure of the code follows the problem requirements accurately.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
