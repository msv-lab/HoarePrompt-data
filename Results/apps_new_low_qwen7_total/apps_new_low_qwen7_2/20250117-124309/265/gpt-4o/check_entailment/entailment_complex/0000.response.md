Reasoning:
- The program reads input and splits it to extract `n` and `m`.
- `func_1` computes the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- `func_2` uses `func_1` to compute necessary factorials and then applies the formula for the number of ways passengers can board the plane without getting angry.

The provided functions seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is read correctly and split into `n` and `m`.

2. **Factorial Calculation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function calculates \((2 \times 3 \times \ldots \times n) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - This is done correctly using a simple for loop.

3. **Main Computation (`func_2`)**:
   - `func_2` first calculates `fact_n` using `func_1(n)`.
   - Then, it calculates `fact_n_m` using `func_1(n - m)`.
   - The expression \(2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) is used to find the number of ways passengers can board without getting angry.
   - The modular inverse is computed using Fermat's Little Theorem, which is valid because \(10^9 + 7\) is a prime number.

Given that the logic follows the problem requirements and all steps are implemented correctly, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
