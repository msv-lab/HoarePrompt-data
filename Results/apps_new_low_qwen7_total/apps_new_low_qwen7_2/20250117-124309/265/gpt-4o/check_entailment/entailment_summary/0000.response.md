### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the number of ways to assign seats and boarding entrances such that no one gets angry.
   - Each person can choose between the front and back entrance.
   - If a person's assigned seat is occupied, they will keep moving until they find an empty seat.
   - If they reach the end of the row without finding a seat, they get angry.
   - We need to compute the total number of valid ways modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analysis of Provided Functions:**
   - **`func_1(n)`**:
     - This function computes the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It correctly iterates through numbers from 2 to `n`, multiplying them together and taking the modulo at each step.
   - **`func_2(n, m)`**:
     - This function uses `func_1` to compute factorials and then applies the formula for the number of valid boarding sequences.
     - The formula used is \(2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
       - \(2^m\) accounts for the choice of entrance for each of the `m` passengers.
       - \(\text{fact}_n\) is the factorial of the total number of seats.
       - \(\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1}\) is the modular inverse of the factorial of the remaining seats, ensuring the formula works correctly under modulo arithmetic.
   - **Modular Inverse Calculation**:
     - The modular inverse of \(\text{fact}_{n-m}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is computed using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for a prime \(p\), \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p\). Hence, \(a^{p-2} \equiv a^{-1} \mod p\).
     - This ensures that the division operation in the formula is valid under modulo arithmetic.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `m = n`, \(\text{fact}_{n-m} = \text{fact}_0 = 1\), and the formula simplifies correctly.
   - When `m = 1`, the formula also simplifies to a valid computation.

Given that:
- `func_1` correctly computes the factorial modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- `func_2` correctly uses the factorials and modular inverses to compute the number of valid ways.
- All calculations are performed under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to avoid overflow issues.

### Conclusion:
The given implementation correctly addresses the problem requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
