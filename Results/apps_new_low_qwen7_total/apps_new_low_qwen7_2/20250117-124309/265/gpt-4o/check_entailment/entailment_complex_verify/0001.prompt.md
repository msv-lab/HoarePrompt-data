You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an airplane which has n rows from front to back. There will be m people boarding this airplane.

This airplane has an entrance at the very front and very back of the plane.

Each person has some assigned seat. It is possible for multiple people to have the same assigned seat. The people will then board the plane one by one starting with person 1. Each person can independently choose either the front entrance or back entrance to enter the plane.

When a person walks into the plane, they walk directly to their assigned seat and will try to sit in it. If it is occupied, they will continue walking in the direction they walked in until they are at empty seat - they will take the earliest empty seat that they can find. If they get to the end of the row without finding a seat, they will be angry.

Find the number of ways to assign tickets to the passengers and board the plane without anyone getting angry. Two ways are different if there exists a passenger who chose a different entrance in both ways, or the assigned seat is different. Print this count modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Input-----

The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000), the number of seats, and the number of passengers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single number, the number of ways, modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Example-----
Input
3 3

Output
128



-----Note-----

Here, we will denote a passenger by which seat they were assigned, and which side they came from (either "F" or "B" for front or back, respectively).

For example, one valid way is 3B, 3B, 3B (i.e. all passengers were assigned seat 3 and came from the back entrance). Another valid way would be 2F, 1B, 3F.

One invalid way would be 2B, 2B, 2B, since the third passenger would get to the front without finding a seat.

- Program: 
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % MOD
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    fact_n = func_1(n)
    fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)
    ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
    return ways



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
result = func_2(n, m)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of seats on the airplane, and 1 <= n <= 1 000 000.
def func_1(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: result is `(2 * 3 * ... * n) % MOD`
    return result
    #The program returns the value of 'result', which is calculated as (2 * 3 * ... * n) % MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 1,000,000\)) and calculates the product of all integers from 2 to \(n\) modulo `MOD`. The function returns this result. There are no missing functionalities in the given code. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `result` holds the value of \((2 \times 3 \times \ldots \times n) \mod \text{MOD}\).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(n, m):
    fact_n = func_1(n)

fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)

ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
    return ways
    #The program returns ways, which is calculated as (2^m * fact_n * (fact_n_m^(-1) mod 10^9 + 7) mod 10^9 + 7)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, where `1 ≤ m ≤ n` and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. It calculates the value of `ways` using the formula \(2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), where \(\text{fact}_n\) is the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function returns `ways`. Potential edge cases include when `m` equals `n`, in which case \(\text{fact}_{n-m}\) would be \(\text{fact}_0\), and when `m` is 1, simplifying the calculation. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; however, the function assumes that `func_1` correctly computes the factorial modulo \(10^9 + 7\).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to determine the number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane such that no passenger gets angry.
   - A passenger can choose either the front or back entrance, and will occupy the first available seat in their chosen direction.
   - We need to calculate this modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analysis of Given Functions**:
   - `func_1(n)` calculates \(n!\) (factorial of \(n\)) using modular arithmetic.
   - `func_2(n, m)` uses the results from `func_1` to compute the total number of valid boarding sequences:
     - `fact_n` is the factorial of \(n\).
     - `fact_n_m` is the factorial of \(n - m\).
     - The formula used is \(\text{ways} = 2^m \cdot \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula \(2^m \cdot \frac{n!}{(n - m)!}\) correctly counts the number of ways to assign seats and entrances without conflicts.
   - The use of modular inverse (`pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD)`) ensures the division operation is handled correctly under modulo arithmetic.
   - The overall structure of the code follows the problem requirements accurately.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
