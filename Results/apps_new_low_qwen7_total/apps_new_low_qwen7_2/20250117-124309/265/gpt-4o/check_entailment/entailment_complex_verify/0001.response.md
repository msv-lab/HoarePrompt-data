### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane such that no passenger gets angry.
   - A passenger can choose either the front or back entrance, and will occupy the first available seat in their chosen direction.
   - We need to calculate this modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analysis of Given Functions**:
   - `func_1(n)` calculates \(n!\) (factorial of \(n\)) using modular arithmetic.
   - `func_2(n, m)` uses the results from `func_1` to compute the total number of valid boarding sequences:
     - `fact_n` is the factorial of \(n\).
     - `fact_n_m` is the factorial of \(n - m\).
     - The formula used is \(\text{ways} = 2^m \cdot \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula \(2^m \cdot \frac{n!}{(n - m)!}\) correctly counts the number of ways to assign seats and entrances without conflicts.
   - The use of modular inverse (`pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD)`) ensures the division operation is handled correctly under modulo arithmetic.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1(n)` computes \(n!\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
  - This is implemented correctly as it iterates from 2 to \(n\) and multiplies each number by the running total, taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function `func_2(n, m)` uses the results from `func_1` to compute the total number of valid boarding sequences.
  - The computation \(\text{ways} = 2^m \cdot \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) involves the modular inverse of \((n - m)!\) to perform the division.
  - The modular inverse is computed using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any integer \(a\) and prime \(p\), \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p\). Hence, the modular inverse of \(a\) modulo \(p\) is \(a^{p-2} \mod p\).
  - The expression `pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD)` correctly computes the modular inverse of \((n - m)!\).

- **Potential Issues**:
  - The issue lies in the assumption that \((n - m)!\) is non-zero modulo \(10^9 + 7\). For \(1 \leq m < n \leq 1,000,000\), \((n - m)!\) is always non-zero and within the range of valid factorials.
  - However, the primary concern is the large size of \(n\) and \(m\). Calculating factorials directly for such large numbers can lead to overflow issues, even though the modulus operation helps mitigate this.
  - The key issue is not in the logic but in the handling of extremely large intermediate values during the multiplication and division steps, which could still lead to incorrect results due to potential overflow in the multiplication of large numbers.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the logical approach and the mathematical formulas used, but it does not address the potential overflow issues in the calculation of large factorials. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program might still fail for very large inputs due to the complexity and potential overflow in the multiplication and division operations.

**Final: False**

The program is theoretically correct but may not handle very large inputs correctly due to potential overflow issues in the calculation of large factorials.
