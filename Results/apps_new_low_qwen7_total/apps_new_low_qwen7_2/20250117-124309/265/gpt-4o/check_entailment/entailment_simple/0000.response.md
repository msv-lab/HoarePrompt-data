### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The factorial calculation is done correctly using a loop that multiplies each integer from 2 to `n` and takes modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow.
   - The final result is returned as \((2 \times 3 \times \ldots \times n) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane without anyone getting angry.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to compute factorials.
   - The formula used in `func_2` is derived from combinatorial mathematics:
     - \(2^m\) represents the number of ways to choose whether each person enters through the front or back entrance.
     - \( \text{fact}_n \) is the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - \( \text{fact}_{n-m} \) is the factorial of \(n - m\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - The term \( (\text{fact}_{n-m})^{-(10^9+6)} \) (which is equivalent to \( \text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \)) is computed using modular inverse.
   - The expression \(2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times \text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) correctly computes the number of valid seating arrangements and boarding sequences.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.
   - The input reading and splitting logic is correct, and the use of `sys.stdin.read` ensures efficient handling of large inputs.

Given the above analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem statement. All mathematical operations and logical steps are appropriately handled within the constraints.

### Correctness: **True**
