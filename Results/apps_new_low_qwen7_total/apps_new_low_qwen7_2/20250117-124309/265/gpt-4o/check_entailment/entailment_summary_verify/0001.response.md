### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves assigning seats and entrances to passengers in such a way that no passenger ends up in a seat where they cannot sit because it is occupied.
   - Each passenger can choose between two entrances, and they will walk directly to their assigned seat or continue walking until they find an empty seat.
   - The goal is to count the number of valid ways to do this, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analysis of Given Functions**:
   - `func_1(n)` correctly computes the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `func_2(n, m)` uses the results from `func_1` to compute the total number of valid boarding sequences:
     - `fact_n` is the factorial of `n`.
     - `fact_n_m` is the factorial of `n - m`.
     - The formula used is \(\text{ways} = 2^m \cdot \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula \(2^m \cdot \frac{n!}{(n - m)!}\) correctly counts the number of ways to assign seats and entrances without conflicts. Hereâ€™s why:
     - \(2^m\) accounts for the two choices (front or back) each of the `m` passengers can make.
     - \(\frac{n!}{(n - m)!}\) represents the number of ways to choose `m` seats out of `n` and arrange them, ensuring no conflicts arise as passengers will take the first available seat in their chosen direction.
   - The use of modular inverse (`pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD)`) ensures the division operation is handled correctly under modulo arithmetic, making the formula valid.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `m` equals `n`, \(\text{fact}_{n-m} = \text{fact}_0 = 1\), which correctly simplifies the formula to \(2^n\).
   - When `m` is 1, the formula simplifies to \(2 \cdot n!\), which is also correct.

5. **Overall Structure**:
   - The functions are well-structured and follow the problem requirements accurately.
   - The code correctly handles large numbers through modular arithmetic, ensuring no overflow issues.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
