### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summaries step-by-step to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ways to assign seats and boarding entrances such that no passenger gets stuck at the end of the row without finding a seat.
   - Each passenger can independently choose either the front or back entrance.
   - If a passenger finds their seat occupied, they will take the next available seat in the direction they entered.

2. **Function Summaries**:
   - `func_1(n)` computes the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `func_2(n, m)` uses the factorial results from `func_1` to compute the number of valid boarding sequences using the formula \(2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The formula \(2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) is used to calculate the number of valid ways.
   - Here, \(2^m\) accounts for the \(2^m\) choices (each passenger can choose either front or back).
   - \(\text{fact}_n\) is the factorial of `n`, representing the total number of permutations of `n` seats.
   - \(\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1}\) is the modular inverse of \(\text{fact}_{n-m}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), ensuring that the division is done correctly under modular arithmetic.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach correctly leverages the combinatorial properties of the problem.
   - By considering the factorial of `n` and `n-m`, and using the modular inverse, the formula accurately counts the valid seating arrangements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `m = n`, the formula correctly simplifies to \((2^n \times 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - When `m = 1`, the formula simplifies to \((2 \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-1}^{-1})) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of valid ways to assign seats and boarding entrances. The function summaries accurately describe the intended computation.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided function summaries.
