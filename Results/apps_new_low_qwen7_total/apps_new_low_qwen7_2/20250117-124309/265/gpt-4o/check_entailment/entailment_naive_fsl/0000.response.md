Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of ways passengers can board the plane without getting angry. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that each passenger can choose either the front or back entrance independently, and it needs to consider all possible combinations of entrances chosen by the passengers.

The program defines `func_1` to compute the factorial of a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\), and `func_2` to compute a value using factorials and modular exponentiation. However, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The calculation `pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD` does not accurately represent the number of valid boarding sequences.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to consider the following:

1. Each of the \(m\) passengers can independently choose between the front and back entrances.
2. For each passenger, the number of ways to assign seats such that no one gets angry depends on the distribution of passengers across the front and back entrances.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of valid ways to distribute passengers across the front and back entrances such that no one gets stuck at the end of the row. This involves combinatorial counting and careful consideration of the constraints.

Since the provided program does not correctly handle these aspects, it fails to meet the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
