Precondition: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7.** 

The function `func_1` is assumed to be a helper function that calculates the factorial of its argument, and `pow(x, y, z)` is used to compute \(x^y \mod z\). The variables `fact_n` and `fact_n_m` are the factorials of `n` and `n-m`, respectively, and `ways` is calculated based on these values, with the final result returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
