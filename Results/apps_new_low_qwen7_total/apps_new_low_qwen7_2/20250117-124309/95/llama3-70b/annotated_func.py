#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and k is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, where each digit is an integer strictly less than n and k does not contain leading zeros.
def func():
    n = int(input())

k = input()

x = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
        x += int(c) * n ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, `x` is the sum of the integer values of each character of the reversed string `k` multiplied by \(n\) raised to the power of their respective positions (where the rightmost character is considered position 0), `i` is the length of the string `k` minus one, `c` is the character at the position `i` of the reversed string `k`.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `k`. For each iteration, it updates `x` by adding the integer value of the current character (`c`) multiplied by `n` raised to the power of its index (`i`).
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
    #   - `x` accumulates the value of the number represented by the string `k` in base `n`.
    #   - `i` is incremented in each iteration, starting from the last index of the reversed string `k` (which is 0 for the rightmost character).
    #   - `c` changes to the next character in the reversed string `k` with each iteration.
    #   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop.
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: After all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the string `k` minus one because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of the string. At this point, `x` will hold the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the number represented by `k` in base `n`.
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: The relationship derived from the loop is consistent with the described iterations and the final output state. Each character of `k` contributes to `x` based on its position and the value of `n`, as specified by the loop logic.
    #
    #Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the final output state is:
    #Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, `x` is the integer value of the number represented by `k` in base `n`, `i` is the length of the string `k` minus one, `c` is the character at the position `i` of the reversed string `k`.
    print(x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function converts a number represented as a string `k` in a given base `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)) into its decimal (base 10) equivalent and prints the result. The function reads `n` and `k` from standard input, where `k` is a non-empty string with no more than 60 digits and no leading zeros. The function handles the conversion by iterating over each character in the reversed string `k`, converting it to its integer value, and multiplying it by \(n\) raised to the power of its position. The final result, `x`, is the decimal representation of the number.
