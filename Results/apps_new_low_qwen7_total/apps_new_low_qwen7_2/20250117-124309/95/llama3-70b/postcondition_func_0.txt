The function converts a number represented as a string `k` in a given base `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)) into its decimal (base 10) equivalent and prints the result. The function reads `n` and `k` from standard input, where `k` is a non-empty string with no more than 60 digits and no leading zeros. The function handles the conversion by iterating over each character in the reversed string `k`, converting it to its integer value, and multiplying it by \(n\) raised to the power of its position. The final result, `x`, is the decimal representation of the number.
