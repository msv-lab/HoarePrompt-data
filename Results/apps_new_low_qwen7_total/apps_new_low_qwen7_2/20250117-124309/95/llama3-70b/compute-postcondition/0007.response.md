Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, `x` is the sum of the integer values of each character of the reversed string `k` multiplied by \(n\) raised to the power of their respective positions (where the rightmost character is considered position 0), `i` is the length of the string `k` minus one, `c` is the character at the position `i` of the reversed string `k`.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `k`. For each iteration, it updates `x` by adding the integer value of the current character (`c`) multiplied by `n` raised to the power of its index (`i`).
2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
   - `x` accumulates the value of the number represented by the string `k` in base `n`.
   - `i` is incremented in each iteration, starting from the last index of the reversed string `k` (which is 0 for the rightmost character).
   - `c` changes to the next character in the reversed string `k` with each iteration.
   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop.
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: After all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the string `k` minus one because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of the string. At this point, `x` will hold the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the number represented by `k` in base `n`.
4. **Verify Relationships**: The relationship derived from the loop is consistent with the described iterations and the final output state. Each character of `k` contributes to `x` based on its position and the value of `n`, as specified by the loop logic.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the final output state is:
Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, `x` is the integer value of the number represented by `k` in base `n`, `i` is the length of the string `k` minus one, `c` is the character at the position `i` of the reversed string `k`.
