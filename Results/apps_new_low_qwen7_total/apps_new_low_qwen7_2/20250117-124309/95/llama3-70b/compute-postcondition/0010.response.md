Functionality: **The function converts a number represented as a string `k` in a given base `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)) into its decimal (base 10) equivalent and prints the result. The function reads `n` and `k` from standard input, where `k` is a non-empty string with no more than 60 digits and no leading zeros. The function handles the conversion by iterating over each character in the reversed string `k`, converting it to its integer value, and multiplying it by \(n\) raised to the power of its position. The final result, `x`, is the decimal representation of the number.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `n` is 2, the maximum possible value for `k` is \(2^{60} - 1\), which is a very large number.
- If `k` contains characters that are not valid digits in base `n` (i.e., characters greater than or equal to `n`), the function does not handle this case and will raise a `ValueError` when converting `c` to an integer.

Missing Functionality:
- The function does not validate whether `k` is a valid number in base `n`. It assumes that `k` is correctly formatted without leading zeros and that all characters in `k` are valid digits in base `n`.
