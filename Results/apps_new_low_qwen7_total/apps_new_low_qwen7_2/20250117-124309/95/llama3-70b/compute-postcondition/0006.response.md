In the given code snippet, `x` is incremented by the integer value of the character `c` (which is the third character of the reversed string `k`) multiplied by `n` raised to the power of `i`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is currently 2.
- `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`.
- The loop ensures `i` is within the bounds of the reversed string `k`, meaning `k` must have at least 3 characters for the loop to continue.

For the next iteration, `i` is incremented to 3, and `c` is now the third character of the reversed string `k`. The value of `x` is updated according to the formula `x += int(c) * n ** i`.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `i` is updated to 3.
- `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`.
- `x` is updated by adding `int(c) * n ** 3` to its current value.

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 3, `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`, and `x` is the original value of `x` plus the integer value of the third character of the reversed string `k` times `n` raised to the power of 3.**
