The code updates the value of `x` by adding the integer value of the second character of the reversed string `k` multiplied by `n` raised to the power of `i`. Initially, `i` is 1. The value of `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`.

To calculate the new value of `x`:
1. Reverse the string `k`.
2. Get the second character from the reversed string, which is `c`.
3. Convert `c` to its integer value.
4. Multiply this integer value by `n` (which is an integer between 2 and \(10^9\)) raised to the power of `i` (which is 1).

Therefore, the new value of `x` is the original value of `x` plus the integer value of `c` times `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, `x` is the original value of `x` plus the integer value of the second character of the reversed string `k` times `n`, `i` is 2, `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`**
