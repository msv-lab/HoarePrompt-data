Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the head are `i` and `c`.
   - `i` is the index of the current character in the reversed string `k`.
   - `c` is the character at the current index `i` in the reversed string `k`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
   - `k` is a non-empty string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits.
   - `x` is updated by adding the integer value of `c` to it.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `c` is the first character of the reversed string `k`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the reversed string `k` to process.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `c` is the first character of the reversed string `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 (`i = 1`), and `c` should be the second character of the reversed string `k`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` should be 1.
- `c` should be the second character of the reversed string `k`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not depend on the loop's progression.

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, `x` is `x + int(c)`, `i` is 1, `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`**
