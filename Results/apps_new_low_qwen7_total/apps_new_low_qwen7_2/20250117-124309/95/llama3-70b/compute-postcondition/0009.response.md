The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `k`, which is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, where each digit is an integer strictly less than n and `k` does not contain leading zeros. The function returns a value based on the input parameters. 

However, since the specific output or return value is not detailed in the provided information, we cannot specify what exactly the function returns without additional context.
