Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head objects**: The loop head contains the following objects: `i` and `c`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the bounds of the reversed string `k`. Since `i` starts from 2, it means there must be at least 2 characters in the reversed string `k` for the loop to start.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - `c` should be the third character of the reversed string `k`.

5. **Ensure the constraints are met**: The string `k` must have at least 3 characters to allow the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, `x` is the original value of `x` plus the integer value of the second character of the reversed string `k` times `n`, `i` is 3, `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`**
