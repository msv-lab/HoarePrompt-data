The given code block reads two inputs: the integer `n` and the string `k`. It then initializes `x` to 0. The string `k` represents a number in a base-n numeral system. The code does not perform any operations to compute or modify the values of `n` or `k`, and it does not define or modify the value of `x` further after setting it to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)
- `k` is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, where each digit is an integer strictly less than n and `k` does not contain leading zeros.
- `x` is initialized to 0.

After running the code block, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `x` remains 0.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, k is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, x is 0**
