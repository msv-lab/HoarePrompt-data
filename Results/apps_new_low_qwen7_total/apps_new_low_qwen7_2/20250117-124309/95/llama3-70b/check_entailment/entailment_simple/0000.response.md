Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the string `k` from standard input.
2. The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `k`. For each character, it calculates its positional value based on the current index and multiplies it by `n` raised to the power of that index, accumulating the result in `x`.
3. Since the loop processes each character of the string `k` in reverse order and correctly computes the positional value of each digit, the final value of `x` is the correct decimal representation of the number `k` in base `n`.
4. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code that would lead to incorrect results.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the code accurately converts a number from a given base `n` numeral system to its decimal representation.

Correctness: **True**
