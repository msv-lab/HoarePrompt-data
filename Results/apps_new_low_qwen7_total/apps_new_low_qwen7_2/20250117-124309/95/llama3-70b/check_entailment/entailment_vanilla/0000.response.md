### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires converting a given number `k` (which is a string representing a number in an arbitrary base `n`) back to its decimal representation.
   - The algorithm should correctly handle each digit of `k`, considering the positional value of each digit in the base `n` system.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function reads the base `n` and the string `k`.
   - It initializes `x` to 0, which will hold the decimal equivalent of `k`.
   - It uses a loop to iterate over the reversed string `k`, converting each character to an integer and multiplying it by `n` raised to the power of its position index (reversed order).

3. **Loop and Calculation**:
   - For each character `c` at position `i` in the reversed string `k`:
     - `int(c)` converts the character back to its integer value.
     - `n ** i` computes the positional value.
     - `int(c) * n ** i` adds the contribution of this digit to the total decimal value `x`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles all digits correctly as long as they are valid and strictly less than `n`.
   - The use of `enumerate(reversed(k))` ensures that each digit is processed in reverse order, correctly accounting for the positional values.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `x` is printed, which is the decimal representation of the number `k` in base `n`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code accurately implements the required functionality and handles all valid inputs within the constraints provided.
