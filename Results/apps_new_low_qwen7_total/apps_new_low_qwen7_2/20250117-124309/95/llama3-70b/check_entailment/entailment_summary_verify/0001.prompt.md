You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alexander is learning how to convert numbers from the decimal system to any other, however, he doesn't know English letters, so he writes any number only as a decimal number, it means that instead of the letter A he will write the number 10. Thus, by converting the number 475 from decimal to hexadecimal system, he gets 11311 (475 = 1·16^2 + 13·16^1 + 11·16^0). Alexander lived calmly until he tried to convert the number back to the decimal number system.

Alexander remembers that he worked with little numbers so he asks to find the minimum decimal number so that by converting it to the system with the base n he will get the number k.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The second line contains the integer k (0 ≤ k < 10^60), it is guaranteed that the number k contains no more than 60 symbols. All digits in the second line are strictly less than n.

Alexander guarantees that the answer exists and does not exceed 10^18.

The number k doesn't contain leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print the number x (0 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the answer to the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
12

Output
12
Input

11311

Output

2016

Output
594


-----Note-----

In the first example 12 could be obtained by converting two numbers to the system with base 13: 12 = 12·13^0 or 15 = 1·13^1 + 2·13^0.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    k = input()
    x = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
        x += int(c) * n ** i
    print(x)



- Function Summary: 
The function converts a number represented as a string `k` in a given base `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)) into its decimal (base 10) equivalent and prints the result. The function reads `n` and `k` from standard input, where `k` is a non-empty string with no more than 60 digits and no leading zeros. The function handles the conversion by iterating over each character in the reversed string `k`, converting it to its integer value, and multiplying it by \(n\) raised to the power of its position. The final result, `x`, is the decimal representation of the number.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires converting a given number `k` (which is a string representing a number in an arbitrary base `n`) back to its decimal representation.
   - The algorithm should correctly handle each digit of `k`, considering the positional value of each digit in the base `n` system.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function reads the base `n` and the string `k`.
   - It initializes `x` to 0, which will hold the decimal equivalent of `k`.
   - It uses a loop to iterate over the reversed string `k`, converting each character to an integer and multiplying it by `n` raised to the power of its position index (reversed order).

3. **Loop and Calculation**:
   - For each character `c` at position `i` in the reversed string `k`:
     - `int(c)` converts the character back to its integer value.
     - `n ** i` computes the positional value.
     - `int(c) * n ** i` adds the contribution of this digit to the total decimal value `x`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles all digits correctly as long as they are valid and strictly less than `n`.
   - The use of `enumerate(reversed(k))` ensures that each digit is processed in reverse order, correctly accounting for the positional values.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `x` is printed, which is the decimal representation of the number `k` in base `n`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code accurately implements the required functionality and handles all valid inputs within the constraints provided.
