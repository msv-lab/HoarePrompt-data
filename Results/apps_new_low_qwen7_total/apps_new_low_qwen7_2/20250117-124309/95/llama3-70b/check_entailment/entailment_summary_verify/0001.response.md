### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires converting a given number `k` (represented as a string in an arbitrary base `n`) back to its decimal representation. This is different from the original problem statement, which asks for the minimum decimal number that, when converted to the base `n`, results in `k`. However, the provided function seems to perform the reverse operation, i.e., converting from base `n` to decimal.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the base `n` and the string `k`.
   - It initializes `x` to 0, which will hold the decimal equivalent of `k`.
   - It iterates over the reversed string `k`, converting each character to its integer value and multiplying it by `n` raised to the power of its position index (reversed order).

3. **Loop and Calculation**:
   - For each character `c` at position `i` in the reversed string `k`:
     - `int(c)` converts the character back to its integer value.
     - `n ** i` computes the positional value.
     - `int(c) * n ** i` adds the contribution of this digit to the total decimal value `x`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles all digits correctly as long as they are valid and strictly less than `n`.
   - The use of `enumerate(reversed(k))` ensures that each digit is processed in reverse order, correctly accounting for the positional values.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `x` is printed, which is the decimal representation of the number `k` in base `n`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function correctly converts a number from base `n` to decimal, but the problem statement asks for the reverse process. Therefore, the function does not solve the intended problem.

### Correctness:
Since the provided function does not solve the intended problem, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final:
False
