### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves converting a string `k` representing a number in an arbitrary base `n` back to its decimal (base 10) equivalent.
   - The string `k` is guaranteed to have no more than 60 digits and no leading zeros, and each digit is strictly less than `n`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the base `n` and the string `k` from the input.
   - It initializes `x` to 0, which will accumulate the decimal value of `k`.
   - The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `k`, converting it to an integer and multiplying it by `n` raised to the power of its position index.

3. **Loop and Calculation**:
   - For each character `c` at position `i` in the reversed string `k`:
     - `int(c)` converts the character back to its integer value.
     - `n ** i` computes the positional value.
     - `int(c) * n ** i` correctly adds the contribution of this digit to the total decimal value `x`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles all valid digits correctly as long as they are strictly less than `n`.
   - The use of `enumerate(reversed(k))` ensures that each digit is processed in reverse order, correctly accounting for the positional values.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `x` is printed, which is the decimal representation of the number `k` in base `n`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code accurately implements the required functionality and handles all valid inputs within the constraints provided.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly converts a number from an arbitrary base `n` to its decimal representation. The code logic is sound, and it properly handles the positional values and ensures that all valid inputs are processed correctly.

Final: **True**
