You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alexander is learning how to convert numbers from the decimal system to any other, however, he doesn't know English letters, so he writes any number only as a decimal number, it means that instead of the letter A he will write the number 10. Thus, by converting the number 475 from decimal to hexadecimal system, he gets 11311 (475 = 1·16^2 + 13·16^1 + 11·16^0). Alexander lived calmly until he tried to convert the number back to the decimal number system.

Alexander remembers that he worked with little numbers so he asks to find the minimum decimal number so that by converting it to the system with the base n he will get the number k.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The second line contains the integer k (0 ≤ k < 10^60), it is guaranteed that the number k contains no more than 60 symbols. All digits in the second line are strictly less than n.

Alexander guarantees that the answer exists and does not exceed 10^18.

The number k doesn't contain leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print the number x (0 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the answer to the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
12

Output
12
Input
16
11311

Output
475
Input
20
999

Output
3789
Input

2016

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example 12 could be obtained by converting two numbers to the system with base 13: 12 = 12·13^0 or 15 = 1·13^1 + 2·13^0.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    k = input()
    x = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
        x += int(c) * n ** i
    print(x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and k is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, where each digit is an integer strictly less than n and k does not contain leading zeros.
def func():
    n = int(input())

k = input()

x = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
        x += int(c) * n ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, `x` is the sum of the integer values of each character of the reversed string `k` multiplied by \(n\) raised to the power of their respective positions (where the rightmost character is considered position 0), `i` is the length of the string `k` minus one, `c` is the character at the position `i` of the reversed string `k`.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `k`. For each iteration, it updates `x` by adding the integer value of the current character (`c`) multiplied by `n` raised to the power of its index (`i`).
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
    #   - `x` accumulates the value of the number represented by the string `k` in base `n`.
    #   - `i` is incremented in each iteration, starting from the last index of the reversed string `k` (which is 0 for the rightmost character).
    #   - `c` changes to the next character in the reversed string `k` with each iteration.
    #   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop.
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: After all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the string `k` minus one because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of the string. At this point, `x` will hold the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the number represented by `k` in base `n`.
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: The relationship derived from the loop is consistent with the described iterations and the final output state. Each character of `k` contributes to `x` based on its position and the value of `n`, as specified by the loop logic.
    #
    #Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the final output state is:
    #Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, `x` is the integer value of the number represented by `k` in base `n`, `i` is the length of the string `k` minus one, `c` is the character at the position `i` of the reversed string `k`.
    print(x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function converts a number represented as a string `k` in a given base `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)) into its decimal (base 10) equivalent and prints the result. The function reads `n` and `k` from standard input, where `k` is a non-empty string with no more than 60 digits and no leading zeros. The function handles the conversion by iterating over each character in the reversed string `k`, converting it to its integer value, and multiplying it by \(n\) raised to the power of its position. The final result, `x`, is the decimal representation of the number.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires converting a given number `k` (which is a string representing a number in an arbitrary base `n`) back to its decimal representation.
   - The algorithm should correctly handle each digit of `k`, considering the positional value of each digit in the base `n` system.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function reads the base `n` and the string `k`.
   - It initializes `x` to 0, which will hold the decimal equivalent of `k`.
   - It uses a loop to iterate over the reversed string `k`, converting each character to an integer and multiplying it by `n` raised to the power of its position index (reversed order).

3. **Loop and Calculation**:
   - For each character `c` at position `i` in the reversed string `k`:
     - `int(c)` converts the character back to its integer value.
     - `n ** i` computes the positional value.
     - `int(c) * n ** i` adds the contribution of this digit to the total decimal value `x`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles all digits correctly as long as they are valid and strictly less than `n`.
   - The use of `enumerate(reversed(k))` ensures that each digit is processed in reverse order, correctly accounting for the positional values.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `x` is printed, which is the decimal representation of the number `k` in base `n`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code accurately implements the required functionality and handles all valid inputs within the constraints provided.
