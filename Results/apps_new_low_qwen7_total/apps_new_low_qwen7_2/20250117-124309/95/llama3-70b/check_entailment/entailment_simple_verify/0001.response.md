### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires converting a given number `k` (which is a string representing a number in an arbitrary base `n`) back to its decimal representation.
   - The algorithm should correctly handle each digit of `k`, considering the positional value of each digit in the base `n` system.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function reads the base `n` and the string `k`.
   - It initializes `x` to 0, which will hold the decimal equivalent of `k`.
   - It uses a loop to iterate over the reversed string `k`, converting each character to an integer and multiplying it by `n` raised to the power of its position index (reversed order).

3. **Loop and Calculation**:
   - For each character `c` at position `i` in the reversed string `k`:
     - `int(c)` converts the character back to its integer value.
     - `n ** i` computes the positional value.
     - `int(c) * n ** i` adds the contribution of this digit to the total decimal value `x`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles all digits correctly as long as they are valid and strictly less than `n`.
   - The use of `enumerate(reversed(k))` ensures that each digit is processed in reverse order, correctly accounting for the positional values.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `x` is printed, which is the decimal representation of the number `k` in base `n`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code accurately implements the required functionality and handles all valid inputs within the constraints provided.

However, there is a subtle issue in the original assessment. The original assessment did not explicitly mention the potential issues with leading zeros in the input string `k`. While the problem statement guarantees that `k` does not have leading zeros, the implementation assumes that `k` is always a valid string without leading zeros. This might not cover all edge cases, especially if the input handling is not robust enough to handle strings with leading zeros.

For instance, if `k` were "0" (which is a valid input since it has no leading zeros but is still within the constraints), the program would treat it as `n**0`, resulting in `x = 0`, which is technically correct but might not be the intended behavior if the input is expected to be handled specially.

### Final Evaluation:
- Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is mostly correct but could benefit from mentioning the handling of strings with leading zeros.
- Since the problem guarantees that the input does not have leading zeros, the current implementation should work correctly under these conditions.

**Final: True**
