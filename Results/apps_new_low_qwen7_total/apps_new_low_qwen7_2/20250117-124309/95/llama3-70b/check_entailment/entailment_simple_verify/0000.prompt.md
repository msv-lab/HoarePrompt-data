You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alexander is learning how to convert numbers from the decimal system to any other, however, he doesn't know English letters, so he writes any number only as a decimal number, it means that instead of the letter A he will write the number 10. Thus, by converting the number 475 from decimal to hexadecimal system, he gets 11311 (475 = 1·16^2 + 13·16^1 + 11·16^0). Alexander lived calmly until he tried to convert the number back to the decimal number system.

Alexander remembers that he worked with little numbers so he asks to find the minimum decimal number so that by converting it to the system with the base n he will get the number k.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The second line contains the integer k (0 ≤ k < 10^60), it is guaranteed that the number k contains no more than 60 symbols. All digits in the second line are strictly less than n.

Alexander guarantees that the answer exists and does not exceed 10^18.

The number k doesn't contain leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print the number x (0 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the answer to the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
12

Output
12
Input
16
11311

Output
475
Input
20
999

Output
3789
Input
17
2016

Output
594


-----Note-----

In the first example 12 could be obtained by converting two numbers to the system with base 13: 12 = 12·13^0 or 15 = 1·13^1 + 2·13^0.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    k = input()
    x = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
        x += int(c) * n ** i
    print(x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and k is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, where each digit is an integer strictly less than n and k does not contain leading zeros.
def func():
    n = int(input())

k = input()

x = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
        x += int(c) * n ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, `x` is the sum of the integer values of each character of the reversed string `k` multiplied by \(n\) raised to the power of their respective positions (where the rightmost character is considered position 0), `i` is the length of the string `k` minus one, `c` is the character at the position `i` of the reversed string `k`.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `k`. For each iteration, it updates `x` by adding the integer value of the current character (`c`) multiplied by `n` raised to the power of its index (`i`).
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
    #   - `x` accumulates the value of the number represented by the string `k` in base `n`.
    #   - `i` is incremented in each iteration, starting from the last index of the reversed string `k` (which is 0 for the rightmost character).
    #   - `c` changes to the next character in the reversed string `k` with each iteration.
    #   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop.
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: After all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the string `k` minus one because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of the string. At this point, `x` will hold the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the number represented by `k` in base `n`.
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: The relationship derived from the loop is consistent with the described iterations and the final output state. Each character of `k` contributes to `x` based on its position and the value of `n`, as specified by the loop logic.
    #
    #Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the final output state is:
    #Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, `x` is the integer value of the number represented by `k` in base `n`, `i` is the length of the string `k` minus one, `c` is the character at the position `i` of the reversed string `k`.
    print(x)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to convert a number from a given base `n` back to its decimal representation. The program iterates over each digit of the input string `k` in reverse order, converting each digit to an integer and multiplying it by `n` raised to the power of its position index. This approach ensures that all possible cases are handled correctly, as long as the input number `k` is valid and the base `n` is within the specified range. Since the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all given examples correctly, it can be considered correct.
