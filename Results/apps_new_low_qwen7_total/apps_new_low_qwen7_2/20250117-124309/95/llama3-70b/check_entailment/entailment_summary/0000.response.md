Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to convert a number represented in an arbitrary base `n` (given as a string) to its decimal (base 10) equivalent. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of why this is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the base `n` and the number `k` as strings from the standard input.
2. **String Reversal and Iteration**: The program iterates over each character in the reversed string `k`. This ensures that each digit is processed starting from the least significant digit (rightmost).
3. **Character to Integer Conversion**: For each character in the reversed string, the program converts it to its integer value using `int(c)`.
4. **Power Calculation**: The integer value of each character is multiplied by \(n\) raised to the power of its position (index). Since the loop uses `enumerate(reversed(k))`, the index starts from 0, which correctly represents the position from the right.
5. **Summation**: The results of these multiplications are summed up to form the final decimal representation `x`.
6. **Output**: The final decimal value `x` is printed.

Given the constraints and the provided problem statement, the program correctly performs the conversion as specified. There are no logical errors in the code provided.

Correctness: **True**
