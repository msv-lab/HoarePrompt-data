Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to convert a number from a given base `n` back to its decimal representation. The program iterates over each digit of the input string `k` in reverse order, converting each digit to an integer and multiplying it by `n` raised to the power of its position index. This approach ensures that all possible cases are handled correctly, as long as the input number `k` is valid and the base `n` is within the specified range. Since the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all given examples correctly, it can be considered correct.
