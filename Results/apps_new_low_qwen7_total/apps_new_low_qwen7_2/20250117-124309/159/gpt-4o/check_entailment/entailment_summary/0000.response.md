Reasoning:
1. The problem requires dividing \(2n\) chess players into two teams of \(n\) players each such that the team of BerOil (first team) always wins against the team of BerMobile (second team) in any randomly formed pair.
2. The provided program correctly follows this logic:
   - It reads the number of players \(n\) and their ratings.
   - It sorts the ratings.
   - It divides the sorted ratings into two teams (`team1` and `team2`).
   - It then checks if every player in `team1` has a rating strictly less than every corresponding player in `team2`.
3. If this condition is met, the program correctly prints "YES", indicating that such a division is possible.
4. If the condition is not met, the program correctly prints "NO".

Given the execution summary and the provided examples, the program seems to correctly implement the required functionality. The examples provided also align with the expected output based on the logic implemented in the code.

Correctness: **True**
