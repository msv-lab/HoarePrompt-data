Reasoning:
1. The goal is to ensure that the team formed from the top n ratings (Team 1) always wins against the team formed from the bottom n ratings (Team 2) in every possible pairing.
2. The provided solution sorts the ratings and then checks if the first half (Team 1) is strictly less than the second half (Team 2).
3. Sorting the ratings ensures that the highest n ratings are in Team 1 and the lowest n ratings are in Team 2.
4. Checking if each element in Team 1 is less than the corresponding element in Team 2 ensures that no matter how the drawing pairs the players, the player from Team 1 will always have a higher or equal rating to the player from Team 2, thus ensuring a win for Team 1.

Given this analysis, the logic implemented in the code correctly addresses the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
