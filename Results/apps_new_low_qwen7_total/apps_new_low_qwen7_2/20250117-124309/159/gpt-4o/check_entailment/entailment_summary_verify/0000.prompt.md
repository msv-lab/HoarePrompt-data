You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Berland annual chess tournament is coming!

Organizers have gathered 2·n chess players who should be divided into two teams with n people each. The first team is sponsored by BerOil and the second team is sponsored by BerMobile. Obviously, organizers should guarantee the win for the team of BerOil.

Thus, organizers should divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each in such a way that the first team always wins.

Every chess player has its rating r_{i}. It is known that chess player with the greater rating always wins the player with the lower rating. If their ratings are equal then any of the players can win.

After teams assignment there will come a drawing to form n pairs of opponents: in each pair there is a player from the first team and a player from the second team. Every chess player should be in exactly one pair. Every pair plays once. The drawing is totally random.

Is it possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_2n (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000).


-----Output-----

If it's possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing, then print "YES". Otherwise print "NO".


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 3 2 4

Output
YES

Input
1
3 3

Output
NO

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ratings.sort()
    team1 = ratings[:n]
    team2 = ratings[n:]
    possible = all((team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n)))
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func()` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(2 \cdot n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\). It sorts these integers into two teams (`team1` and `team2`) of size `n` each. The function then checks if every element in `team1` is strictly less than the corresponding element in `team2`. If this condition holds for all pairs, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the comparison of the two teams. Potential edge cases include when `n` is at the boundaries of its range (i.e., `n=1` or `n=100`). Additionally, if the input integers do not satisfy the constraints \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\), the function will still proceed with the sorting and comparison, which might lead to unexpected results if the annotations are not updated to reflect this behavior.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all players have the same rating. According to the problem description, if two players have the same rating, the outcome of the match is uncertain. However, the program assumes that for all players \(i\) in the first team, the corresponding player \(i+n\) in the second team will have a higher rating, which is not guaranteed if all players have the same rating.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
3 3 3 3
```

In this case, both teams would have players with the same rating, making it impossible to guarantee that the player from the first team will always win every match. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in this scenario.
