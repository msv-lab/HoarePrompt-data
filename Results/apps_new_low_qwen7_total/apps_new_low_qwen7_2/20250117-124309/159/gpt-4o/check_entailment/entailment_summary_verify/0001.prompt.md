You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Berland annual chess tournament is coming!

Organizers have gathered 2·n chess players who should be divided into two teams with n people each. The first team is sponsored by BerOil and the second team is sponsored by BerMobile. Obviously, organizers should guarantee the win for the team of BerOil.

Thus, organizers should divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each in such a way that the first team always wins.

Every chess player has its rating r_{i}. It is known that chess player with the greater rating always wins the player with the lower rating. If their ratings are equal then any of the players can win.

After teams assignment there will come a drawing to form n pairs of opponents: in each pair there is a player from the first team and a player from the second team. Every chess player should be in exactly one pair. Every pair plays once. The drawing is totally random.

Is it possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_2n (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000).


-----Output-----

If it's possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing, then print "YES". Otherwise print "NO".


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 3 2 4

Output
YES

Input
1
3 3

Output
NO

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ratings.sort()
    team1 = ratings[:n]
    team2 = ratings[n:]
    possible = all((team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n)))
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func()` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(2 \cdot n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\). It sorts these integers into two teams (`team1` and `team2`) of size `n` each. The function then checks if every element in `team1` is strictly less than the corresponding element in `team2`. If this condition holds for all pairs, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the comparison of the two teams. Potential edge cases include when `n` is at the boundaries of its range (i.e., `n=1` or `n=100`). Additionally, if the input integers do not satisfy the constraints \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\), the function will still proceed with the sorting and comparison, which might lead to unexpected results if the annotations are not updated to reflect this behavior.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to divide \(2n\) chess players into two teams of \(n\) players each.
   - Each team should be structured such that no matter how the pairs are randomly drawn, the player from the first team in each pair will always win because they have a higher rating than the corresponding player from the second team.
   - Players are rated, and a player with a higher rating always wins against a player with a lower rating.

2. **Approach of Provided Code**:
   - The code sorts the list of ratings.
   - It then divides the sorted ratings into two teams: `team1` and `team2`, where `team1` consists of the top \(n\) ratings and `team2` consists of the bottom \(n\) ratings.
   - It checks if the highest-rated player in `team1` is always higher than the highest-rated player in `team2`, the second-highest in `team1` is always higher than the second-highest in `team2`, and so on.
   - If all these conditions hold true, it means that any pairing between the two teams will ensure that the player from `team1` wins every time.

3. **Verification**:
   - For the example given in the problem:
     - Input: `2`
     - Ratings: `1 3 2 4`
     - After sorting: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
     - Team1: `[4, 3]`
     - Team2: `[2, 1]`
     - All conditions hold (`4 > 2` and `3 > 1`), so the output is "YES".

   - Another example:
     - Input: `1`
     - Ratings: `3 3`
     - After sorting: `[3, 3]`
     - Team1: `[3]`
     - Team2: `[3]`
     - There is no way to ensure one player always wins against the other in every pairing, so the output is "NO".

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the provided code is sound and correctly implements the necessary condition to ensure the first team always wins.

### Correctness:
- The provided program correctly solves the problem as described.
- Therefore, the answer is: **True**
