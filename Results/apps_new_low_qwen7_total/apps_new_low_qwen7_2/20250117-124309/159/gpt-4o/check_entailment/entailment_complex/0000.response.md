Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` correctly reads the input values for `n` and the ratings list.
2. It then sorts the ratings list.
3. The function divides the sorted list into two teams: `team1` and `team2`.
4. It checks if each element in `team1` is strictly less than the corresponding element in `team2`.
5. If all elements in `team1` are strictly less than their counterparts in `team2`, the function prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to form the teams such that the player from the first team in every pair wins.
6. If any element in `team1` is not strictly less than its counterpart in `team2`, the function prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to form such teams.
7. The logic is sound as long as the input ratings follow the given constraints (each rating between 1 and 1000 inclusive).

Given the problem statement and the provided example executions, the function logic is correct and follows the requirement to ensure that the player from the first team always wins in every pair regardless of the drawing.

Correctness: **True**
