### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires dividing \(2n\) chess players into two teams of \(n\) players each such that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the random pairing.

2. **Approach of Provided Code**:
   - The code sorts the list of ratings.
   - It then divides the sorted ratings into two teams: `team1` (top \(n\) ratings) and `team2` (bottom \(n\) ratings).
   - It checks if the highest-rated player in `team1` is always higher than the highest-rated player in `team2`, the second-highest in `team1` is always higher than the second-highest in `team2`, and so on.
   - This approach ensures that in every possible pairing, the player from `team1` will have a higher rating than the player from `team2`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic of sorting the ratings and dividing them into two teams based on their positions ensures that for any pairing, the player from `team1` will have a higher rating.
   - For the given examples:
     - Example 1: `2 1 3 2 4`
       - Sorted: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`
       - Team1: `[4, 3]`
       - Team2: `[2, 2, 1]`
       - All conditions hold (`4 > 2`, `3 > 2`, `2 > 1`), so the output is "YES".
     - Example 2: `1 1`
       - Sorted: `[1, 1]`
       - Team1: `[1]`
       - Team2: `[1]`
       - There is no way to ensure one player always wins against the other, so the output is "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where all players have the same rating (e.g., `1 1 1 1`). In this scenario, it still correctly identifies that no team can ensure a win in every pairing.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the provided code is sound and correctly implements the necessary condition to ensure the first team always wins.
   - The code accurately determines whether such a division is possible based on the sorted ratings.

### Correctness:
- The provided program correctly solves the problem as described.
- Therefore, the answer is: **True**

Final: **True**
