You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Berland annual chess tournament is coming!

Organizers have gathered 2·n chess players who should be divided into two teams with n people each. The first team is sponsored by BerOil and the second team is sponsored by BerMobile. Obviously, organizers should guarantee the win for the team of BerOil.

Thus, organizers should divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each in such a way that the first team always wins.

Every chess player has its rating r_{i}. It is known that chess player with the greater rating always wins the player with the lower rating. If their ratings are equal then any of the players can win.

After teams assignment there will come a drawing to form n pairs of opponents: in each pair there is a player from the first team and a player from the second team. Every chess player should be in exactly one pair. Every pair plays once. The drawing is totally random.

Is it possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_2n (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000).


-----Output-----

If it's possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing, then print "YES". Otherwise print "NO".


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 3 2 4

Output
YES

Input
1
3 3

Output
NO

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ratings.sort()
    team1 = ratings[:n]
    team2 = ratings[n:]
    possible = all((team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n)))
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())

ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))

ratings.sort()

team1 = ratings[:n]

team2 = ratings[n:]

possible = all(team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n))
    if possible :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ratings` is a sorted list of 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000, `team1` is the first n elements of the sorted `ratings` list, `team2` is the last n elements of the sorted `ratings` list, `possible` is a boolean indicating whether each element in `team1` is less than or equal to the corresponding element in `team2`. If `possible` is true, then `possible` remains true. If `possible` is false, the console prints 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all players have the same rating. According to the problem description, if two players have the same rating, the outcome of the match is uncertain. However, the program assumes that for all players \(i\) in the first team, the corresponding player \(i+n\) in the second team will have a higher rating, which is not guaranteed if all players have the same rating.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
3 3 3 3
```

In this case, both teams would have players with the same rating, making it impossible to guarantee that the player from the first team will always win every match. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in this scenario.
