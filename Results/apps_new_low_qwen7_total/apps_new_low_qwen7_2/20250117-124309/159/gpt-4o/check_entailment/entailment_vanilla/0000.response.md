### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to divide \(2n\) chess players into two teams of \(n\) players each.
   - Each team should be structured such that no matter how the pairs are randomly drawn, the player from the first team in each pair will always win because they have a higher rating than the corresponding player from the second team.
   - Players are rated, and a player with a higher rating always wins against a player with a lower rating.

2. **Approach of Provided Code**:
   - The code sorts the list of ratings.
   - It then divides the sorted ratings into two teams: `team1` and `team2`, where `team1` consists of the top \(n\) ratings and `team2` consists of the bottom \(n\) ratings.
   - It checks if the highest-rated player in `team1` is always higher than the highest-rated player in `team2`, the second-highest in `team1` is always higher than the second-highest in `team2`, and so on.
   - If all these conditions hold true, it means that any pairing between the two teams will ensure that the player from `team1` wins every time.

3. **Verification**:
   - For the example given in the problem:
     - Input: `2`
     - Ratings: `1 3 2 4`
     - After sorting: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
     - Team1: `[4, 3]`
     - Team2: `[2, 1]`
     - All conditions hold (`4 > 2` and `3 > 1`), so the output is "YES".

   - Another example:
     - Input: `1`
     - Ratings: `3 3`
     - After sorting: `[3, 3]`
     - Team1: `[3]`
     - Team2: `[3]`
     - There is no way to ensure one player always wins against the other in every pairing, so the output is "NO".

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the provided code is sound and correctly implements the necessary condition to ensure the first team always wins.

### Correctness:
- The provided program correctly solves the problem as described.
- Therefore, the answer is: **True**
