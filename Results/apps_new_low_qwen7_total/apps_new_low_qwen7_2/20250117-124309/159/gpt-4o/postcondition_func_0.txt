The function `func()` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(2 \cdot n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\). It sorts these integers into two teams (`team1` and `team2`) of size `n` each. The function then checks if every element in `team1` is strictly less than the corresponding element in `team2`. If this condition holds for all pairs, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the comparison of the two teams. Potential edge cases include when `n` is at the boundaries of its range (i.e., `n=1` or `n=100`). Additionally, if the input integers do not satisfy the constraints \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\), the function will still proceed with the sorting and comparison, which might lead to unexpected results if the annotations are not updated to reflect this behavior.
