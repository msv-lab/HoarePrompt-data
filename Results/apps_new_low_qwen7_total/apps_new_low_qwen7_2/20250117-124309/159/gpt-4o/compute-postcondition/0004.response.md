The code `print('NO')` does not affect the values of any variables. It only prints the string 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ratings` is a sorted list of 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000, `team1` is the first n elements of the sorted ratings list, `team2` is the last n elements of the sorted ratings list, `possible` is a boolean indicating whether each element in `team1` is less than or equal to the corresponding element in `team2`, and the console prints 'NO'**
