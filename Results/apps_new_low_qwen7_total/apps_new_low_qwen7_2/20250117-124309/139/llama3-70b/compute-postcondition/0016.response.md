First, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: 
  - `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4.
  - `a` is a non-negative integer.
  - `b` is a non-negative integer.
  - `c` is a non-negative integer.
  - `k` is 0.
  - `ans` is 0 or `3c - b - a`.
  - `i` is 2.
  - `j` is -3.

The code snippet is:
```python
ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
```

Now, let's evaluate each part of the expression in the code snippet:

1. `3 * i * c`:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `c` is a non-negative integer.
   - Therefore, `3 * i * c` is `3 * 2 * c = 6c`.

2. `j * b`:
   - `j` is -3.
   - `b` is a non-negative integer.
   - Therefore, `j * b` is `-3 * b`.

3. `(k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a`:
   - `k` is 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is -3.
   - Therefore, `k - 3 * i - 2 * j` is `0 - 3 * 2 - 2 * (-3) = 0 - 6 + 6 = 0`.
   - Thus, `(k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a` is `0 * a = 0`.

So, the expression simplifies to:
\[ 6c - 3b + 0 = 6c - 3b \]

Now, let's consider the assignment:
\[ ans = \min(ans, 6c - 3b) \]

Since `ans` is initially 0 or `3c - b - a`, and we need to compare this with `6c - 3b`, we need to evaluate which is smaller:

- If `ans` is 0, then `ans` will be updated to `6c - 3b` if `6c - 3b < 0`.
- If `ans` is `3c - b - a`, then `ans` will be updated to `6c - 3b` if `6c - 3b < 3c - b - a`.

Given that `6c - 3b` could potentially be smaller depending on the values of `c` and `b`, the value of `ans` will be updated to `6c - 3b` if it is smaller.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `ans` is now `6c - 3b`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `ans` is `6c - 3b`, `i` is 2, `j` is -3**
