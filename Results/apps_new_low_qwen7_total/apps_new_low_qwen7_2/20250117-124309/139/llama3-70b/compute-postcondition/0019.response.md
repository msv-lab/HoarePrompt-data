The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of the variable `ans`. Since no other operations are performed on the variables, the values of `ans`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is `6c - 3b`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `ans` is `6c - 3b`, `i` is 2, `j` is -3**
