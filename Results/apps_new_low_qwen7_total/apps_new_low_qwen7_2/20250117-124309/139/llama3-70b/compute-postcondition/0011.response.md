The initial state includes `n` being a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0.

The code snippet updates the variable `j` as follows:
```python
j = (k - 3 * i) // 2
```
Given the initial values:
- `k` is 0
- `i` is 1

Substitute these values into the equation:
```python
j = (0 - 3 * 1) // 2
j = (-3) // 2
j = -1  # Integer division rounds down, so -3 // 2 results in -1
```

Thus, `j` is updated to -1. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `k`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is -1**
