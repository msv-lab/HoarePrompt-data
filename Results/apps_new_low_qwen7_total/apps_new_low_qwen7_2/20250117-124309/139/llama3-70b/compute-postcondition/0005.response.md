Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4.
- `a` is a non-negative integer.
- `b` is a non-negative integer.
- `c` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is 0.
- `ans` is infinity.
- The for loop is: `for i in range(k // 3 + 1):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `range(k // 3 + 1)`.
   - Since `k` is given as 0, we substitute `k` into the expression:
     \[
     k // 3 + 1 = 0 // 3 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = 0`, meaning it will execute exactly once (with `i = 0`).

2. **Determining the Initial State for the Loop Head**:
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.
   - For the loop to execute, `k // 3 + 1` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `k` is 0, `k // 3 + 1` evaluates to 1, which is indeed greater than 0.
   - Hence, the loop will execute.

3. **Variables in the Loop Body**:
   - In the first iteration (`i = 0`), no new variables are introduced, but the initial values of `i` and `k` must satisfy the loop condition.
   - Specifically, `i` should be 0 when the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `i` should be 0.
- `k` should be 0.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `ans` is infinity, `i` is 0**
