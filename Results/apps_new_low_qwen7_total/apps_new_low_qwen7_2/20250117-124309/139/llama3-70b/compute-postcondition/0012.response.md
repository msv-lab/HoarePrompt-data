First, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is -1.

- Code Snippet: 
  ```python
  ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
  ```

We need to substitute the known values into the equation to determine the new value of `ans`.

Given the initial values:
- `i` is 1,
- `j` is -1,
- `k` is 0.

Substituting these values into the expression `3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a`:

\[
3 \times 1 \times c + (-1) \times b + (0 - 3 \times 1 - 2 \times (-1)) \times a
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
3c - b + (0 - 3 + 2) \times a = 3c - b - a
\]

So, the code updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of the expression `3c - b - a`.

Since `ans` is initially 0, the new value of `ans` will be:

- If `3c - b - a` is less than or equal to 0, `ans` remains 0.
- Otherwise, `ans` becomes `3c - b - a`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `ans` is 0 or `3c - b - a`, depending on the values of `c`, `b`, and `a`.
- All other variables remain unchanged: `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `k`, `i`, `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0 or `3c - b - a`, `i` is 1, `j` is -1**
