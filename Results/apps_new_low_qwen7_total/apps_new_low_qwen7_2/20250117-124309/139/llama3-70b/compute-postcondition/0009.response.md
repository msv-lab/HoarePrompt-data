Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If 3 * i + 2 * j <= k, then `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, no change in the variables' values since there is no else part provided.***
