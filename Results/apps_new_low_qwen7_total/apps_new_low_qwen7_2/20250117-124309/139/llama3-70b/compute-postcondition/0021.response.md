Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters and reads four integers \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from standard input. It then computes a value based on these inputs and prints the result. Specifically, it calculates the minimum cost to achieve a specific condition related to \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). If \( n \) is negative, it results in an error message, which is not possible given the problem constraints since \( n \) is defined to be a non-negative integer. The function first adjusts \( n \) to ensure it is a multiple of 4 by adding 4 if necessary. Then, it iterates through possible combinations of \( i \) and \( j \) to find the minimum cost, where the cost is calculated as \( 3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a \). The final output is the minimum cost found. If no valid combination of \( i \) and \( j \) is found, the minimum cost remains infinity, and this value is printed.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- The function assumes that the input values \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are non-negative integers, and it does not explicitly handle cases where these values might be zero. If any of these values are zero, the cost calculation would naturally adjust accordingly, potentially leading to a cost of zero if the conditions are met.

Missing Functionality:
- There is no handling for invalid input types (e.g., if the input is not four integers or if the integers are outside the specified range). The function should ideally validate the input to ensure it meets the expected criteria before proceeding with the calculations.
