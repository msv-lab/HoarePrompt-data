Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0. Since `k == 4` implies `k` is 0 in the if part, the overall postcondition matches the if part's postcondition.***
