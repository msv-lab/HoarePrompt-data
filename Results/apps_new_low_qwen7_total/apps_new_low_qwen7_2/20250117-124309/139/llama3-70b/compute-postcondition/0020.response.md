The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list `def func():`. Based on the given output cases, the function likely processes some internal state or input not shown in the provided code snippet.

Given the constraints, the function could be expected to process non-negative integers \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) within the range \( 1 \leq n, a, b, c \leq 10^9 \). However, since these are not passed as parameters, we infer the function's behavior from the provided output cases.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns an error message if any of the values (assumed to be \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), \( c \)) are negative, and otherwise processes these values to determine a result.**
