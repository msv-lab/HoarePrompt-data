Output State: **n is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, a is an non-negative integer, b is an non-negative integer, c is an non-negative integer, k is 4 minus n modulo 4**

Explanation: 
The first line of code takes four space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. However, since the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not used in the subsequent code, their values remain unchanged. 

The second line calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 4 (i.e., `n % 4`) and subtracts this value from 4 to assign the result to `k`. This means `k` will be 0 if `n` is already a multiple of 4, or it will be 4 minus the remainder otherwise. Thus, `k` is determined solely by the value of `n` after the modulo operation.
