Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0 or `3c - b - a`, `i` is 1, `j` is -1. If `3 * i + 2 * j <= k`, then `ans` is either 0 or `3c - b - a`. Since `i` and `j` do not change in the if or else part, their values remain `1` and `-1` respectively.***
