Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4.
   - `a` is a non-negative integer.
   - `b` is a non-negative integer.
   - `c` is a non-negative integer.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.

2. **Loop Head**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```
   for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
   ```

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `i` is less than `k // 3 + 1`.

4. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented from 0 to 1. This means `i` should become 1.

6. **Adjusting States**: We only need to adjust the value of `i` because it is the only variable in the loop head that changes the loop condition. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `k`, `ans`, `j`) remain unchanged as per the loop condition and the problem description.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**.
