You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little girl Alyona is in a shop to buy some copybooks for school. She study four subjects so she wants to have equal number of copybooks for each of the subjects. There are three types of copybook's packs in the shop: it is possible to buy one copybook for a rubles, a pack of two copybooks for b rubles, and a pack of three copybooks for c rubles. Alyona already has n copybooks.

What is the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4? There are infinitely many packs of any type in the shop. Alyona can buy packs of different type in the same purchase.


-----Input-----

The only line contains 4 integers n, a, b, c (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1 3 4

Output
3

Input
6 2 1 1

Output
1

Input
4 4 4 4

Output
0

Input
999999999 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

Output
1000000000



-----Note-----

In the first example Alyona can buy 3 packs of 1 copybook for 3a = 3 rubles in total. After that she will have 4 copybooks which she can split between the subjects equally. 

In the second example Alyuna can buy a pack of 2 copybooks for b = 1 ruble. She will have 8 copybooks in total.

In the third example Alyona can split the copybooks she already has between the 4 subject equally, so she doesn't need to buy anything.

In the fourth example Alyona should buy one pack of one copybook.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    k = 4 - n % 4
    if k == 4:
        k = 0
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
        j = (k - 3 * i) // 2
        if 3 * i + 2 * j <= k:
            ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts no explicit parameters and reads four integers \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from standard input. It then computes a value based on these inputs and prints the result. Specifically, it calculates the minimum cost to achieve a specific condition related to \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). If \( n \) is negative, it results in an error message, which is not possible given the problem constraints since \( n \) is defined to be a non-negative integer. The function first adjusts \( n \) to ensure it is a multiple of 4 by adding 4 if necessary. Then, it iterates through possible combinations of \( i \) and \( j \) to find the minimum cost, where the cost is calculated as \( 3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a \). The final output is the minimum cost found. If no valid combination of \( i \) and \( j \) is found, the minimum cost remains infinity, and this value is printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Alyona to buy enough copybooks so that the total number of copybooks is divisible by 4. Here’s a brief analysis of the solution:

1. **Calculate the remainder**: `k = 4 - n % 4` determines how many more copybooks are needed to reach the next multiple of 4.
2. **Edge case handling**: If `k == 4`, it sets `k = 0` to avoid unnecessary calculations.
3. **Minimize cost**: The program iterates through possible combinations of packs of 3, 2, and 1 copybooks to find the minimum cost. This ensures that the total number of additional copybooks `k` is achieved using the cheapest options first.

Since the logic handles all possible scenarios within the constraints and input ranges, the program works correctly for all given potential cases.
