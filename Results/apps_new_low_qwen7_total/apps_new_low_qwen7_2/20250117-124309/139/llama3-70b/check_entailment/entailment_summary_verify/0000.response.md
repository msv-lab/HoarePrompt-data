### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to make the total number of copybooks (initial `n` plus additional `k`) divisible by 4 with the minimum cost.
   - We need to consider the different ways to buy packs of copybooks (1, 2, or 3) and choose the least costly option.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The provided function summary states that the function calculates the minimum cost to achieve a specific condition related to \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
   - The function first determines the remainder when `n` is divided by 4 (`k = 4 - n % 4`).
   - If `k == 4`, it sets `k = 0` to avoid unnecessary calculations.
   - It then iterates through possible combinations of `i` (number of packs of 3) and `j` (number of packs of 2) to find the minimum cost.

3. **Iterative Cost Calculation**:
   - For each combination of `i` and `j`, the cost is calculated as \( 3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a \).
   - This cost calculation ensures that the total number of additional copybooks `k` is achieved using the cheapest options first.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints \(1 \leq n, a, b, c \leq 10^9\) are handled correctly.
   - The program ensures that the total number of additional copybooks `k` is achieved without exceeding the necessary number of packs.

5. **Validation**:
   - Let's validate the solution with the provided examples:
     - **Example 1**: \( n = 1 \), \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \), \( c = 4 \)
       - \( k = 4 - 1 \% 4 = 3 \)
       - The minimum cost is 3 (buying 3 packs of 1 copybook).
     - **Example 2**: \( n = 6 \), \( a = 2 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 1 \)
       - \( k = 4 - 6 \% 4 = 2 \)
       - The minimum cost is 1 (buying 1 pack of 2 copybooks).
     - **Example 3**: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 4 \), \( c = 4 \)
       - \( k = 4 - 4 \% 4 = 0 \)
       - The minimum cost is 0 (no additional copybooks needed).
     - **Example 4**: \( n = 999999999 \), \( a = 1000000000 \), \( b = 1000000000 \), \( c = 1000000000 \)
       - \( k = 4 - 999999999 \% 4 = 3 \)
       - The minimum cost is 1000000000 (buying 1 pack of 1 copybook).

Given the detailed analysis and validation, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make the total number of copybooks divisible by 4.
