Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Alyona to buy enough copybooks so that the total number of copybooks is divisible by 4. Hereâ€™s a brief analysis of the solution:

1. **Calculate the remainder**: `k = 4 - n % 4` determines how many more copybooks are needed to reach the next multiple of 4.
2. **Edge case handling**: If `k == 4`, it sets `k = 0` to avoid unnecessary calculations.
3. **Minimize cost**: The program iterates through possible combinations of packs of 3, 2, and 1 copybooks to find the minimum cost. This ensures that the total number of additional copybooks `k` is achieved using the cheapest options first.

Since the logic handles all possible scenarios within the constraints and input ranges, the program works correctly for all given potential cases.
