You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little girl Alyona is in a shop to buy some copybooks for school. She study four subjects so she wants to have equal number of copybooks for each of the subjects. There are three types of copybook's packs in the shop: it is possible to buy one copybook for a rubles, a pack of two copybooks for b rubles, and a pack of three copybooks for c rubles. Alyona already has n copybooks.

What is the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4? There are infinitely many packs of any type in the shop. Alyona can buy packs of different type in the same purchase.


-----Input-----

The only line contains 4 integers n, a, b, c (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1 3 4

Output
3

Input
6 2 1 1

Output
1

Input
4 4 4 4

Output
0

Input
999999999 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

Output
1000000000



-----Note-----

In the first example Alyona can buy 3 packs of 1 copybook for 3a = 3 rubles in total. After that she will have 4 copybooks which she can split between the subjects equally. 

In the second example Alyuna can buy a pack of 2 copybooks for b = 1 ruble. She will have 8 copybooks in total.

In the third example Alyona can split the copybooks she already has between the 4 subject equally, so she doesn't need to buy anything.

In the fourth example Alyona should buy one pack of one copybook.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    k = 4 - n % 4
    if k == 4:
        k = 0
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
        j = (k - 3 * i) // 2
        if 3 * i + 2 * j <= k:
            ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, b, c are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

k = 4 - n % 4
    if (k == 4) :
        k = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0. Since `k == 4` implies `k` is 0 in the if part, the overall postcondition matches the if part's postcondition.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
        j = (k - 3 * i) // 2
        
        if 3 * i + 2 * j <= k:
            ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the input modulo 4 plus 4, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `ans` is `6c - 3b`, `i` is 2, `j` is -3.
    print(ans)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
2. **Calculate Remaining Copies Needed**: 
   - `k = 4 - n % 4` calculates how many more copies Alyona needs to make the total number of copies a multiple of 4.
   - If `k == 4`, it sets `k = 0` because buying 4 copies at the best rate would be equivalent to not needing any additional copies since the next multiple of 4 would be achieved naturally.
3. **Find Minimum Cost**:
   - The program iterates over all possible combinations of packs of 3, 2, and 1 copybooks to find the combination that minimizes the cost while achieving `k` copies.
   - For each combination, it calculates the cost and updates the minimum cost (`ans`) if the current combination is cheaper.

Given the problem statement and constraints, this approach correctly identifies the minimum cost to achieve the required number of additional copies needed to make the total a multiple of 4. The logic accounts for all possible ways to get the remaining copies at the cheapest price by considering all combinations of the available pack sizes.

The program handles all edge cases, such as when `k == 4` (where no additional copies are needed), and it ensures that the optimal solution is found by iterating through all feasible combinations.

Therefore, the program is logically sound and correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
