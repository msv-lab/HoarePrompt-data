Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads four integers \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Modulo Calculation**: The program calculates \( k = 4 - n \% 4 \). This ensures \( n + k \) is a multiple of 4. If \( n \% 4 == 4 \), \( k \) is set to 0, which is correct because \( n \% 4 == 0 \) already.

3. **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`), ensuring any valid cost will replace it.

4. **Loop Logic**: The program iterates over possible values of \( i \) and \( j \) to minimize the cost while ensuring \( 3i + 2j \leq k \). This correctly accounts for all possible ways to reach the target using packs of 1, 2, and 3 copybooks.

5. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation \( 3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a \) is correct and matches the problem statement.

6. **Output**: The program correctly prints the minimum cost found.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost to make the total number of copybooks a multiple of 4. Therefore, the annotated program logic is consistent with the problem requirements and correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
