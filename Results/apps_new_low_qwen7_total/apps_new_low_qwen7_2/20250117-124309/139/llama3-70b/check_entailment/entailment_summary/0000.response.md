Reasoning:
1. The program correctly calculates the number of additional copybooks \( k \) needed such that \( n + k \) is a multiple of 4.
2. It then iterates over possible values of \( i \) and \( j \) to find the minimum cost of purchasing these \( k \) additional copybooks using packs of 3, 2, and 1 respectively.
3. The cost calculation \( 3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a \) is logically sound and covers all possible ways to purchase the required number of copybooks.
4. The code handles the case where \( k \) is exactly 4 (which means \( n \mod 4 = 0 \)) by setting \( k = 0 \).
5. The logic seems to cover all possible scenarios within the constraints provided.

Given that the logic appears to align with the problem statement and the execution summary accurately describes the intended behavior of the program, the program should work as expected under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
