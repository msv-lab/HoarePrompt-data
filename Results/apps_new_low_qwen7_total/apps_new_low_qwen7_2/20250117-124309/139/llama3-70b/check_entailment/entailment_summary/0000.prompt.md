Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Little girl Alyona is in a shop to buy some copybooks for school. She study four subjects so she wants to have equal number of copybooks for each of the subjects. There are three types of copybook's packs in the shop: it is possible to buy one copybook for a rubles, a pack of two copybooks for b rubles, and a pack of three copybooks for c rubles. Alyona already has n copybooks.

What is the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4? There are infinitely many packs of any type in the shop. Alyona can buy packs of different type in the same purchase.


-----Input-----

The only line contains 4 integers n, a, b, c (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1 3 4

Output
3

Input
6 2 1 1

Output
1

Input
4 4 4 4

Output
0

Input
999999999 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

Output
1000000000



-----Note-----

In the first example Alyona can buy 3 packs of 1 copybook for 3a = 3 rubles in total. After that she will have 4 copybooks which she can split between the subjects equally. 

In the second example Alyuna can buy a pack of 2 copybooks for b = 1 ruble. She will have 8 copybooks in total.

In the third example Alyona can split the copybooks she already has between the 4 subject equally, so she doesn't need to buy anything.

In the fourth example Alyona should buy one pack of one copybook.

# Program:
def func():
    (n, a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    k = 4 - n % 4
    if k == 4:
        k = 0
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
        j = (k - 3 * i) // 2
        if 3 * i + 2 * j <= k:
            ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
    print(ans)





# Execution Summary:
The function accepts no explicit parameters and reads four integers \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from standard input. It then computes a value based on these inputs and prints the result. Specifically, it calculates the minimum cost to achieve a specific condition related to \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). If \( n \) is negative, it results in an error message, which is not possible given the problem constraints since \( n \) is defined to be a non-negative integer. The function first adjusts \( n \) to ensure it is a multiple of 4 by adding 4 if necessary. Then, it iterates through possible combinations of \( i \) and \( j \) to find the minimum cost, where the cost is calculated as \( 3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a \). The final output is the minimum cost found. If no valid combination of \( i \) and \( j \) is found, the minimum cost remains infinity, and this value is printed.
