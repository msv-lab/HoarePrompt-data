The function accepts no explicit parameters and reads four integers \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from standard input. It then computes a value based on these inputs and prints the result. Specifically, it calculates the minimum cost to achieve a specific condition related to \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). If \( n \) is negative, it results in an error message, which is not possible given the problem constraints since \( n \) is defined to be a non-negative integer. The function first adjusts \( n \) to ensure it is a multiple of 4 by adding 4 if necessary. Then, it iterates through possible combinations of \( i \) and \( j \) to find the minimum cost, where the cost is calculated as \( 3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a \). The final output is the minimum cost found. If no valid combination of \( i \) and \( j \) is found, the minimum cost remains infinity, and this value is printed.
