Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine if an array is unimodal based on the specified conditions. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes flags `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` to keep track of the state transitions of the array elements.
2. **Loop Through Array**: It iterates through the array starting from the second element to check the sequence:
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one, it sets `increasing` to `True` and checks if `decreasing` is already `True`. If so, it prints 'NO' and exits, indicating that the sequence cannot be unimodal.
   - If the current element is equal to the previous one, it sets `constant` to `True` if `increasing` is `True`.
   - If the current element is less than the previous one, it sets `decreasing` to `True` and ensures that `increasing` is not `True`.
3. **Final Output**: If no sequence violations are found, it prints 'YES'.

This approach correctly identifies the start of each block and ensures that the sequence adheres to the unimodal pattern without any interruptions.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program appears to work correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
