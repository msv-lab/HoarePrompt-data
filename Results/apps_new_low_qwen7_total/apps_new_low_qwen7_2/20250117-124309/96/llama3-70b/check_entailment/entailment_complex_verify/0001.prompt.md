You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Array of integers is unimodal, if:

  it is strictly increasing in the beginning;  after that it is constant;  after that it is strictly decreasing. 

The first block (increasing) and the last block (decreasing) may be absent. It is allowed that both of this blocks are absent.

For example, the following three arrays are unimodal: [5, 7, 11, 11, 2, 1], [4, 4, 2], [7], but the following three are not unimodal: [5, 5, 6, 6, 1], [1, 2, 1, 2], [4, 5, 5, 6].

Write a program that checks if an array is unimodal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1 000) — the elements of the array.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the given array is unimodal. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 5 5 5 4 2

Output
YES

Input
5
10 20 30 20 10

Output
YES

Input
4
1 2 1 2

Output
NO

Input
7
3 3 3 3 3 3 3

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first example the array is unimodal, because it is strictly increasing in the beginning (from position 1 to position 2, inclusively), that it is constant (from position 2 to position 4, inclusively) and then it is strictly decreasing (from position 4 to position 6, inclusively).

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    increasing = False
    constant = False
    decreasing = False
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            if decreasing:
                print('NO')
                exit()
            increasing = True
        elif arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
                constant = True
        else:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
            decreasing = True
    print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

increasing = False

constant = False

decreasing = False
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            if decreasing:
                print('NO')
                exit()
            increasing = True
        elif arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
                constant = True
        else:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
            decreasing = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `increasing` is a boolean value indicating whether there was an increasing sequence detected, `decreasing` is a boolean value indicating whether there was a decreasing sequence detected, `constant` is True if there were no changes between consecutive elements.
    print('YES')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer \( n \) and an array of \( n \) integers from the user input. It then checks whether the array is either strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or constant. If the array contains any element that breaks these sequences, it prints 'NO' and exits immediately. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program initializes flags for `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` states.
2. It iterates through the array starting from the second element to check the conditions for being unimodal:
   - If it finds an increase and then encounters a decrease before the array is flagged as `decreasing`, it prints 'NO' immediately and exits.
   - If it finds an increase followed by a constant period, it sets the `increasing` flag to `False` and `constant` flag to `True`.
   - If it finds a decrease after a constant period, it sets the `decreasing` flag to `True`.
3. After the loop, it prints 'YES', indicating the array is unimodal if no violations of the unimodal condition were found.

Given the logic, the program correctly identifies unimodal arrays according to the specified rules. Here's a breakdown of some test cases:

- For `[1, 5, 5, 5, 4, 2]`, the program correctly identifies it as unimodal.
- For `[10, 20, 30, 20, 10]`, it also correctly identifies it as unimodal.
- For `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, it correctly identifies it as non-unimodal.
- For `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, it correctly identifies it as unimodal.

Since the logic matches the definition of an unimodal array and the provided examples validate the correctness, the given program is correct.
