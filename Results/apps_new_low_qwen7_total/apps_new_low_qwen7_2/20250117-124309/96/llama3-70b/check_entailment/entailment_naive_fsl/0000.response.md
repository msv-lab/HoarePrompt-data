Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is constant throughout. For example, consider the input:

```
Input:
3
5 5 5
```

The program should output "YES" because the array is constant, which is a valid unimodal array. However, the program currently does not handle this case correctly. Specifically, the program sets `constant` to `True` only when the current element equals the previous element, and it does not account for the possibility that the entire array could be constant from the start without ever transitioning to an increasing or decreasing sequence.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the entire array is constant at the end. Here is a modified version of the program that addresses this issue:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    increasing = False
    constant = False
    decreasing = False
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            if decreasing:
                print('NO')
                exit()
            increasing = True
        elif arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
                constant = True
        else:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
            decreasing = True
    
    # Check if the entire array is constant
    if constant and not increasing and not decreasing:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This modified program will correctly identify constant arrays as unimodal.
