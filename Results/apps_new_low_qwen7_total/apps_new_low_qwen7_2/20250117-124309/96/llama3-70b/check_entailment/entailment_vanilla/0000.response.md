Reasoning:

1. The program initializes flags for `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` states.
2. It iterates through the array starting from the second element to check the conditions for being unimodal:
   - If it finds an increase and then encounters a decrease before the array is flagged as `decreasing`, it prints 'NO' immediately and exits.
   - If it finds an increase followed by a constant period, it sets the `increasing` flag to `False` and `constant` flag to `True`.
   - If it finds a decrease after a constant period, it sets the `decreasing` flag to `True`.
3. After the loop, it prints 'YES', indicating the array is unimodal if no violations of the unimodal condition were found.

Given the logic, the program correctly identifies unimodal arrays according to the specified rules. Here's a breakdown of some test cases:

- For `[1, 5, 5, 5, 4, 2]`, the program correctly identifies it as unimodal.
- For `[10, 20, 30, 20, 10]`, it also correctly identifies it as unimodal.
- For `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, it correctly identifies it as non-unimodal.
- For `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, it correctly identifies it as unimodal.

Since the logic matches the definition of an unimodal array and the provided examples validate the correctness, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
