Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) and an array of \( n \) integers from the user input. It then checks whether the array is either strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or constant. If the array contains any element that breaks these sequences, it prints 'NO' and exits immediately. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value.**

This function determines if an array of integers can be classified into one of three categories: strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or constant. It performs the following steps:
1. Reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array itself from the input.
2. Iterates through the array starting from the second element.
3. Checks if the current element is greater than the previous one, indicating an increasing sequence.
4. Checks if the current element is equal to the previous one, indicating a constant sequence.
5. Checks if the current element is less than the previous one, indicating a decreasing sequence.
6. If any of these conditions break the current sequence (e.g., a decrease after an increase), it prints 'NO' and exits.
7. If the loop completes without finding any breaks in the sequence, it prints 'YES'.

Potential edge cases and considerations:
- The function correctly handles arrays where elements are equal, treating them as part of a constant sequence.
- It also correctly identifies strictly increasing and strictly decreasing sequences.
- If the array has only one element, the function will print 'YES' because a single element array is trivially both increasing and decreasing and constant.
- The function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer inputs for \( n \) or array elements) beyond exiting immediately with 'NO' upon detecting a sequence break.
