Output State: **i is 2, n is greater than 2**

Explanation: The provided code consists of two lines. The first line prints 'NO' and does not affect any variables. The second line uses the `exit()` function, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no further lines of code are executed, and the variables `i` and `n` retain their initial states. Therefore, the final output state is that `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2.
