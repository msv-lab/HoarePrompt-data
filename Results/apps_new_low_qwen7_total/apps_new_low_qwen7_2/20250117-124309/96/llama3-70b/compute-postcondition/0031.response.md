Output State: **i is 3, n is greater than 3**

Explanation:
- The first line `print('NO')` prints 'NO' to the console but does not affect any variables.
- The second line `exit()` terminates the program immediately without changing any variable values or executing further lines of code.
Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
