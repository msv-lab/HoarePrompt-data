Output State: **decreasing is False**

Explanation: The code block contains only two lines. The first line prints 'NO', but this does not affect any variable values. The second line uses the `exit()` function, which terminates the program immediately. According to the Python documentation, when `exit()` is called, it raises a `SystemExit` exception, and any active finally clauses of try statements are executed; when control flows off the end of the `try`, a default finally clause at the end of the module is also executed. After executing the finally blocks, the program exits. 

Given the precondition, `decreasing` is initially `True`. Since the `exit()` function is called and there is no code after it that could change the value of `decreasing`, the value of `decreasing` remains `False` in the final state. All other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not referenced or modified within the code block.
