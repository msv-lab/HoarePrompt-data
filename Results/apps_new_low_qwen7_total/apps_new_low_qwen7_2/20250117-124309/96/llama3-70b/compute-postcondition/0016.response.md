The variable `decreasing` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `increasing`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `increasing` is False, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `decreasing` is True**
