The code `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console but does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `increasing`, `decreasing`, or `constant`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `increasing` is a boolean value indicating whether there was an increasing sequence detected, `decreasing` is a boolean value indicating whether there was a decreasing sequence detected, `constant` is True if there were no changes between consecutive elements. The console prints 'YES'**
