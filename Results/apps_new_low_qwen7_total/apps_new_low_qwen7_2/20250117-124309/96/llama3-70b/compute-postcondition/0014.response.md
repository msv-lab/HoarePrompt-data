The variable `increasing` is assigned the value `False`, which changes its state. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`; `increasing` is `False`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`; `increasing` is `False`**
