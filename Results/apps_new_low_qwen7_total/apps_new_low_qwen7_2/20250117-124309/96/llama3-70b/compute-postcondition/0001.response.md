Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
   - There are additional variables mentioned (arr, increasing, constant, decreasing) but they are not directly controlling the loop execution.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will start with `i` set to 1 and increment `i` until it reaches `n`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Initial Values:**
   - Given that `i` is initially set to 1 (as per the range `range(1, n)`).
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be 1 and `n` should be greater than 1.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The state of `i` and `n` are crucial for the loop to execute the first time. Since `i` is fixed at 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
