Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2
- `increasing` is determined based on the condition `arr[i] > arr[i - 1]`
- `constant` is True if `arr[i] == arr[i - 1]`
- `decreasing` is True otherwise

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2, meaning the loop has already executed for `i = 1` and `i = 2`.

### Determining the Next State
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3.
- Since the loop condition is `i < n`, `n` must still be greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue.

### Adjusted States
- `i` will be incremented from 2 to 3.
- `n` must still be greater than 3 to allow the loop to execute again.

### Final State
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3**
