The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it takes input from the user in the form of two lines. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) representing the elements of the array. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, forming an array, without returning any specific value.

Functionality: **The function accepts input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, forming an array, without returning any specific value.**
