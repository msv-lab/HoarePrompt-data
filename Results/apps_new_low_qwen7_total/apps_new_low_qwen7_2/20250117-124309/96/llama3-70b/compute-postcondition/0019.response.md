Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - If `arr[1]` is greater than `arr[0]`, then `increasing` is True.
   - If `arr[1]` is equal to `arr[0]`, then either `constant` is True (if `increasing` is False) or the conditions remain as stated in the precondition.
   - If `arr[1]` is less than `arr[0]`, then `decreasing` is True and `increasing` is False.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 1.
   - The value of `arr[1]` and its comparison with `arr[0]` determines the values of `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing`.

Given these points, we can update the states as follows:

- `i` will be 2.
- `n` remains the same and is still greater than 1.
- The values of `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` depend on the comparison between `arr[2]` and `arr[1]`. However, since we are adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time, we don't need to specify the exact values of `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` based on the previous condition. We just need to ensure that the loop can execute, which it can if `n` is greater than 2.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
