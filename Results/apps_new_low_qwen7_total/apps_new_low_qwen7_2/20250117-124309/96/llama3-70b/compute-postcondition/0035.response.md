Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `increasing` is False, then the function continues with the current state of `i` and `n`. Since there is no else part, and `constant` being True does not affect the values of `i` and `n`, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.***
