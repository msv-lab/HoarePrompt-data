The function reads an integer \( n \) and an array of \( n \) integers from the user input. It then checks whether the array is either strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or constant. If the array contains any element that breaks these sequences, it prints 'NO' and exits immediately. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value.
