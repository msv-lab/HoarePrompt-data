Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and function summary to determine the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Functionality Overview**:
   - The function `func_1` processes a string of 'G' and 'S' characters representing golden and silver trophies.
   - It identifies contiguous segments of 'G' characters and calculates the maximum length of these segments.
   - It also checks if there are consecutive segments separated by exactly one 'S' character and updates the maximum length accordingly.
   - Finally, it returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and the length of the `trophies` string.

2. **Edge Cases and Specific Scenarios**:
   - **Case with No Golden Trophies**: The function correctly returns 0 if there are no segments of 'G'.
     - Example: Input `SSS`, Output `0`.
   - **Case with One Segment of Golden Trophies**: The function returns the length of this segment.
     - Example: Input `GGGG`, Output `4`.
   - **Case with Multiple Segments and One Silver Separating Them**: The function updates the maximum length by combining these segments.
     - Example: Input `GGGSGGGSGG`, Output `7`.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment claimed that the function does not handle the case where there are no golden trophies, which is incorrect. The function correctly returns 0 in such cases.
   - The function logic is sound and correctly handles all the mentioned edge cases and scenarios.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate. The function `func_1` correctly handles all the specified edge cases and behaves as expected based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
