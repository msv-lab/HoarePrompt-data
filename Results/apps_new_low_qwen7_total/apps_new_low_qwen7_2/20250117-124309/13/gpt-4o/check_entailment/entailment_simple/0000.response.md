### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Segment Detection:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and detects segments of consecutive 'G' characters. This part is handled by the `func_1` function using a `while` loop that iterates through the `trophies` string and identifies each segment of 'G' characters.

2. **Initial Maximum Length Calculation:**
   - After detecting all segments, the program calculates the initial maximum length of these segments using a generator expression inside the `max` function. This step ensures that the maximum length of any single segment of 'G' characters is found.

3. **Handling Single Segment Case:**
   - If there is only one segment of 'G' characters, the function directly returns this maximum length, which is correct since no swap can increase the length further.

4. **Checking for Possible Swaps:**
   - The program then checks for potential swaps that could increase the length of the longest segment. Specifically, it looks for cases where the gap between two segments is exactly 2 (one 'S' trophy). In such cases, swapping the 'S' trophy with a 'G' trophy from the adjacent segment would create a longer segment of 'G' trophies.
   
5. **Updating Maximum Length:**
   - For each identified gap of 2, the program updates the `max_length` to consider the combined length of the two segments plus the length of the 'S' trophy that is being swapped.

6. **Returning the Result:**
   - Finally, the program returns the maximum length of the longest segment of 'G' trophies, considering the possibility of one swap. It ensures that the result does not exceed the total number of trophies (`n`).

### Conclusion:

The program logic correctly identifies and calculates the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies after allowing at most one swap. The conditions and logic used to find the optimal segments and handle swaps are sound and cover all necessary cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
