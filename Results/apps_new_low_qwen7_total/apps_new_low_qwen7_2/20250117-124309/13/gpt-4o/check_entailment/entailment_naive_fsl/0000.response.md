Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no golden trophies at all. In such a scenario, the function `func_1` incorrectly returns the maximum length of a segment plus one, which is not valid since there are no golden trophies to begin with. This can be seen in the third example:

**Input:**
```
3
SSS
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

Although the output is correct in this case, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed because it does not explicitly handle the case where there are no golden trophies. The function assumes there is at least one segment of golden trophies, which is not always true. To fix this, the function should check if there are any golden trophies before proceeding with the logic to find the maximum possible beauty.
