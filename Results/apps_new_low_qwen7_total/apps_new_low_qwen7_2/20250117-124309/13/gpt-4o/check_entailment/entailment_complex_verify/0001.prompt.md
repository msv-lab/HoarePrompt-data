You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.

    #`The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and the length of string 'trophies' (n)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) and `trophies` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy). The function identifies contiguous segments of 'G' characters within the `trophies` string and calculates the maximum length of these segments. It also checks for a specific condition where two segments are separated by exactly one 'S' character and updates the maximum length accordingly. Based on certain conditions, the function returns either 0, the maximum length of any segment of 'G' characters, or the minimum value between the maximum length plus one and the length of the `trophies` string.

After the function concludes, the following state will be true:
- If no segments of 'G' characters exist, the function returns 0.
- If there is only one segment of 'G' characters, the function returns its length.
- If there are multiple segments, the function checks if consecutive segments are separated by exactly one 'S' character. If this condition is met, it updates the maximum length accordingly.
- Finally, the function returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and the length of the `trophies` string.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where there are no 'G' segments (returns 0).
- The function correctly handles the case where there is only one segment of 'G' characters (returns its length).
- The function correctly updates the maximum length when consecutive segments are separated by exactly one 'S' character.
- The function correctly returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and the length of the `trophies` string.
- However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where segments are separated by more than one 'S' character, although this is covered implicitly by the logic.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Parsing**:
   - The code correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts to get the number of trophies (`n`) and the string representing the trophies.
   
2. **Segmentation of Golden Trophies**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies and groups consecutive segments of golden trophies. This is done using a loop that iterates through the string and finds continuous sequences of 'G'.
   - It stores these segments as tuples `(start, end)` in the `segments` list.

3. **Initial Maximum Length Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the initial maximum length of any segment of golden trophies, which is necessary to know the current best before any swaps.

4. **Handling Single Segment Case**:
   - If there is only one segment of golden trophies, the function correctly returns the length of this segment without further processing.

5. **Handling Multiple Segments**:
   - The code then checks if there are multiple segments of golden trophies.
   - For each pair of consecutive segments, it checks if they can be connected by a single swap (if the gap between them is exactly 1 trophy).
   - In this case, it calculates the new potential maximum length by merging the two segments and adding 1 to account for the swapped trophy.

6. **Final Result**:
   - The function returns the maximum length found, ensuring that the result does not exceed the total number of trophies (`n`).

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly handles all aspects of the problem: identifying segments of golden trophies, calculating the initial maximum length, checking for potential swaps, and determining the final maximum length. The logic is sound and should work for all valid inputs as specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
