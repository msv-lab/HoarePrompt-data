### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Parsing**:
   - The code correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts to get the number of trophies (`n`) and the string representing the trophies.
   
2. **Segmentation of Golden Trophies**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies and groups consecutive segments of golden trophies. This is done using a loop that iterates through the string and finds continuous sequences of 'G'.
   - It stores these segments as tuples `(start, end)` in the `segments` list.

3. **Initial Maximum Length Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the initial maximum length of any segment of golden trophies, which is necessary to know the current best before any swaps.

4. **Handling Single Segment Case**:
   - If there is only one segment of golden trophies, the function correctly returns the length of this segment without further processing.

5. **Handling Multiple Segments**:
   - The code then checks if there are multiple segments of golden trophies.
   - For each pair of consecutive segments, it checks if they can be connected by a single swap (if the gap between them is exactly 1 trophy).
   - In this case, it calculates the new potential maximum length by merging the two segments and adding 1 to account for the swapped trophy.

6. **Final Result**:
   - The function returns the maximum length found, ensuring that the result does not exceed the total number of trophies (`n`).

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly handles all aspects of the problem: identifying segments of golden trophies, calculating the initial maximum length, checking for potential swaps, and determining the final maximum length. The logic is sound and should work for all valid inputs as specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
