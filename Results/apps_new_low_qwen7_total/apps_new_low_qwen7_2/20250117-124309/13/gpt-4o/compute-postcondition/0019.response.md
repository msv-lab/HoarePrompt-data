Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop condition is `i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`, as well as the value of `trophies[i]`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `start` is `i`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'.
   - `segments` is a list.
   - `i` is less than `n` and `trophies[i]` is 'G'.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'` must be true.
   - Since `i` is already increased by 1 after the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'` for the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'` for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 after the previous iteration, we need to check if `i` is still within the bounds of `n` and if `trophies[i]` is still 'G'.

Given these considerations, the state adjustments required are:
- `i` should be such that `i < n` and `trophies[i]` is 'G' for the next iteration.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 after the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` and `trophies[i]` is 'G'. 

Therefore, the state adjustments are:
- `i` must be less than `n` and `trophies[i]` must be 'G'.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` must be less than `n` and `trophies[i]` must be 'G'**
