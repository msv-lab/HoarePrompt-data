Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', `segments` contains the element `(start, i - 1)` where `start` is equal to `i - 1`. If `trophies[i]` is not 'G', `i` is set to `i + 1` and `segments` remains unchanged.***
