`i` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `i` changes from 0 to 1. The other variables (`n`, `trophies`, `segments`, and `start`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` must start with the character 'G', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `start` is 0**
