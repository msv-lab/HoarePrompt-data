The code `segments.append((start, i - 1))` appends a tuple containing the values of `start` and `i - 1` to the list `segments`. 

- The value of `start` is 0, as given in the initial state.
- The value of `i` is the smallest index such that `trophies[i] != 'G'` or `n` if `trophies` contains only 'G' characters.

Therefore, after appending the tuple `(start, i - 1)`, the value of `segments` will be a list containing this single tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` can contain any combination of 'G' and 'S' but will have at least one 'G' if `i` is not `n`, `segments` is a list containing the tuple `(0, i - 1)`, `i` is the smallest index such that `trophies[i] != 'G'` or `n` if `trophies` contains only 'G' characters, `start` is 0.**
