Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, both conditions in the loop head must be true.
   - The first condition is `i < n`.
   - The second condition is `trophies[i] == 'G'`.

Given that `i` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 1`.

For the loop to execute again:
- `i_new` must be less than `n` (i.e., `i + 1 < n`).
- The character at index `i_new` in the string `trophies` must be 'G'.

Since `i` was increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must still be within the bounds of the string and the character at `i` must be 'G'. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` and the character at `i` must be 'G'.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` must be less than `n` and the character at `i` in `trophies` must be 'G'.

The final state can be represented as:

**State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `i` must be less than `n` and `trophies[i]` must be 'G'**.
