The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `i` must be less than `n - 1`. After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` should still satisfy this condition since the original value was less than `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list, `i` is increased by 1, `start` is equal to `i - 1`, and `trophies[i]` must be 'G'**
