The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'`. Since the final state of `i` is `n`, the loop has terminated. This means that the loop did not find any more 'G' characters after the initial position of `i`. Therefore, `segments.append((start, i - 1))` will append the tuple `(start, n - 1)` to the `segments` list, as `i - 1` is `n - 1`.

The output state remains as follows:
- `start` is `i`, which is `n`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `segments` is a list that now contains the tuple `(start, n - 1)`.

Output State: **`start` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing the tuple `(start, n - 1)`.**
