Initial State: `total` is undefined, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing all contiguous segments of 'G' characters in `trophies` with at least 2 elements, `i` must be less than `len(segments)`, `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of 'G' characters in `trophies`

Code Block:
```
prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
```

Analysis:
- The first line `prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]` assigns the start and end indices of the segment before the current one (segment `i-1`) to `prev_start` and `prev_end` respectively.
- The second line `curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]` assigns the start and end indices of the current segment (segment `i`) to `curr_start` and `curr_end` respectively.

Since no other variables are affected, and no values are assigned to `total` or `max_length`, these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **total is undefined, trophies is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', segments is a list containing all contiguous segments of 'G' characters in trophies with at least 2 elements, i is less than len(segments), max_length is the maximum length of any segment of 'G' characters in trophies, prev_start is the start index of the segment i-1, prev_end is the end index of the segment i-1, curr_start is the start index of the segment i, curr_end is the end index of the segment i**
