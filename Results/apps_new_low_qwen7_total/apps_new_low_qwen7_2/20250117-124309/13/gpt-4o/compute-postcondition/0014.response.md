Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list. If the first non-'G' character in `trophies` (starting from index 0) is found, `segments` will contain the tuple `(0, i - 1)` where `i` is the smallest index such that `trophies[i] != 'G'`. If `trophies` consists only of 'G' characters, `segments` remains empty and `i` is set to `n`. If no non-'G' character is found, `segments` remains empty and `i` is set to 1.***
