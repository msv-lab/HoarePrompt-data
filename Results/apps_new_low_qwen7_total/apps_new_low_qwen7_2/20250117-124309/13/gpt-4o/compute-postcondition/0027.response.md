Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', `segments` is a list containing the tuple `(start, n - 1)`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `trophies[i]` is 'S'.***
