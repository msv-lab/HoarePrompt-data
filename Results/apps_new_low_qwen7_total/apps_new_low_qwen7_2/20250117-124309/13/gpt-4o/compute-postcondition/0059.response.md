Output State: **segments is a list containing at least two tuples, i is 2, prev_start and prev_end are the start and end values of the tuple at index 1 of segments, curr_start and curr_end are the start and end values of the tuple at index 1 of segments**

Explanation:
The code snippet does not modify any existing variables or introduce new ones. It simply unpacks the values from the tuple at index `i-1` (which is 1) of the `segments` list into `prev_start` and `prev_end`, and then it unpacks the values from the tuple at index `i` (which is 2) of the `segments` list into `curr_start` and `curr_end`. Therefore, the only impact is on the values of `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end`, which are now referencing the elements of the appropriate tuples in the `segments` list.
