Postcondition: ***`max_length` remains unchanged, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing all contiguous segments of 'G' characters in `trophies` with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than `len(segments)`, `prev_start` is the start index of the segment `i-1`, `prev_end` is the end index of the segment `i-1`, `curr_start` is the start index of the segment `i`, `curr_end` is the end index of the segment `i`. If `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, then `max_length` remains 5. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
