First, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: `prev_start` is 0, `prev_end` is 5, `curr_start` is 7, `curr_end` is 10, `trophies` is 4, `max_length` is 5.

The code snippet is:
```python
max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
```

Let's evaluate the expression inside the `max` function:
- `curr_end - curr_start + 1`: This is \(10 - 7 + 1 = 4\).
- `prev_end - prev_start + 1`: This is \(5 - 0 + 1 = 6\).

So, the expression inside the `max` function becomes:
\[ \max(5, 4 + 6 + 1) = \max(5, 11) = 11 \]

Thus, `max_length` is updated to 11.

The output state is: `prev_start` is 0, `prev_end` is 5, `curr_start` is 7, `curr_end` is 10, `trophies` is 4, `max_length` is 11.

Output State: **`prev_start` is 0, `prev_end` is 5, `curr_start` is 7, `curr_end` is 10, `trophies` is 4, `max_length` is 11**
