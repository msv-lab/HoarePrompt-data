Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing all contiguous segments of 'G' characters in `trophies`, represented as tuples `(start, end)`, each tuple indicating the starting and ending indices (inclusive) of each segment of 'G' characters, and `i` is set to `n` because the loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`. `segments` is not an empty list**
