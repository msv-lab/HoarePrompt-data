The value of `i` is incremented by 1, meaning `i` is now two more than its original value. It is still less than `n`, and `trophies[i]` must be 'G'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is two more than its original value and still less than `n`; `trophies[i]` is 'G'**
