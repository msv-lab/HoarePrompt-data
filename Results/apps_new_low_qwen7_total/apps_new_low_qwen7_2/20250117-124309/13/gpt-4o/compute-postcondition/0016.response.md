The variable `start` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^5\). The values of `trophies` and `segments` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is `i`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list, and `i` is less than `n`.**
