Based on the provided code snippet and initial state, we need to analyze the impact of the following lines:

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'.

Code Snippet:
```
segments = []
i = 0
```

### Analysis:
- The first line initializes an empty list called `segments`.
- The second line initializes an integer variable `i` and sets it to 0.

### Final Output State:
No further operations are specified in the code snippet to modify the initial state or the newly initialized variables. Therefore, the final state of the program remains as follows:

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, trophies is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', segments is an empty list, i is 0**
