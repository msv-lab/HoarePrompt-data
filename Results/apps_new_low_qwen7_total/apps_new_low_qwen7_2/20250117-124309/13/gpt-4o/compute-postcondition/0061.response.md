Postcondition: ***`segments` is a list containing at least two tuples, `i` is 2, `prev_start` and `prev_end` are the start and end values of the tuple at index 1 of `segments`, `curr_start` and `curr_end` are the start and end values of the tuple at index 1 of `segments`, and `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the computed value of `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`.***
