To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop condition is `i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'`.
2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The first part of the condition is `i < n`.
   - The second part of the condition is `trophies[i] == 'G'`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` has been incremented by 1.

4. **Check each part of the loop condition**:
   - **Condition `i < n`**: Since `i` has been incremented by 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be such that `i < n` holds true.
   - **Condition `trophies[i] == 'G'`**: For the loop to continue, the element at index `i` in the `trophies` list must be 'G'. This means `trophies[i]` should be 'G'.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that both conditions hold true for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` has been incremented by 1, the new value of `i` must satisfy `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are to ensure that `i` is such that `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be such that i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'**
