Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list. After the loop completes, `segments` will contain all contiguous segments of 'G' characters in `trophies`, represented as tuples `(start, end)`. Each tuple indicates the starting and ending indices (inclusive) of each segment of 'G' characters. The variable `i` will be set to `n` because the loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`.

- **Constant Variables:** None of the variables (`n`, `trophies`, `segments`, `i`) are constant; they can all change depending on the input.
- **Final Values:**
  - `n`: Remains the same as the initial value.
  - `trophies`: Remains the same as the initial value.
  - `segments`: Contains a list of tuples indicating all contiguous segments of 'G' characters in `trophies`.
  - `i`: Set to `n` after the loop ends.
- **Conditions:**
  - The loop executes until `i` equals `n`. It increments `i` whenever `trophies[i]` is 'S' or when it encounters the end of the string.
  - If `trophies` consists entirely of 'S' characters, `segments` will be an empty list, and `i` will be set to `n`.
  - If there are no 'G' characters in `trophies`, `segments` will also be an empty list, and `i` will be set to `n`.

This ensures that all segments of 'G' characters are captured, and the loop terminates when all elements of `trophies` have been processed.
