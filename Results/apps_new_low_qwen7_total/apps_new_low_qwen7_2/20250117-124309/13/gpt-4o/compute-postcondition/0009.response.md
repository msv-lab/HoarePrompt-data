The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state where `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'`, after the increment, the new value of `i` will be one more than its previous value, but it must still satisfy the condition `i < n`. The condition `trophies[i] == 'G'` remains valid as long as the incremented `i` still points to an element in the list where the element is 'G'.

Therefore, the updated state is: `i` is now `i + 1` and still satisfies `i < n`; `trophies[i] == 'G'`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` and still satisfies `i < n`; `trophies[i] == 'G'**.
