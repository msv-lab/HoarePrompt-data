You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []

i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list. After the loop completes, `segments` will contain all contiguous segments of 'G' characters in `trophies`, represented as tuples `(start, end)`. Each tuple indicates the starting and ending indices (inclusive) of each segment of 'G' characters. The variable `i` will be set to `n` because the loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`.
    #
    #-
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing all contiguous segments of 'G' characters in `trophies`, represented as tuples `(start, end)`, each tuple indicating the starting and ending indices (inclusive) of each segment of 'G' characters, and `i` is set to `n` because the loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`. `segments` is not an empty list
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns `max_length` which is the maximum length of any segment of 'G' characters in `trophies`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing all contiguous segments of 'G' characters in `trophies`, represented as tuples `(start, end)`, each tuple indicating the starting and ending indices (inclusive) of each segment of 'G' characters, and `i` is set to `n+1` because the loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n` and then moves to the next iteration, `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of 'G' characters in `trophies`. The condition `len(segments) == 1` is false.
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing all contiguous segments of 'G' characters in `trophies`, `i` is equal to `len(segments)`, and `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of 'G' characters in `trophies` updated based on the condition `curr_start - prev_end == 2`.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #`The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and the length of string 'trophies' (n)`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. 
#- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
#- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.
#
#The function has three possible return cases:
#- Case_1: The function returns 0.
#- Case_2: The function returns `max_length`, which is the maximum length of any segment of 'G' characters in `trophies`.
#- Case_3: The function returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and the length of string 'trophies' (n).
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies`, and based on the conditions provided, return either 0, the maximum length of any segment of 'G' characters, or the minimum value between that maximum length plus one and the length of the string `trophies`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns `max_length` which is the maximum length of any segment of 'G' characters in `trophies`

Case_3: `The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and the length of string 'trophies' (n)`


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
