The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` must be less than `n` before the increment, after the increment, `i` is one more than its original value. The condition that `trophies[i]` must be 'G' remains unchanged because the code does not affect the `trophies` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is one more than its original value and must still be less than `n`; `trophies[i]` must be 'G'.

Output State: **`i` is one more than its original value and must still be less than `n`; `trophies[i]` must be 'G'**
