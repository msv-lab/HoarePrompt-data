The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. 
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.

The function has three possible return cases:
- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns `max_length`, which is the maximum length of any segment of 'G' characters in `trophies`.
- Case_3: The function returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and the length of string 'trophies' (n).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies`, and based on the conditions provided, return either 0, the maximum length of any segment of 'G' characters, or the minimum value between that maximum length plus one and the length of the string `trophies`.
