#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) and `trophies` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy). The function identifies contiguous segments of 'G' characters within the `trophies` string and calculates the maximum length of these segments. It also checks for a specific condition where two segments are separated by exactly one 'S' character and updates the maximum length accordingly. Based on certain conditions, the function returns either 0, the maximum length of any segment of 'G' characters, or the minimum value between the maximum length plus one and the length of the `trophies` string.

After the function concludes, the following state will be true:
- If no segments of 'G' characters exist, the function returns 0.
- If there is only one segment of 'G' characters, the function returns its length.
- If there are multiple segments, the function checks if consecutive segments are separated by exactly one 'S' character. If this condition is met, it updates the maximum length accordingly.
- Finally, the function returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and the length of the `trophies` string.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where there are no 'G' segments (returns 0).
- The function correctly handles the case where there is only one segment of 'G' characters (returns its length).
- The function correctly updates the maximum length when consecutive segments are separated by exactly one 'S' character.
- The function correctly returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and the length of the `trophies` string.
- However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where segments are separated by more than one 'S' character, although this is covered implicitly by the logic.
