You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...

Your task is to print the $k$-th digit of this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) — the position to process ($1$-based index).


-----Output-----

Print the $k$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
7

Input
21

Output
5

- Program:
def func():
    k = int(input())
    n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        k -= len(s)
        n += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `k` from the user, where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). It then finds the \((k-1)\)-th character of the smallest integer whose length is at least \(k\). If no such integer exists (which theoretically should not happen given the constraints), the function will eventually find an integer large enough to satisfy the condition. After finding the integer, it prints the \((k-1)\)-th character of that integer and terminates. The function ensures that \(k\) is reduced to 0 after finding the appropriate integer, and \(n\) is set to 10 at the end of the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To solve this problem, the program attempts to find the exact number and digit that corresponds to the given `k` in the infinite sequence. Here’s how it works:

1. It initializes `n` to 1, representing the current number being considered.
2. In each iteration of the loop, it converts the current number `n` to a string `s`.
3. If the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the desired digit is within the digits of `n`. The code then prints the `k`-th digit (considering 1-based indexing) and breaks out of the loop.
4. If the length of `s` is less than `k`, it subtracts the length of `s` from `k` and increments `n` to consider the next number in the sequence.
5. This process continues until the desired digit is found.

Given the constraints and the logic of the solution, let's test the program with the examples provided and consider the edge cases:

1. For `k = 7`, the program should output '7'. The sequence at positions 1 through 7 is "1234567", so the 7th digit is indeed '7'.
2. For `k = 21`, the program should output '5'. The sequence at positions 19 through 21 is "192021", and the 21st digit is '5'.

The logic seems sound, but we need to ensure it handles large values of `k` correctly and doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop or produce incorrect results due to arithmetic or string manipulation issues.

Testing the program with various `k` values, including boundary conditions and large values, would confirm its correctness. However, based on the problem statement and the provided examples, the implementation appears to follow the requirements accurately.
