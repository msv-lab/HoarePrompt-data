Reasoning: 

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description, the provided examples, and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the \(k\)-th digit in the infinite sequence formed by concatenating all positive integers one after another.

2. **Function Summary**: The function iteratively checks the length of each integer starting from 1 and reduces \(k\) by the length of the integer once the integer length is sufficient to contain the \(k\)-th digit. It then prints the corresponding digit and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program initializes `n` to 1 and iterates through increasing values of `n`.
   - For each `n`, it converts `n` to a string `s`.
   - If the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints the \((k-1)\)-th character of `s` and exits the loop.
   - If the length of `s` is less than `k`, it subtracts the length of `s` from `k` and increments `n`.

Let's verify this step-by-step:

- **Example 1**: \( k = 7 \)
