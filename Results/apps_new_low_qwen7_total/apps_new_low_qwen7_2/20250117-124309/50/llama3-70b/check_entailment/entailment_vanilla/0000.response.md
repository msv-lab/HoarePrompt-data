Reasoning:
To solve this problem, the program attempts to find the exact number and digit that corresponds to the given `k` in the infinite sequence. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. It initializes `n` to 1, representing the current number being considered.
2. In each iteration of the loop, it converts the current number `n` to a string `s`.
3. If the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the desired digit is within the digits of `n`. The code then prints the `k`-th digit (considering 1-based indexing) and breaks out of the loop.
4. If the length of `s` is less than `k`, it subtracts the length of `s` from `k` and increments `n` to consider the next number in the sequence.
5. This process continues until the desired digit is found.

Given the constraints and the logic of the solution, let's test the program with the examples provided and consider the edge cases:

1. For `k = 7`, the program should output '7'. The sequence at positions 1 through 7 is "1234567", so the 7th digit is indeed '7'.
2. For `k = 21`, the program should output '5'. The sequence at positions 19 through 21 is "192021", and the 21st digit is '5'.

The logic seems sound, but we need to ensure it handles large values of `k` correctly and doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop or produce incorrect results due to arithmetic or string manipulation issues.

Testing the program with various `k` values, including boundary conditions and large values, would confirm its correctness. However, based on the problem statement and the provided examples, the implementation appears to follow the requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
