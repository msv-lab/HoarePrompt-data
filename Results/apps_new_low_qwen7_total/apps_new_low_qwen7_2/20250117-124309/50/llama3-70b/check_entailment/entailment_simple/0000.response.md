### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `k` from the input and stores it in the variable `n`. However, in the annotated program, it seems there might be a typo where `n` is used instead of `k` inside the function body. This should be corrected to `k`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues incrementing `n` until the condition `len(s) >= k` is met, where `s` is the string representation of `n`.
   - For each iteration, the length of the current number (`n`) is checked against `k`. If the length of the string `s` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints the `k`-th digit of `n` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `len(s)` is less than `k`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting `len(s)` from it, effectively moving `k` to the next digit to find. Then, `n` is incremented by 1 to check the next number.

3. **Termination Condition:**
   - The loop ensures that when the condition `len(s) >= k` is true, the correct digit is printed. The termination condition guarantees that the program will eventually find the required digit.

4. **Final State Analysis:**
   - The final state mentioned in the annotated program suggests `k` becomes 0, which indicates the correct digit has been found and the loop has exited. `n` being 10 and `s` being "10" suggests that the digit at position 7 (the 7th digit in the sequence) was found within the number 10.

Given the above points, the logic of the program appears to be correct and follows the requirements of the problem statement.
