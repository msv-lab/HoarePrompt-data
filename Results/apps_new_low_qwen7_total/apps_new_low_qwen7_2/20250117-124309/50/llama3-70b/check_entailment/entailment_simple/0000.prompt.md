Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...

Your task is to print the $k$-th digit of this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) â€” the position to process ($1$-based index).


-----Output-----

Print the $k$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
7

Input
21

Output
5

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12.
def func():
    k = int(input())

n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        
        k -= len(s)
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: k is 0, n is 10, s is "10".


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
