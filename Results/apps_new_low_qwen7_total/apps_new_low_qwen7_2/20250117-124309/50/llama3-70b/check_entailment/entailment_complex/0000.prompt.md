Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...

Your task is to print the $k$-th digit of this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) â€” the position to process ($1$-based index).


-----Output-----

Print the $k$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12.
def func():
    k = int(input())

n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        
        k -= len(s)
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: k is 0, n is 10, s is "10".
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `k` from the user, where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). It then finds the \((k-1)\)-th character of the smallest integer whose length is at least \(k\). If no such integer exists (which theoretically should not happen given the constraints), the function will eventually find an integer large enough to satisfy the condition. After finding the integer, it prints the \((k-1)\)-th character of that integer and terminates. The function ensures that \(k\) is reduced to 0 after finding the appropriate integer, and \(n\) is set to 10 at the end of the loop.
