### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed explanation of the program's logic and validates it with the given examples. Let's break down the program step-by-step and validate its correctness using logical reasoning and edge case analysis.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `k` from input.
   - It initializes `n` to 1, which represents the current number being considered in the sequence.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In each iteration, the current number `n` is converted to a string `s`.
   - The length of `s` is checked against `k`.
     - If `len(s) >= k`, the `k`-th digit (1-based index) of `n` is printed, and the loop is exited.
     - If `len(s) < k`, `k` is reduced by `len(s)`, and `n` is incremented by 1 to move to the next number in the sequence.

3. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - For small values of `k` like 7 and 21, the program correctly identifies the corresponding digit.
   - For larger values of `k`, the program correctly narrows down the range of numbers by adjusting `k` and incrementing `n`.

4. **Handling Large Values**:
   - The program uses a while loop that will terminate once the `k`-th digit is found. Since the sequence of digits is finite and the program adjusts `k` and increments `n` appropriately, it will not get stuck in an infinite loop.
   - The logic ensures that the program can handle very large values of `k` up to \(10^{12}\).

5. **Annotations and State Changes**:
   - The annotation shows that after the loop, `k` becomes 0, indicating that the desired digit was found within the last checked number.
   - The state changes are consistent with the logic described in the original assessment.

Based on the detailed reasoning and validation of the program, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly finds the `k`-th digit in the infinite sequence of concatenated positive integers.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
