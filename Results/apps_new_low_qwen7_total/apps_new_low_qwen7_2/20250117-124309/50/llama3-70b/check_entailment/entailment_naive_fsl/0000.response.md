Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the \( k \)-th digit in the concatenated sequence of all positive integers. The logic iterates through the numbers, checking the length of the string representation of each number to see if it contains the desired digit. When the required digit is found, it is printed, and the loop breaks. This approach works for any \( k \) within the given range, making the program correct according to the problem description.
