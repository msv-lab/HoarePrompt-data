You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...

Your task is to print the $k$-th digit of this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) — the position to process ($1$-based index).


-----Output-----

Print the $k$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input

Output

21

Output

- Program: 
def func():
    k = int(input())
    n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        k -= len(s)
        n += 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12.
def func():
    k = int(input())

n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        
        k -= len(s)
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: k is 0, n is 10, s is "10".
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `k` from the user, where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). It then finds the \((k-1)\)-th character of the smallest integer whose length is at least \(k\). If no such integer exists (which theoretically should not happen given the constraints), the function will eventually find an integer large enough to satisfy the condition. After finding the integer, it prints the \((k-1)\)-th character of that integer and terminates. The function ensures that \(k\) is reduced to 0 after finding the appropriate integer, and \(n\) is set to 10 at the end of the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the \( k \)-th digit in the concatenated sequence of all positive integers. The logic iterates through the numbers, checking the length of the string representation of each number to see if it contains the desired digit. When the required digit is found, it is printed, and the loop breaks. This approach works for any \( k \) within the given range, making the program correct according to the problem description.
