Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The given loop is a `while True` loop. This means the loop will always execute as long as the program state allows it, unless explicitly stopped.

2. **Variables Controlling the Loop Execution**: Since it's a `while True` loop, no variables inside the loop control its execution directly. Therefore, the initial state of the variables before entering the loop doesn't affect whether the loop will execute at least once.

3. **Initial State Before Loop**: The initial state right before the loop is that `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), and `n` is 1.

4. **Loop Execution**: Because the loop is `while True`, it will execute the first time regardless of the initial values of `k` and `n`.

Given this analysis, there is no specific adjustment needed for the variables to allow the loop to execute the first time since the loop will always run due to `while True`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), `n` is 1**
