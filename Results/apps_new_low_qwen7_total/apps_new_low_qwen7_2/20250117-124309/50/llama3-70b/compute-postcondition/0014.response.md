The first line `print(s[k - 1])` tries to access the character at index `k - 1` of the string `s`. Given the initial state where `k` is -2 and `s` is "3", the expression `k - 1` evaluates to -3. In Python, string indices start at 0, so -3 would refer to a position before the start of the string, which results in an `IndexError`.

However, since we are focusing on the final state and given that the code execution would stop due to the error, no further assignments or modifications occur. Therefore, the values of `k`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **k is -2, n is 3, s is "3"**
