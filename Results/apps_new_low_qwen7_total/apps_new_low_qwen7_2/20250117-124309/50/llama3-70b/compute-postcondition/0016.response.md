Initial State: `k` is -2, `n` is 3, `s` is "3"

```
k -= len(s)
n += 1
```

First, the line `k -= len(s)` subtracts the length of `s` from `k`. Since `s` is "3", its length is 1. Therefore, `k` becomes `-2 - 1`, which is `-3`.

Next, the line `n += 1` increments `n` by 1. Since `n` was originally 3, it now becomes `3 + 1`, which is `4`.

No other variables are affected by the code block.

Output State: **k is -3, n is 4**
