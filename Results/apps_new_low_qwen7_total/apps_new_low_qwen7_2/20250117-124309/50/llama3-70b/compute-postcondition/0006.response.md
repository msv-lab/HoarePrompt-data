Initial State: `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), `n` is 1, `s` is "1".

Code Block:
```
k -= len(s)
n += 1
```

Analysis:
- The length of `s` is 1 because `s` is initially "1".
- The first line `k -= len(s)` subtracts the length of `s` (which is 1) from `k`. This makes `k` one less than its original value.
- The second line `n += 1` increments `n` by 1, so `n` becomes 2.

Final State: `k` is now `k - 1`, `n` is 2, and `s` remains "1" since it is not modified by the code.

Output State: **k is k - 1, n is 2, s is "1"**
