Since the `while True` loop does not have any conditions based on variables, it will continue to execute indefinitely as long as there are no external factors to stop it. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`k` is -2, `n` is 3, `s` is "2"**
