`s` is assigned the value of `str(n)`. Given that `n` is 2, `s` will be updated to the string `"2"`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is referenced in its own update (which is invalid syntax and would raise an error), and the value of `n` remains 2.

Output State: **`k` is `k - 1`, `n` is 2, `s` is `"2"`**
