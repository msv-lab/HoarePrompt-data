Output State: **res is the return value of func_1(res, a), a is the return value of func_1(a, a), b is greater than 0 and b is now b right-shifted by 1**

Explanation:
- The first line `a = func_1(a, a)` updates the value of `a` to the return value of `func_1(a, a)`.
- The second line `b >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `b`, effectively dividing it by 2 and discarding the remainder. This modifies the value of `b` but does not affect `res` or `a` (except for the updated value of `a`).

Since the initial conditions state that `b` is greater than 0 and if `b & 1` is true, the postcondition remains as the one described in the if part, but after executing the code, `b` is right-shifted by 1. Therefore, the final state includes this change.
