Postcondition: ***`res` is the return value of `func_1(res, a)`, `a` is the return value of `func_1(a, a)`, and `b` must be greater than 0. If `b` is odd, the function continues with the current values of `res` and `a`. Since there is no else part, the function does not change `res` or `a` when `b` is even.***
