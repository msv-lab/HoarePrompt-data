Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts an integer `a` such that \(0 < a < 998244353\) and returns the value of `func_2(a, 998244351)`. There are no additional actions performed by `func_3` beyond calling `func_2` with the specified arguments. The function does not modify any variables outside its scope and does not have any side effects. The return value is solely dependent on the input `a` and the constant `998244351`.**

Given the annotations and the code, there are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities to consider. The function simply calls another function `func_2` with the appropriate arguments and returns the result. The constraints on `a` ensure that it remains within the specified range during the function's execution.
