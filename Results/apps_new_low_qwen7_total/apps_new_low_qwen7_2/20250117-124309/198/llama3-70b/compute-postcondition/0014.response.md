Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step to determine the output state after all executions of the loop have finished.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is `b > 0`, so the loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is positive. The operations inside the loop are:
- If `b` is odd (`b & 1`), update `res` using `func_1(res, a)`.
- Update `a` using `func_1(a, a)`.
- Right shift `b` by 1 (`b >>= 1`).

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: `b` is the only variable that changes in a predictable manner (right shift). Initially, `res` is set to 1, `a` is a non-negative integer, and `b` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- **Variables Updated During Loop**:
  - `res`: Updated when `b` is odd.
  - `a`: Updated to `func_1(a, a)` in each iteration.
  - `b`: Right shifted by 1 in each iteration.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- **Effect of `b & 1`**: When `b` is odd, `res` is updated to `func_1(res, a)`. This means `res` accumulates the result of multiplying `a` by itself `b` times using the `func_1` function.
- **Effect of `a = func_1(a, a)`**: `a` is updated to the square of itself in each iteration. This effectively squares the value of `a` each time the loop runs.
- **Effect of `b >>= 1`**: `b` is halved in each iteration, which means it reduces the number of times `a` needs to be multiplied by itself in the next iteration.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
After `b` becomes 0, the loop stops. At this point:
- `a` will be `a` raised to the power of 2, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^k where k is the number of times the loop ran.
- `res` will be the product of `a` multiplied by itself `b` times, starting from 1 and accumulating the result of `func_1(res, a)` when `b` is odd.

Given that `b` is initially a non-negative integer greater than 0, and it gets halved each time the loop runs, eventually `b` will become 0, and the loop will stop.

### Final Output State
After the loop finishes, `a` will be `a` raised to the power of 2^(number of times the loop ran), and `res` will be the result of `a` raised to the power of `b` (initial value of `b`).

Output State: **res is \( a^{b} \), a is \( a^{2^k} \) where \( k \) is the number of times the loop ran, b is 0.**
