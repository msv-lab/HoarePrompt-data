Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are non-negative integers with \( b > 0 \). The function calculates \( a^b \mod 998244353 \) using an efficient exponentiation by squaring algorithm. Specifically, it iteratively squares `a` and multiplies `res` by `a` when the least significant bit of `b` is 1. After the loop, it returns `res`, which is equivalent to \( a^b \mod 998244353 \). This process ensures that the intermediate values of `a` are always powers of 2 (i.e., \( a^{2^k} \)), where `k` is the number of iterations in the loop. The function handles the case where `b` is initially greater than 0 and reduces the problem size in each iteration until `b` becomes 0, at which point the final value of `res` is returned.**

**Potential edge cases include:**
- If `b` is 0, the function should theoretically return 1 (since any number to the power of 0 is 1). However, since the loop runs only when `b > 0`, the function currently returns the initial value of `res`, which is 1. This behavior is correct but worth noting.

**Missing functionality:**
- There is no explicit handling for the case where `b` is 0 before entering the loop. In practice, the loop condition `while b > 0:` ensures that the loop does not run if `b` is 0, but this could be more clearly stated in the annotations for clarity.
