The only variable in the loop head is `b`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` has been halved from its original value. For the loop to be executed one more time, `b` must be greater than 0.

To determine the exact condition, let's consider the following:

1. Initially, `b` was some value (let's call it `original_b`).
2. After the previous iteration, `b` is halved, meaning `b = original_b / 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must still be greater than 0. Therefore, `original_b / 2 > 0`, which implies `original_b > 0`.

Thus, we need to ensure that `b` is greater than 0.

State: **`res` is the return value of `func_1(1, a)` originally, `a` is the return value of `func_1(a, a)`, `b` must be greater than 0**
