The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, with \( b > 0 \). Additionally, `a` is assumed to be \( a^{2^k} \), where \( k \) is the number of times a loop ran.

The function returns `res`, which is calculated as \( a^b \mod 998244353 \).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is \( a^{2^k} \) and \( b \) is a positive integer, and return the result of \( a^b \mod 998244353 \).
