The only variable in the loop head is `b`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is greater than 0 and `b` is now `b` right-shifted by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must still be greater than 0 after the right shift.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `b` remains greater than 0 after the right shift.

State: **`res` is the return value of `func_1(res, a)`, `a` is the return value of `func_1(a, a)`, `b` must be greater than 0**
