The function `func_1(res, a)` is called with `res` being 1 and `a` being a non-negative integer. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only infer that `res` will be updated based on the parameters passed to `func_1`. However, the initial value of `res` is 1, and `a` is a non-negative integer.

Given that no specific details about `func_1` are provided, we can assume the following general behavior:

- If `func_1` returns a new value for `res`, that value will replace the old value of `res`.
- If `func_1` modifies `res` in place (which is common for functions in Python unless specified otherwise), the value of `res` would remain 1.

Since the exact operation inside `func_1` is not specified, we will assume the simplest case where `func_1` returns a new value for `res`.

Therefore, the output state will be:
Output State: **`res` is the return value of `func_1(1, a)`, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer with \( b > 0 \) and the current value of `b` is odd.**
