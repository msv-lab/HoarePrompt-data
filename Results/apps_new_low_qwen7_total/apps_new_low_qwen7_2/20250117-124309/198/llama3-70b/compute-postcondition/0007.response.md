The code updates the value of `res` to the return value of `func_1(res, a)`. However, since `func_1` itself is not defined and does not specify what it returns or how it operates, we cannot determine the exact new value of `res` without knowing the implementation of `func_1`. Therefore, the only changes made are that `res` is now the return value of `func_1(res, a)`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `res` is the return value of `func_1(1, a)`
- `a` is the return value of `func_1(a, a)`
- `b` must be greater than 0

After executing `res = func_1(res, a)`, the following is true:
- `res` is updated to the return value of `func_1(res, a)`
- `a` remains the return value of `func_1(a, a)`
- `b` remains greater than 0

Output State: **`res` is the return value of `func_1(res, a)`, `a` is the return value of `func_1(a, a)`, `b` is greater than 0**
