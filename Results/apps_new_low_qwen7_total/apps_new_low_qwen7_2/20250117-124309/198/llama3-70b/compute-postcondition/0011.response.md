`res` is the return value of `func_1(res, a)`, `a` is the return value of `func_1(a, a)`, and `b` must be greater than 0. The code updates `res` to be the return value of `func_1(res, a)`. However, since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `res` after the function call, but we know it will be the return value of `func_1(res, a)`. The state of `a` remains unchanged, and `b` is still greater than 0.

Output State: **`res` is the return value of `func_1(res, a)`, `a` is the return value of `func_1(a, a)`, `b` must be greater than 0**
