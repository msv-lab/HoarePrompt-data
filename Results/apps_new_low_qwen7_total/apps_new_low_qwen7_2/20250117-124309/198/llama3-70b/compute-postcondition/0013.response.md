Based on the given code snippet and the initial state, let's analyze the effects of each line:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `res` is the return value of `func_1(res, a)`
   - `a` is the return value of `func_1(a, a)`
   - `b` must be greater than 0. If `b` is odd, the function continues with the current values of `res` and `a`. Since there is no else part, the function does not change `res` or `a` when `b` is even.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `a = func_1(a, a)`: This line updates the value of `a` to the return value of `func_1(a, a)`.
   - `b >>= 1`: This line performs a bitwise right shift operation on `b`, effectively dividing `b` by 2 (and discarding any remainder).

Given the initial state, let's denote the return value of `func_1(res, a)` as `res_value` and the return value of `func_1(a, a)` as `a_value`.

After the first line, the state becomes:
- `a` is now `a_value`

After the second line, since `b` is right-shifted by 1, `b` becomes `b // 2`.

Combining these changes, the final output state is:
Output State: **`res` is res_value, `a` is a_value, `b` is b // 2**
