Given the initial state where `res` is the return value of `func_1(1, a)` (where `a` is a non-negative integer) and `b` is a non-negative integer with \( b > 0 \), and the behavior of `res` based on whether `b` is odd or even, we proceed to execute the provided code block:

```
a = func_1(a, a)
b >>= 1
```

### Analysis of Code Execution:

1. **First Line: `a = func_1(a, a)`**
   - This line updates the value of `a` by calling `func_1(a, a)`.
   - The exact value of `a` post-execution depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not specified. However, we know that `a` will be updated to whatever `func_1(a, a)` returns.

2. **Second Line: `b >>= 1`**
   - This bitwise right shift operation divides `b` by 2, effectively halving its value.

### Impact on Variables:
- **`a`**: Updated to the return value of `func_1(a, a)`.
- **`b`**: Halved (right-shifted by 1).

### Final Output State:
- `res` retains its original value, as the code block does not modify it.
- `a` is now the return value of `func_1(a, a)`.
- `b` is halved from its original value.

Since the specific values of `a` and `b` are not given and depend on the implementation of `func_1`, we express the final state in terms of these variables:

Output State: **res is the return value of func_1(1, a) originally, a is the return value of func_1(a, a), b is halved from its original value**
