Precondition: **a is an integer such that \(0 < a < 998244353\)**. 

Explanation: The function `func_3` is expected to compute the modular inverse of `a` modulo \(998244353\) and return it. The variable `MOD` is a constant set to \(998244353\), and the function `func_2` is assumed to compute \(a^{e}\) modulo \(MOD\) for some exponent \(e\). In this case, `func_2(a, MOD - 2)` computes \(a^{MOD-2} \mod MOD\), which is the modular inverse of `a` modulo \(998244353\).
