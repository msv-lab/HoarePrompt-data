The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both of which must satisfy \(0 \leq a, b < 998244353\), and returns the result of \((a * b) \% 998244353\). The function ensures that the product of `a` and `b` is taken modulo \(998244353\) to prevent overflow and to work within the specified range. There are no additional actions performed beyond the multiplication and modulo operation. The function handles the given constraints and performs the required computation accurately.
