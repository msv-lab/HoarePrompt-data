Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually implement the solution to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order. Instead, it defines three utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) for modular multiplication, exponentiation, and modular inverse, but does not use these functions to solve the problem.

To determine if there are no inversions, we need to check if the sequence of numbers of accepted solutions is non-decreasing. However, the provided code does not include any logic to generate or compare these sequences. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
