Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order. An inversion occurs if for any pair of problems \((x, y)\) where \(x < y\), the number of accepted solutions for problem \(y\) is strictly greater than that for problem \(x\).
   - For no inversions to occur, the number of accepted solutions for each problem must be in non-decreasing order.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program iterates through the list of intervals \([l_i, r_i]\) and calculates the probability of no inversions.
   - `func_1` multiplies two numbers modulo \(998244353\).
   - `func_2` computes \(a^b \mod 998244353\) using fast exponentiation.
   - `func_3` calculates \(a^{998244351} \mod 998244353\).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 1, which represents the overall probability.
   - It iterates over each problem \(i\) and calculates the number of ways to choose the number of accepted solutions such that the sequence is non-decreasing up to problem \(i\).
     - `cnt` is updated to include the number of valid choices for the next problem \(j\) that do not cause an inversion.
     - `func_1(res, cnt)` updates the probability.
   - After the first loop, it adjusts the probabilities for each problem to account for the possible range of accepted solutions.
     - `func_3(a[i][1] - a[i][0] + 1)` calculates the inverse of the range length modulo \(998244353\).
     - `func_1(res, func_3(a[i][1] - a[i][0] + 1))` updates the probability with this inverse.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly calculates the probability of having no inversions by ensuring that the number of accepted solutions for each problem is in non-decreasing order.
   - Each step in the program follows the logic needed to compute the desired probability.
   - The use of modular arithmetic and the correct implementation of exponentiation and inverses ensure that the calculations are accurate.
