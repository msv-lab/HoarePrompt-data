### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
   - For each problem, the number of accepted solutions is uniformly distributed between \( l_i \) and \( r_i \).
   - An inversion occurs if a problem \( x \) with more accepted solutions is placed before a problem \( y \) with fewer accepted solutions.

2. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The program iterates over pairs of problems to count how many ways \( y \)'s range can overlap with \( x \)'s range such that there is no inversion.
   - It uses a function `func_1` for modular multiplication.
   - It uses a function `func_2` for modular exponentiation, which is used to compute the modular inverse.
   - It uses a function `func_3` to compute the modular inverse of a number.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Performs modular multiplication \( (a \times b) \mod 998244353 \).
   - `func_2(a, b)`: Computes \( a^b \mod 998244353 \) using modular exponentiation.
   - `func_3(a)`: Computes the modular inverse of \( a \) using `func_2`.

4. **Program Flow:**
   - The main loop computes the number of valid permutations where no inversion occurs.
   - It multiplies the counts of valid ranges for each problem, using `func_1`.
   - After processing all problems, it further adjusts the result using `func_3` for each individual problem's range.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial logic.
   - It handles the constraints and uses appropriate modular arithmetic operations.
   - The use of modular inverses ensures that the final result is within the required range.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for calculating the probability of no inversions in the problem order.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
