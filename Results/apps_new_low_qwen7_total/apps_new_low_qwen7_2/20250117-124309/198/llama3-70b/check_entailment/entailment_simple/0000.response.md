Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic and verify it against the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - \(2 \leq n \leq 50\)
   - For each problem \(i\), the number of accepted solutions is between \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) (inclusive).
3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The probability that there are no inversions is calculated using combinatorial logic.
   - Each problem \(i\) can have any number of accepted solutions between \(l_i\) and \(r_i\).
   - We need to count the valid permutations of these solutions that do not form any inversions.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `MOD = 998244353`: This is used for modular arithmetic.
   - `n = int(input())`: Reads the number of problems.
   - `a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]`: Reads the ranges \([l_i, r_i]\) for each problem.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - `res = 1`: Initialize the result.
   - The outer loop runs from 0 to \(n-1\).
     - `cnt = 1`: Count of valid choices for the current problem.
     - Inner loop runs from \(i+1\) to \(n-1\).
       - If \(a[i][0] \leq a[j][1]\), it means the range of the current problem overlaps with the range of the next problem.
       - `cnt = func_1(cnt, a[j][1] - a[i][0] + 1)`: Update `cnt` using `func_1`.
     - `res = func_1(res, cnt)`: Update `res` using `func_1`.

3. **Additional Loop**:
   - Another loop runs from 0 to \(n-1\).
     - `res = func_1(res, func_3(a[i][1] - a[i][0] + 1))`: Update `res` using `func_3`.

### Function Definitions:
1. **func_1**:
   - Multiplies two numbers under modulo \(998244353\).

2. **func_2**:
   - Implements fast exponentiation using the binary exponentiation method.

3. **func_3**:
   - Computes the modular inverse of \(a\) using `func_2`.

### Verification:
1. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly computes the product under modulo \(998244353\).

2. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly implements fast exponentiation, returning \(a^b \mod 998244353\).

3. **Correctness of `func_3`**:
   - The function correctly computes the modular inverse of \(a\) using Fermat's Little Theorem.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The main loop ensures that for each problem, the count of valid choices is correctly updated.
   - The additional loop ensures that the final result is correctly computed using the modular inverses.

Given that the code correctly implements the required logic and functions, and the problem constraints are handled appropriately, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
