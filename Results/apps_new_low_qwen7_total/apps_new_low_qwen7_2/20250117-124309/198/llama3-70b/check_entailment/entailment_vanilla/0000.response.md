Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem statement and expected functionality.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the probability of having no inversions in the problem order. An inversion occurs if for any pair of problems \( (x, y) \) such that \( x < y \), the number of accepted solutions for \( y \) is strictly greater than the number of accepted solutions for \( x \). The input consists of intervals for each problem, and the output should be the probability that there are no inversions in the form of \( xy^{-1} \mod 998244353 \).

2. **Functions Analysis**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function performs multiplication modulo `MOD`. It is defined correctly.
   - `func_2(a, b)`: This function calculates \( a^b \mod MOD \) using the method of exponentiation by squaring, which is efficient for large exponents. However, this function does not seem to be used in the main logic of the problem.
   - `func_3(a)`: This function computes the modular inverse of `a` modulo `MOD` using the `func_2` function, which is also correct.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program is missing the main logic that calculates the probability of having no inversions. Given the functions defined, it appears that the program might be attempting to use modular inverses, but it lacks the necessary steps to compute the probability correctly.
   - The program does not implement the logic to count the valid sequences of accepted solutions for each problem that ensure no inversions. Instead, it seems to focus on computing modular inverses, which is not directly related to solving the problem as stated.

Since the program does not contain the logic to solve the given problem and instead focuses on computing modular inverses, it is not correct for the problem at hand.

Correctness: **False**
