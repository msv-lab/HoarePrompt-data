### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step and compare it with the problem description and the required logic.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
- An inversion occurs when for a pair of problems \((x, y)\) with \(x < y\), the number of accepted solutions for \(y\) is strictly greater than the number of accepted solutions for \(x\).
- The number of accepted solutions for each problem \(i\) ranges from \(l_i\) to \(r_i\).

#### Key Observations from the Annotated Code:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - `n` is the number of problems.
   - `a` is a list of lists containing the minimum and maximum number of accepted solutions for each problem.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - The first loop iterates over each problem \(i\).
     - For each problem \(i\), it counts how many other problems \(j\) (where \(j > i\)) have a number of accepted solutions that is less than or equal to \(a[i][0]\).
     - This count is stored in `cnt`.
   - The result `res` is updated by multiplying the previous result with `cnt`.

3. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The second loop calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible configurations for each problem and multiplies it into `res`.

4. **Utility Functions:**
   - `func_1` performs modular multiplication.
   - `func_2` computes modular exponentiation using the method of repeated squaring.
   - `func_3` computes the modular inverse using `func_2`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Correctness of Utility Functions:**
   - The utility functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are implemented correctly and are used appropriately within the main logic.
   - They handle the necessary modular arithmetic operations required for the problem.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The first loop correctly counts the number of valid configurations for each problem \(i\) (i.e., the number of problems \(j\) such that \(a[j][1] \leq a[i][0]\)).
   - This count is used to compute the product of the probabilities for each problem configuration, ensuring that the sequence remains non-decreasing.

3. **Final Result Calculation:**
   - The second loop calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible configurations for each problem and multiplies it into `res`, ensuring that the final result is correctly normalized.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the probability of having no inversions in the problem order. It uses the defined utility functions to perform the necessary modular arithmetic operations and correctly handles the counting and normalization steps.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
