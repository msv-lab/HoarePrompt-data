Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order, where each problem's number of accepted solutions is uniformly distributed between \(l_i\) and \(r_i\).

### Code Analysis
The provided code consists of three utility functions:
1. **func_1**: Performs modular multiplication.
2. **func_2**: Implements exponentiation using a fast exponentiation algorithm.
3. **func_3**: Returns the modular inverse of \(a\) modulo \(998244353\) by calling `func_2(a, MOD - 2)`.

These functions are correctly defined and do not have any issues in their implementation. However, the main program does not contain any logic to solve the actual problem.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summaries provided do not contradict the original assessment. They confirm that the functions are implemented correctly and only perform modular arithmetic operations.

### Correctness of the Assessment
The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The code focuses on modular arithmetic utilities but does not incorporate the necessary steps to calculate the probability of having no inversions.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The program does not solve the given problem.

Final: **False**
