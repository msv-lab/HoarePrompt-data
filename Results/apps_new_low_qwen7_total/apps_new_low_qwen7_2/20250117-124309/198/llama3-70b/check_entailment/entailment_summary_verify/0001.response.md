### Reasoning

Let's re-examine the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order. An inversion occurs if for any pair of problems \( (x, y) \) such that \( x < y \), the number of accepted solutions for \( y \) is strictly greater than the number of accepted solutions for \( x \).
   - The input consists of intervals \([l_i, r_i]\) for each problem, representing the range of possible accepted solutions.
   - The output should be the probability that there are no inversions, expressed as \(xy^{-1} \mod 998244353\).

2. **Function Summaries**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Performs multiplication modulo `MOD`.
   - `func_2(a, b)`: Calculates \(a^b \mod MOD\) using exponentiation by squaring.
   - `func_3(a)`: Computes the modular inverse of `a` modulo `MOD` using `func_2`.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code does not include the main logic to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the counting of valid sequences of accepted solutions for each problem that ensure no inversions.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are correct for their intended purposes, but they are not used in a way that solves the problem.
   - The original assessment is accurate in noting that the program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as stated. The program focuses on computing modular inverses, which is not relevant to the problem of counting non-inverting sequences.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not implement the required logic to calculate the probability of having no inversions in the problem order.
