The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are non-negative integers with \( b > 0 \). The function calculates \( a^b \mod 998244353 \) using an efficient exponentiation by squaring algorithm. Specifically, it iteratively squares `a` and multiplies `res` by `a` when the least significant bit of `b` is 1. After the loop, it returns `res`, which is equivalent to \( a^b \mod 998244353 \). This process ensures that the intermediate values of `a` are always powers of 2 (i.e., \( a^{2^k} \)), where `k` is the number of iterations in the loop. The function handles the case where `b` is initially greater than 0 and reduces the problem size in each iteration until `b` becomes 0, at which point the final value of `res` is returned.
