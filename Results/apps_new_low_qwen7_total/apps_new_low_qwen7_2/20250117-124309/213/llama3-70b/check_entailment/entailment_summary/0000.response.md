Reasoning:
The provided program iterates through each possible substring of the input number `n` by removing exactly one digit at a time. For each iteration, it constructs a new number without the current digit and checks if this new number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros. If such a number is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the new number and exits. If no valid number is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

The logic of the program correctly follows the problem statement:
1. It checks every possible single-digit removal.
2. It ensures the resulting number is divisible by 8.
3. It ensures the resulting number does not have leading zeros.
4. It prints "NO" if no valid number is found.

Given that the program adheres to the requirements and correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
