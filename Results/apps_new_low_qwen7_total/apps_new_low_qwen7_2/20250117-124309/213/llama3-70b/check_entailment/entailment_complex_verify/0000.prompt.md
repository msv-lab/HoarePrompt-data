You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a non-negative integer n, its decimal representation consists of at most 100 digits and doesn't contain leading zeroes.

Your task is to determine if it is possible in this case to remove some of the digits (possibly not remove any digit at all) so that the result contains at least one digit, forms a non-negative integer, doesn't have leading zeroes and is divisible by 8. After the removing, it is forbidden to rearrange the digits.

If a solution exists, you should print it.


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains a non-negative integer n. The representation of number n doesn't contain any leading zeroes and its length doesn't exceed 100 digits. 


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without quotes), if there is no such way to remove some digits from number n. 

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the resulting number after removing digits from number n in the second line. The printed number must be divisible by 8.

If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3454

Output
YES
344

Input
10

Output
YES
0

Input
111111

Output
NO

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
        if new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0':
            print('YES')
            print(new_n)
            exit()
    print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer represented as a string, with at most 100 digits and no leading zeroes.
def func():
    n = int(input())

digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
        
        if new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0':
            print('YES')
            print(new_n)
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The output state is as follows: `i` is equal to `len(digits)`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations. The variable `new_n` is never explicitly stored outside the loop, but its calculation happens within the loop for each iteration. The variable `digits` remains unchanged throughout the loop. The loop prints 'YES' and the corresponding `new_n` if it finds a valid number, otherwise it exits without further changes to the state.
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer represented as a string `n`. It checks if there is any substring of `n` (formed by removing exactly one digit) that is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros. If such a substring is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the number formed by removing that digit and exits. If no such substring is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the result through print statements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the original number itself is divisible by 8. For example, consider the input `8`. According to the problem description, the output should be:

```
YES
8
```

However, the current implementation does not check if the original number `n` is divisible by 8 before attempting to remove digits. As a result, it will skip checking the original number and only consider numbers formed by removing digits. Therefore, for inputs like `8`, the program will incorrectly print `NO`.
