Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the original number itself is divisible by 8. For example, consider the input `8`. According to the problem description, the output should be:

```
YES
8
```

However, the current implementation does not check if the original number `n` is divisible by 8 before attempting to remove digits. As a result, it will skip checking the original number and only consider numbers formed by removing digits. Therefore, for inputs like `8`, the program will incorrectly print `NO`.
