Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input as an integer `n` and converts it into a list of digits `digits`. This step is correct.

2. **Loop Execution**: The program iterates over each digit in `digits` and removes that digit to form a new number `new_n`. It checks if the new number `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros. If such a number is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number and exits the program.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Case 0 (n = 0)**: If the original number `n` is 0, the program will directly check if `new_n` can be 0 (which is divisible by 8) and will correctly print "YES 0".
   - **Case with Leading Zeros**: Since the original number `n` cannot have leading zeros, removing any digit except the first one will not create a number with leading zeros.
   - **Case with Multiple Solutions**: The program will print the first valid solution it finds. However, since the problem statement allows printing any valid solution, this is acceptable.

4. **Final Check**: If the loop completes without finding a valid `new_n`, the program correctly prints "NO".

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
