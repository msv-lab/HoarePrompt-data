Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. **Converting to Digits**: It converts the integer `n` into a list of its digits.
3. **Iterating Through Digits**: It iterates through each digit position, creating a new number by excluding the current digit.
4. **Checking Divisibility and Leading Zeros**: For each new number formed, it checks if the number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros.
5. **Printing Result**: If a valid number is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number and exits.
6. **No Valid Number Found**: If no valid number is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

This approach has a few issues:
- **Excluding Each Digit Individually**: The program excludes only one digit at a time, which might miss combinations where more than one digit can be excluded to form a valid number.
- **Leading Zeroes Check**: The check for leading zeroes only happens when forming the new number, but the output needs to ensure there are no leading zeroes after all exclusions.
- **Multiple Valid Solutions**: The program only prints the first valid number it finds, but it does not guarantee that the solution is the smallest possible valid number.

However, the primary issue is that the program does not consider combinations of digits being removed together. A more comprehensive approach would need to generate all possible subsets of digits and check their divisibility by 8.

Given the current logic, the program will fail for cases where multiple digits can be removed to form a valid number, and it may not find the smallest valid number.

Correctness: **False**
