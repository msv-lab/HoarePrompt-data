Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly describes the logic to check if a non-negative integer can be modified by removing one digit to form a number divisible by 8 without leading zeros.
- The program iterates over each digit in the number, excluding it one by one and checking if the resulting number meets the criteria.
- If a valid number is found, it immediately prints "YES" followed by the number and exits, which is correct behavior.
- If no valid number is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO", which is also correct.
- The program handles the constraints mentioned in the problem statement (no leading zeros, at most 100 digits).
- There are no logical errors in the provided code based on the problem description and the logic described.

Correctness: **True**
