You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a non-negative integer n, its decimal representation consists of at most 100 digits and doesn't contain leading zeroes.

Your task is to determine if it is possible in this case to remove some of the digits (possibly not remove any digit at all) so that the result contains at least one digit, forms a non-negative integer, doesn't have leading zeroes and is divisible by 8. After the removing, it is forbidden to rearrange the digits.

If a solution exists, you should print it.


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains a non-negative integer n. The representation of number n doesn't contain any leading zeroes and its length doesn't exceed 100 digits. 


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without quotes), if there is no such way to remove some digits from number n. 

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the resulting number after removing digits from number n in the second line. The printed number must be divisible by 8.

If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3454

Output
YES
344

Input
10

Output
YES
0

Input
111111

Output
NO

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
        if new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0':
            print('YES')
            print(new_n)
            exit()
    print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer represented as a string, with at most 100 digits and no leading zeroes.
def func():
    n = int(input())

digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
        
        if new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0':
            print('YES')
            print(new_n)
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The output state is as follows: `i` is equal to `len(digits)`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations. The variable `new_n` is never explicitly stored outside the loop, but its calculation happens within the loop for each iteration. The variable `digits` remains unchanged throughout the loop. The loop prints 'YES' and the corresponding `new_n` if it finds a valid number, otherwise it exits without further changes to the state.
    print('NO')



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. **Converting to Digits**: It converts the integer `n` into a list of its digits.
3. **Iterating Through Digits**: It iterates through each digit position, creating a new number by excluding the current digit.
4. **Checking Divisibility and Leading Zeros**: For each new number formed, it checks if the number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros.
5. **Printing Result**: If a valid number is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number and exits.
6. **No Valid Number Found**: If no valid number is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

This approach has a few issues:
- **Excluding Each Digit Individually**: The program excludes only one digit at a time, which might miss combinations where more than one digit can be excluded to form a valid number.
- **Leading Zeroes Check**: The check for leading zeroes only happens when forming the new number, but the output needs to ensure there are no leading zeroes after all exclusions.
- **Multiple Valid Solutions**: The program only prints the first valid number it finds, but it does not guarantee that the solution is the smallest possible valid number.

However, the primary issue is that the program does not consider combinations of digits being removed together. A more comprehensive approach would need to generate all possible subsets of digits and check their divisibility by 8.

Given the current logic, the program will fail for cases where multiple digits can be removed to form a valid number, and it may not find the smallest valid number.
