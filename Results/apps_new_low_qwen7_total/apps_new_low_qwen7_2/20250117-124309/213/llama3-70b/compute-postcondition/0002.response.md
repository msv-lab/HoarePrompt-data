The code `new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))` is executed under the condition that `i` is 0 and `len(digits)` must be at least 1. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. The slice `digits[:i]` will be `digits[:0]`, which is an empty list because `i` is 0.
2. The slice `digits[i + 1:]` will be `digits[1:]` because `i` is 0.
3. Concatenating these slices gives `[] + digits[1:]`.
4. The `map(str, ...)` function applies `str` to each element in `digits[1:]`, converting them to strings.
5. `''.join(...)` concatenates these string elements without any separator.
6. `int(...)` converts the resulting string back into an integer.

Since `i` is 0, the first part of the list (`digits[:i]`) is empty, and only the elements from `digits[1:]` are considered. Therefore, `new_n` will be the integer formed by concatenating the digits starting from the second element of `digits`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `len(digits)` must be at least 1, `new_n` is the integer formed by concatenating the digits from `digits[1:]`.**
