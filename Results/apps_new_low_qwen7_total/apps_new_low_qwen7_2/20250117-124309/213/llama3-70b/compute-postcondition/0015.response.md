The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO'. It does not affect the values of any variables. The previous state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(digits)`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations. The variable `new_n` is never explicitly stored outside the loop, but its calculation happens within the loop for each iteration. The variable `digits` remains unchanged throughout the loop. The loop prints 'NO' instead of 'YES' and the corresponding `new_n`.**
