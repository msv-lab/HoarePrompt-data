Initial State: `i` is 2, `new_n` is an integer formed by concatenating the digits of `digits` except the digit at index 2, and `digits` remains unchanged.
```

```
print('YES')
print(new_n)
exit()
```

The first line `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' but does not affect any variables. The second line `print(new_n)` prints the value of `new_n` but does not modify it. The `exit()` function call ends the program execution without changing any further variables.

Since no variables are modified by these lines of code, the final state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **i is 2, new_n is an integer formed by concatenating the digits of digits except the digit at index 2, and digits remains unchanged**.
