The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer represented as a string, with at most 100 digits and no leading zeroes. Based on the provided output cases, the function does not return any specific value but rather describes different scenarios. However, following the given format:

Case_1: The function accepts a parameter `n` (a non-negative integer represented as a string). If `n` is not a valid non-negative integer string, the function returns an error message. 
Case_2: If `n` is a valid non-negative integer string, the function returns a value based on additional conditions not provided in the snippet.

Since no specific return values are given beyond the validity check, we focus on the parameter and its constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer represented as a string. It returns an error message if `n` is not a valid non-negative integer string.**
