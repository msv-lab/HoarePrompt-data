Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `new_n` is an integer formed by concatenating the digits of `digits` except the digit at index 2, and `digits` remains unchanged. If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', these conditions hold. Otherwise, these conditions also hold since there is no else part changing the state.**
