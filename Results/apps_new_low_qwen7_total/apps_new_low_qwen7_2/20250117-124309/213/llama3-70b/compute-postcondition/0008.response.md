Output State: **i is 1, new_n is an integer formed by concatenating the digits of digits except the digit at index 1, digits remains unchanged**

Explanation:
- The first line `print('YES')` prints "YES" but does not modify any variables.
- The second line `print(new_n)` prints the value of `new_n` but does not modify any variables.
- The `exit()` function ends the program execution immediately without modifying any variables or performing additional operations.

Since the code simply prints values and then exits, it does not change the initial state of the variables `i`, `new_n`, and `digits`. Therefore, the final state remains the same as the initial state.
