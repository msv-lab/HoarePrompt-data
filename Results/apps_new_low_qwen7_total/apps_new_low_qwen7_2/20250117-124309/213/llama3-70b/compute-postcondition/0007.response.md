`i` is initially set to 1, and `digits` is a list whose length is at least 1. The code creates a new number `new_n` by removing the digit at index `i` from `digits`. Since `i` is 1, it removes the second digit (index starts from 0) from `digits`.

Let's assume `digits` is `['1', '2', '3']` for clarity. The code would then create `new_n` by removing `'2'` from `digits`, resulting in `new_n = '13'`.

In general, the new number `new_n` is formed by concatenating the digits before index `i` and after index `i` from the list `digits`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `new_n` is an integer formed by concatenating the digits of `digits` except the digit at index 1; `digits` remains unchanged.**
