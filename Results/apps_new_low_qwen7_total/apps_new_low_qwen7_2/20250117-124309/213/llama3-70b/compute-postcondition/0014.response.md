Output State: **The output state is as follows: `i` is equal to `len(digits)`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations. The variable `new_n` is never explicitly stored outside the loop, but its calculation happens within the loop for each iteration. The variable `digits` remains unchanged throughout the loop. The loop prints 'YES' and the corresponding `new_n` if it finds a valid number, otherwise it exits without further changes to the state.**

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `digits`.
   - For each index `i`, it forms a new integer `new_n` by removing the digit at index `i` from `digits`.
   - It checks if `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0'.
   - If the condition is met, it prints 'YES' and `new_n`, then exits the program.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` increments with each iteration, starting from 0 and ending at `len(digits) - 1`.
   - `new_n` is recalculated in each iteration based on the current value of `i`.
   - `digits` remains unchanged throughout the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue until either it finds a valid `new_n` or it has iterated through all indices of `digits`.
   - If a valid `new_n` is found, the loop prints 'YES' and the corresponding `new_n`, then exits.
   - If no valid `new_n` is found after iterating through all indices, the loop will complete without printing anything.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, it will eventually reach `len(digits) - 1`.
   - After this, the loop condition (`i < len(digits)`) fails, and the loop terminates.
   - The variable `digits` remains unchanged, and `new_n` is only used for checking the divisibility condition.

Thus, after the loop finishes, the final state is:
- `i` is equal to `len(digits)`.
- `digits` remains unchanged.
- `new_n` is never stored, but its last computed value would have been the one checked in the last iteration if a valid `new_n` was found.
