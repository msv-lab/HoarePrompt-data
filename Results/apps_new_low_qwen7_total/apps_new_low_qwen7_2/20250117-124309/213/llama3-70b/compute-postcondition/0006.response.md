Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `len(digits)` is at least 1
   - `new_n` is the integer formed by concatenating the digits from `digits[1:]`.
   - If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', `new_n` is printed and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(len(digits))`, meaning it starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 each time until `i` is less than `len(digits)`.

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(digits)`.

4. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(digits)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `len(digits)` is at least 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - Since `len(digits)` remains unchanged, `len(digits)` must still be at least 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `len(digits)` must remain at least 1.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `len(digits)` must be at least 1

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `len(digits)` is at least 1**
