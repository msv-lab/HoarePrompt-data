Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(digits))`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `new_n` is an integer formed by concatenating the digits of `digits` except the digit at index 1
   - `digits` remains unchanged

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue if `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `len(digits)`, the variable `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - `new_n` will be formed by concatenating the digits of `digits` except the digit at index 2.
   - `digits` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new state should reflect these adjustments.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `new_n` is an integer formed by concatenating the digits of `digits` except the digit at index 2, and `digits` remains unchanged.**
