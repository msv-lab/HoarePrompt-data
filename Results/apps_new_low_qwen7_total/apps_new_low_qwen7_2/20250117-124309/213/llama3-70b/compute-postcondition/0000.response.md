Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, with at most 100 digits and no leading zeroes.

Code Block:
```
n = int(input())
digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
```

Analysis:
1. The first line reads an integer value from input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `n` is initially a string, the `int()` function converts this string to an integer.
2. The second line creates a list called `digits` by converting each character (digit) of the string representation of `n` into an integer and then into a list.

Final Output State: **n is an integer, digits is a list of integers where each element is a digit of n**
