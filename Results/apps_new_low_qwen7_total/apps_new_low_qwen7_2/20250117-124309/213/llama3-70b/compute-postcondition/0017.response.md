Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer represented as a string `n`. It checks if there is any substring of `n` (formed by removing exactly one digit) that is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros. If such a substring is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the number formed by removing that digit and exits. If no such substring is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the result through print statements.**

Potential edge cases:
- If the input string `n` is empty or contains only one digit, the function will not find any valid substring and will print 'NO'.
- If the input string `n` consists entirely of digits that do not form any number divisible by 8 when any single digit is removed, the function will print 'NO'.

Missing functionality:
- The current code does not handle the case where `n` is a single digit. In such a case, no valid substring can be formed, and the function should print 'NO'. This is already covered in the edge case mentioned above.
