Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop uses `i` as the index variable, and it iterates over the length of the `digits` list. 

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(digits)`. 

3. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer (though its value is not directly relevant to the loop's execution).
   - `digits` is a list of integers, where each element is a digit of `n`.

4. **First Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the valid range such that `i < len(digits)`.

5. **Initial Values**:
   - Since this is the first iteration, `i` should be set to 0.
   - The condition `i < len(digits)` must be satisfied. Therefore, `len(digits)` must be at least 1.

6. **Final Adjustment**: 
   - `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `len(digits)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

Based on these points, the state for the first execution of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 0, `len(digits)` must be at least 1**
