Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `new_n` is an integer formed by concatenating the digits of `digits` except the digit at index 1, and `digits` remains unchanged. If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', the function continues with the current state. Otherwise, the function continues with the current state.***
