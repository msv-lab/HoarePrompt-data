The function accepts a non-negative integer represented as a string `n`. It checks if there is any substring of `n` (formed by removing exactly one digit) that is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros. If such a substring is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the number formed by removing that digit and exits. If no such substring is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the result through print statements.
