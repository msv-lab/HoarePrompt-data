### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and function summary in detail to validate the original assessment.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - However, the actual implementation of the function does not directly follow this summary. Instead, it iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to check if they satisfy the condition \(2(a + b) = n\) and \(a \neq b\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The outer loop runs from `1` to `n // 2`. This ensures that `a` is always less than or equal to half of `n`.
   - The inner loop runs from `a` to \(\frac{n - a}{2}\). This ensures that `b` is greater than or equal to `a` and less than or equal to half of the remaining length after subtracting `a` from `n`.
   - The condition `if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:` checks if `a` and `b` are different and their sum is half of `n`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, `ways` is incremented.

3. **Behavior Verification**:
   - For the first example, `n = 6`. The possible valid pairs are \((1, 2)\) since \(2(1 + 2) = 6\). There is only one valid pair, which matches the expected output of `1`.
   - For the second example, `n = 20`. The valid pairs are \((1, 9)\), \((2, 8)\), and \((3, 7)\), and \((4, 6)\). There are four valid pairs, which matches the expected output of `4`.

4. **Function Summary Mismatch**:
   - The function summary states that the function calculates the number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - However, the actual implementation checks if \(2(a + b) = n\) and \(a \neq b\), which means it checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is exactly half of `n` and not equal, rather than checking if \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\).

Given the mismatch between the function summary and the actual implementation, the original assessment might be slightly misleading.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

**Explanation**: The original assessment incorrectly describes the function summary. The actual implementation checks \(2(a + b) = n\) instead of \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\), which aligns with the correct logic for forming a rectangle with four parts of the stick. The function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, so the original assessment should be maintained.
