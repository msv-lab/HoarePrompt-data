You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.

- Program:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which must be a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^9\). The function calculates the number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a \neq b\). The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the value \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
- The problem requires counting the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that the parts can form a rectangle but not a square.
- A rectangle can be formed if two pairs of opposite sides are equal, i.e., if we have lengths `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that `a == c` and `b == d` and `a != b`.
- The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to find valid splits.
- For each valid split, the code checks if the sum of `a` and `b` equals half the total length `n/2` and ensures `a` is not equal to `b` to prevent forming a square.
- The loop constraints ensure that all parts are positive integers and the conditions for forming a rectangle but not a square are met.
- The given code logic correctly identifies the valid splits and increments the `ways` counter accordingly.

Based on the above reasoning, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
