### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- We need to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that the parts can form a rectangle but not a square.
- A rectangle requires two pairs of equal sides, while a square requires all four sides to be equal.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` calculates the number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a \neq b\).
- The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the value \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Loop Over Possible Values:**
   ```python
   for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
       for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
           if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
               ways += 1
   ```
   - The outer loop iterates over possible values of `a`.
   - The inner loop iterates over possible values of `b` such that \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\).
   - The condition `a != b` ensures that the parts are different.
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the total length of the parts equals `n`.

2. **Returning the Result:**
   ```python
   return ways
   ```
   - The function returns the number of valid ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

#### Validating Against Examples:
- **Example Input: `n = 6`**
  - The valid way is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`.
  - The program correctly outputs `1`.

- **Example Input: `n = 20`**
  - Valid ways include `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`.
  - The program correctly outputs `4`.

#### Checking the Summary:
- The summary states that the function calculates the number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a \neq b\), and returns \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).
- However, this summary is misleading because the actual logic within the function correctly ensures that the parts can form a rectangle but not a square.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly identifies pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a \neq b\).
- It correctly excludes the case where all four parts are equal, ensuring that no configuration can form a square.
- The final result returned by the function is indeed the correct count of valid ways to split the stick.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis and the examples, the original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly handles the conditions required to form a rectangle but not a square.

**Final: True**
