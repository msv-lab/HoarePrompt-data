### Reasoning:

Let's carefully review the given program and the annotated code to understand why the original assessment is incorrect.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:

1. **Input and Function Call:**
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   print(func_1(n))
   ```
   Here, the user inputs a value for `n`, and the function `func_1` is called with this value.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       ways = 0
       for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
           for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
               if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                   ways += 1
       return ways
   ```

   - The loop iterates over possible values of `a` and `b`.
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the sum of `a` and `b` is half of `n`.
   - The condition `a != b` ensures that the two parts are different, making it possible to form a rectangle (since opposite sides of a rectangle must be equal, but not all four sides must be the same).

3. **Annotated Code Explanation:**
   - The program checks all pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b == n/2` and `a != b`.
   - It counts these pairs, ensuring that the remaining parts (which are determined by `c` and `d` such that `c = n - a - b` and `d = n - a - c`) also meet the conditions to form a rectangle but not a square.

4. **Guaranteeing No Square Formation:**
   - Since `a` and `b` are different, the remaining parts `c` and `d` will also be different (as they are determined by `c = n - a - b` and `d = n - a - c`), ensuring that no four parts are equal.
   - This logic correctly guarantees that the parts cannot form a square while forming a rectangle.

### Verification:

- **Input `6`:**
  - Possible pairs: `(1, 2)`, `(1, 3)`, `(2, 2)` (but excluded since `a != b`).
  - Valid pairs: `(1, 2)` results in `{1, 1, 2, 2}` (a rectangle but not a square).

- **Input `20`:**
  - Possible pairs: `(1, 9)`, `(2, 8)`, `(3, 7)`, `(4, 6)`, `(5, 5)` (but excluded since `a != b`).
  - Valid pairs: `(1, 9)`, `(2, 8)`, `(3, 7)`, `(4, 6)` result in `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, `{4, 4, 6, 6}` (all rectangles but not squares).

The program correctly identifies and counts all valid ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not correctly handle the condition that the four parts should not be able to form a square. The program actually does handle this correctly by ensuring `a != b` and thereby ensuring that no four parts are equal.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
