### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and its annotated version to verify the original assessment.

#### Key Points of the Original Assessment:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The program aims to count the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that these parts can form a rectangle but not a square.
2. **Rectangle Formation**: For the parts to form a rectangle, the lengths must come in pairs of equal lengths, i.e., `a == c` and `b == d`.
3. **Loop Constraints**: The loops ensure that `a` and `b` are distinct and their sum is half of `n`, ensuring no square formation.
4. **Counting Valid Ways**: The `ways` variable is incremented each time a valid pair `(a, b)` is found.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input and Function Call**:
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   print(func_1(n))
   ```
   - `n` is read from input, and the function `func_1` is called with `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       ways = 0
       for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
           for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
               if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                   ways += 1
       return ways
   ```

   - `ways` is initialized to 0.
   - The outer loop runs `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.
   - The inner loop runs `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` checks if `a` and `b` can form half the length of the stick, ensuring `a + b` sums to `n / 2`.
   - The condition `a != b` ensures the parts are distinct, preventing square formation.

3. **Loop Behavior**:
   - For each valid pair `(a, b)`, the sum `a + b` must equal `n / 2`, and `a` must not equal `b`.
   - If these conditions are met, `ways` is incremented.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles even and odd values of `n`. For odd `n`, no valid pairs exist because `a + b` cannot be an integer when divided by 2.
   - For even `n`, the loops correctly identify all valid pairs.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns `ways`, which is the count of valid ways to split the stick.

#### Verification Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code correctly explains the behavior of the loops and the conditions checked.
- The final value of `ways` is calculated correctly based on the valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the program's logic and the conditions it checks to ensure the parts form a rectangle but not a square. The program correctly implements the solution as per the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
