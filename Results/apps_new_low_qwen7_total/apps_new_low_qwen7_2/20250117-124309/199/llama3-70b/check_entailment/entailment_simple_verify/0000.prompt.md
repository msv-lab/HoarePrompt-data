You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.

- Program: 
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given Python loop and its behavior step by step.
    #
    #### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
    #The loop iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` within specified ranges, checking if the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) holds and \(a \neq b\). The variable `ways` is incremented each time this condition is met.
    #
    #### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
    #- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains constant throughout the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.
    #- **`ways`**: This variable starts at 0 and is incremented each time the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\) is satisfied.
    #- **`a` and `b`**: These variables take on values within their respective ranges during each iteration but are not stored outside the loop for future use.
    #
    #### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
    #The loop checks every possible pair \((a, b)\) where \(a\) ranges from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2}\) and \(b\) ranges from \(a\) to \(\frac{n - a}{2}\). It increments `ways` if \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
    #
    #### Step 4: Verify Relationships
    #- The loop will execute if \(n\) is even, because for odd \(n\), there can't be a pair \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).
    #- For even \(n\), the loop will iterate through all valid pairs \((a, b)\) until it finds all pairs that satisfy the condition.
    #
    #### Final Output State Calculation
    #To find the final value of `ways`, we need to determine all pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
    #
    #Since \(2 \times (a + b) == n\), it simplifies to \(a + b == \frac{n}{2}\). We need to count all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a < b \leq \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a + b == \frac{n}{2}\).
    #
    #For each valid \(a\), there is exactly one corresponding \(b\) such that \(b = \frac{n}{2} - a\) and \(a \neq b\). Therefore, the number of valid pairs is half the number of integers from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2}\), minus one (to exclude the case where \(a = b\)).
    #
    #Thus, the number of valid pairs is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\frac{n}{2}}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #Output State: `ways` is equal to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).
    return ways
    #`ways` is equal to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that the four parts should not be able to form a square. Specifically, the program checks if `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, which ensures that the parts can form a rectangle but does not guarantee that they cannot form a square. For instance, consider the input `20`. The program would output `4`, but one of the valid ways to split the stick is `{5, 5, 5, 5}`, which forms a square. This violates the requirement that no configuration should be able to form a square.

A correct approach would ensure that the four parts cannot all be equal. The program should exclude cases where all four parts are the same value.
