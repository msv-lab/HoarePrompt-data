### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to count the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that these parts can form a rectangle but not a square.
- A rectangle can be formed if we have two pairs of opposite sides equal, i.e., if we have lengths `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that `a == c` and `b == d` and `a != b`.

#### Program Analysis:
- The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to find valid splits.
- For each valid split, the code checks if the sum of `a` and `b` equals half the total length `n/2` and ensures `a` is not equal to `b` to prevent forming a square.
- The loop constraints ensure that all parts are positive integers and the conditions for forming a rectangle but not a square are met.

#### Detailed Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   ways = 0
   for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
       for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
           if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
               ways += 1
   ```

2. **Inner Loop Analysis:**
   - `a` ranges from `1` to `n // 2`.
   - `b` ranges from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that `a + b == n / 2`.
   - The condition `a != b` ensures that the parts do not form a square.

3. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - For each valid pair \((a, b)\), the code increments `ways`.
   - The nested loops ensure that all pairs \((a, b)\) where `a + b == n / 2` and `a != b` are checked.

4. **Ensuring Rectangle Formation:**
   - If \(a + b == n / 2\) and \(a \neq b\), then the remaining parts `c` and `d` must also satisfy `c == a` and `d == b` to form a rectangle.
   - The condition `a != b` prevents forming a square, ensuring the parts can form a rectangle but not a square.

5. **Final Value of `ways`:**
   - The function correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions.
   - The number of valid pairs is indeed \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The code iterates over possible values of `a` and `b`, checks the conditions for forming a rectangle but not a square, and counts the valid pairs.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate.
