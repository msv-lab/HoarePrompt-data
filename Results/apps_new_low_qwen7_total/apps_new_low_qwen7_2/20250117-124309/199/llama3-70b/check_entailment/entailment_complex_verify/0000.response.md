### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and its logic based on the given problem statement and the annotated code.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split a stick of length `n` into four parts of positive integer lengths.
   - These parts should be able to form a rectangle but not a square.
   - A rectangle can be formed if the four parts can be paired into two pairs with equal sums.
   - A square cannot be formed if no part is equal to any other part.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` such that `a + b == n / 2` and `a != b`.
   - The loop ensures that the sum of the four parts equals `n` and that `a` and `b` are not equal, thus forming a rectangle but not a square.

3. **Annotated Code Breakdown:**
   - The loop iterates over `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.
   - For each `a`, `b` is determined as `b = (n - a) / 2`.
   - The condition `a != b` ensures that the parts are not equal, which prevents forming a square.
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the parts sum up to `n`.

4. **Validation with Examples:**
   - For `n = 6`:
     - Possible pairs `(a, b)` are `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)`.
     - The only valid way is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`.
     - The program outputs `1`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 20`:
     - Possible pairs `(a, b)` include `(1, 9)`, `(2, 8)`, `(3, 7)`, and `(4, 6)`.
     - The valid ways are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`.
     - However, the program should exclude `{5, 5, 5, 5}` as it forms a square.
     - The program outputs `4`, which is incorrect according to the original assessment.

5. **Revised Program Logic:**
   - To ensure no configuration forms a square, the program should explicitly check if all parts are equal.
   - If all parts are equal, the program should skip counting this configuration.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the case where all parts are equal, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the condition that no configuration should be able to form a square.
