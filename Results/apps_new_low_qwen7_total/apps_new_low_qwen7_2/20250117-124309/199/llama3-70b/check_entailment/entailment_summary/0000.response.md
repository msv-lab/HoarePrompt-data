Reasoning:
The given program aims to count the number of ways to split a stick of length \( n \) into four parts such that those parts can form a rectangle but not a square. However, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it counts the number of pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a \neq b\), which is not relevant to the problem statement. 

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find pairs of lengths \((x, y)\) such that the stick can be divided into four parts of lengths \((x, x, y, y)\), ensuring they form a rectangle (which is true if \(x \neq y\)) but not a square (which means \(x \neq y\)). This translates to finding pairs \((x, y)\) such that \(2x + 2y = n\) and \(x \neq y\).

However, the current implementation uses a nested loop that checks \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\), which does not align with the requirement of forming a rectangle with two different side lengths. The execution summary mentions that the program returns \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\), which is also incorrect because it does not account for the condition \(x \neq y\).

Given these issues, the provided program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
