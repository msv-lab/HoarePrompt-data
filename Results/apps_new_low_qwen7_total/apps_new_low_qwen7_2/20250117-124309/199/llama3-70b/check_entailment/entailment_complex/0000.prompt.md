Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.

# Annotated Program:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given Python loop and its behavior step by step.
    #
    #### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
    #The loop iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` within specified ranges, checking if the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) holds and \(a \neq b\). The variable `ways` is incremented each time this condition is met.
    #
    #### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
    #- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains constant throughout the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.
    #- **`ways`**: This variable starts at 0 and is incremented each time the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\) is satisfied.
    #- **`a` and `b`**: These variables take on values within their respective ranges during each iteration but are not stored outside the loop for future use.
    #
    #### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
    #The loop checks every possible pair \((a, b)\) where \(a\) ranges from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2}\) and \(b\) ranges from \(a\) to \(\frac{n - a}{2}\). It increments `ways` if \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
    #
    #### Step 4: Verify Relationships
    #- The loop will execute if \(n\) is even, because for odd \(n\), there can't be a pair \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).
    #- For even \(n\), the loop will iterate through all valid pairs \((a, b)\) until it finds all pairs that satisfy the condition.
    #
    #### Final Output State Calculation
    #To find the final value of `ways`, we need to determine all pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
    #
    #Since \(2 \times (a + b) == n\), it simplifies to \(a + b == \frac{n}{2}\). We need to count all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a < b \leq \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a + b == \frac{n}{2}\).
    #
    #For each valid \(a\), there is exactly one corresponding \(b\) such that \(b = \frac{n}{2} - a\) and \(a \neq b\). Therefore, the number of valid pairs is half the number of integers from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2}\), minus one (to exclude the case where \(a = b\)).
    #
    #Thus, the number of valid pairs is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\frac{n}{2}}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #Output State: `ways` is equal to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).
    return ways
    #`ways` is equal to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which must be a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^9\). The function calculates the number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a \neq b\). The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the value \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).
