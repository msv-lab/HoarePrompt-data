Reasoning:

The annotated program logic is correct in determining the number of ways to split the stick into four parts to form a rectangle but not a square. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input and Loop Initialization**: 
   - The function initializes the count of ways (`ways`) to 0 and then iterates over possible values of `a` and `b`.
   
2. **Loop Constraints**:
   - `a` ranges from 1 to `n // 2` to ensure that both `a` and `b` are positive integers and that the sum of `a` and `b` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - `b` ranges from `a` to `(n - a) // 2` to avoid redundant checks and to ensure `b` is also a positive integer and the sum `a + b` does not exceed `n / 2`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the total length of the stick is evenly divided into four parts to form a rectangle.
   - The condition `a != b` ensures that no two sides of the rectangle are equal, thus avoiding the formation of a square.

4. **Calculation of Ways**:
   - The number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b == n / 2` and `a != b` is correctly calculated. Since each valid `a` corresponds to exactly one valid `b`, the total number of such pairs is effectively \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).

5. **Final Return Value**:
   - The function returns the count of valid pairs, which is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).

Given the above analysis, the function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Thus, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
