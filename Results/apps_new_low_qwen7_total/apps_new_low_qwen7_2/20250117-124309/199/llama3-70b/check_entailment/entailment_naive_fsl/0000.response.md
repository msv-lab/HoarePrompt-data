Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that the four parts should not be able to form a square. Specifically, the program checks if `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, which ensures that the parts can form a rectangle but does not guarantee that they cannot form a square. For instance, consider the input `20`. The program would output `4`, but one of the valid ways to split the stick is `{5, 5, 5, 5}`, which forms a square. This violates the requirement that no configuration should be able to form a square.

A correct approach would ensure that the four parts cannot all be equal. The program should exclude cases where all four parts are the same value.
