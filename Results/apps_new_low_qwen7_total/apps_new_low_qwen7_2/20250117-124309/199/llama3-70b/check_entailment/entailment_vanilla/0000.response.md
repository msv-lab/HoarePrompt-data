Reasoning:
- The problem requires counting the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that the parts can form a rectangle but not a square.
- A rectangle can be formed if two pairs of opposite sides are equal, i.e., if we have lengths `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that `a == c` and `b == d` and `a != b`.
- The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to find valid splits.
- For each valid split, the code checks if the sum of `a` and `b` equals half the total length `n/2` and ensures `a` is not equal to `b` to prevent forming a square.
- The loop constraints ensure that all parts are positive integers and the conditions for forming a rectangle but not a square are met.
- The given code logic correctly identifies the valid splits and increments the `ways` counter accordingly.

Based on the above reasoning, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
