`ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `ways` was initially incremented under certain conditions, but those conditions did not affect its current value. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a` < `n`, `b` is `a + 2`, `(n - a) // 2 + 1` >= 1, `ways` is incremented by 1.**
