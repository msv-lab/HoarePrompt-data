Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):`. The variables in the loop head are `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
   - `a` is an integer
   - `n` is an integer
   - `a` < `n`
   - `b` = `a + 1`
   - `(n - a) // 2 + 1` >= 1
   - If `a` != `b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, then `ways` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the condition does not affect the value of `ways`.

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop condition for the for loop is `b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)`.
   - After the previous iteration, `b` was set to `a + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `b` must be within the range defined by the loop head, i.e., `a <= b < (n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - Since `b` was `a + 1` in the previous iteration, the next possible value for `b` would be `a + 2` (assuming the loop increments `b` by 1).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `a` remains the same as it is not being changed by the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not being changed by the loop.
   - `b` changes from `a + 1` to `a + 2`.
   - The condition `(n - a) // 2 + 1` >= 1 remains unchanged.
   - The value of `ways` does not change based on the condition in the loop body.

Given these adjustments, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a` < `n`, `b` is `a + 2`, `(n - a) // 2 + 1` >= 1, if `a` != `b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, then `ways` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the condition does not affect the value of `ways`.**
