The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. This means that the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions increases by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`ways` is the number of pairs (a, b) such that 2 * (a + b) == n and a != b, and a is in the range [0, n//2], plus 1; `a` is k + 1; `b` is at least k + 1, and the current value of `b` satisfies (a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n).**
