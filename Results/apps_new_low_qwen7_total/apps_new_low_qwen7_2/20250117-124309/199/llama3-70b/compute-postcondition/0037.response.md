Let's analyze the given Python loop and its behavior step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` within specified ranges, checking if the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) holds and \(a \neq b\). The variable `ways` is incremented each time this condition is met.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains constant throughout the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.
- **`ways`**: This variable starts at 0 and is incremented each time the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\) is satisfied.
- **`a` and `b`**: These variables take on values within their respective ranges during each iteration but are not stored outside the loop for future use.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop checks every possible pair \((a, b)\) where \(a\) ranges from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2}\) and \(b\) ranges from \(a\) to \(\frac{n - a}{2}\). It increments `ways` if \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- The loop will execute if \(n\) is even, because for odd \(n\), there can't be a pair \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).
- For even \(n\), the loop will iterate through all valid pairs \((a, b)\) until it finds all pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Final Output State Calculation
To find the final value of `ways`, we need to determine all pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).

Since \(2 \times (a + b) == n\), it simplifies to \(a + b == \frac{n}{2}\). We need to count all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a < b \leq \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a + b == \frac{n}{2}\).

For each valid \(a\), there is exactly one corresponding \(b\) such that \(b = \frac{n}{2} - a\) and \(a \neq b\). Therefore, the number of valid pairs is half the number of integers from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2}\), minus one (to exclude the case where \(a = b\)).

Thus, the number of valid pairs is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\frac{n}{2}}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).

### Final Output State
Output State: `ways` is equal to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).
