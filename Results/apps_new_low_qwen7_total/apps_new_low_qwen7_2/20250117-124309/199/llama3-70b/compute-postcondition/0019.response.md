The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. The initial state specifies that `ways` is the number of pairs (a, b) such that 2 * (a + b) == n and a != b, and a is in the range [0, n//2], plus 1 if the condition (a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n) is satisfied. Since the value of `ways` is being incremented by 1, we simply add 1 to the current value of `ways`.

Other variables (`a` and `b`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ways` is the number of pairs (a, b) such that 2 * (a + b) == n and a != b, and a is in the range [0, n//2], plus 1 if the condition (a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n) is satisfied; plus 1; `a` is k + 1; `b` is k + 2**
