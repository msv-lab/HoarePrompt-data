`ways` is incremented by 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The initial condition that `a` is an integer such that `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1` and `b` is an integer different from `a` are still valid.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is an integer different from `a` and `b` becomes `b + 1`, and `ways` is incremented by 1.**
