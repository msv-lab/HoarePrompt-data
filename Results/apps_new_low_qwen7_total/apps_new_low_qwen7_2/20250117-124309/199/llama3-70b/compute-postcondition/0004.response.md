`ways` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions given in the problem statement are still valid.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a` must be less than `n`, `b` must be equal to `a`, and `(n - a) // 2 + 1` must be at least 1. The current value of `a` is not equal to `b` and the current value of `2 * (a + b)` is equal to `n`; `ways` is increased by 1.**
