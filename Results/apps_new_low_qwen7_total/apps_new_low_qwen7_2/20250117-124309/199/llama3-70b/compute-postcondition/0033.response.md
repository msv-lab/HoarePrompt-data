The only variables in the loop head are `b` and the range conditions related to `b`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `a`, `b`, and the range condition involving `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is an integer such that `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`
- `b` is an integer different from `a`
- `b` becomes `b + 1`
- `ways` is incremented by 1 if the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` is true; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The new value of `b` should be the current value of `b` plus 1.
- We need to check if the updated value of `b` still satisfies the range condition `b < (n - a) // 2 + 1`.

Let's denote the current value of `b` as `b_current`. The new value of `b` will be `b_current + 1`.

We need to ensure that `b_current + 1` is still within the range `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

If `b_current + 1` is still within this range, then the loop can continue. Otherwise, the loop will terminate.

State: **`a` is an integer such that `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is `b_current + 1`, and `b` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`**
