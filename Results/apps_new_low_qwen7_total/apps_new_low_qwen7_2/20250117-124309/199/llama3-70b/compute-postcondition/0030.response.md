Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as: `for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):`
   - The variables involved in this loop are `b`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is an integer such that `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - `b` is an integer different from `a`.
   - `ways` is increased by 1 if `2 * (a + b) == n`, otherwise `ways` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `b`:**
   - The loop starts with `b = a` and increments `b` until `b < (n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `b` is incremented by 1, the new value of `b` will be `b + 1`.
   - The conditions for `a` and `ways` remain the same because they are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `b`.

5. **New State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `a` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
   - `b` becomes `b + 1`.
   - `ways` remains unchanged unless the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` is met in the next iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`a` is an integer such that `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is an integer different from `a` and `b` becomes `b + 1`, and `ways` remains unchanged.**

State: **`a` is an integer such that `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is an integer different from `a` and `b` becomes `b + 1`, and `ways` remains unchanged.**
