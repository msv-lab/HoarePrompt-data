`ways` is incremented by 1. The values of `a` and `b` are not directly affected by this line of code, and their conditions remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is `b_current + 1` and is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, `ways` is incremented by 1**
