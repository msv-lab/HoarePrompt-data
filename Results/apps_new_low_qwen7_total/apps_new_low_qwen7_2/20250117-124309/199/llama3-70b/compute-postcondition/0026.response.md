To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and analyze the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- The only state that changes is the value of `a`. It increases by `1` each iteration.
- The state `ways` remains unchanged until the loop body is executed.

### Loop Condition:
```
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables Involved**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `b`, `a`, and `n`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `b` is within the range defined by `range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)`.

For the loop to execute the first time:
- `b` must be within the specified range.
- Since `b` starts from `a` and increments in the loop, the smallest possible value for `b` is `a`.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `b` must be equal to `a`. This implies that `a` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The state must be such that `a` is a valid starting point for `b` to enter the loop. Therefore, `a` must be a valid initial value that satisfies the condition `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`a` must be a valid initial value such that `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`, ways is unchanged**.

This ensures that the loop can execute at least once, with `b` starting from `a` and satisfying the loop condition.
