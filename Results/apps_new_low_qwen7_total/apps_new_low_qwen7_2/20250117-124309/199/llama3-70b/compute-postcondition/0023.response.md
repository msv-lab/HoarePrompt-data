Postcondition: ***`ways` is the number of pairs (a, b) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\), and \(a\) is in the range [0, \(n//2\)], plus 1 if the condition \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) is satisfied, plus 1. If \(a\) is k + 2 and \(b\) is k + 3, then `ways` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ways` remains unchanged.***
