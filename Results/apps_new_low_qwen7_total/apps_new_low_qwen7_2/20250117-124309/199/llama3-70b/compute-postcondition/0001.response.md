Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
   ```
   The variables involved in the loop head are `a` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `a` is within the range specified by `range(1, n // 2 + 1)`. This means `a` should be between 1 and `n // 2 + 1` (inclusive).

3. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
   - `ways` is initially 0, but this variable is not relevant to the loop's condition.

4. **First Iteration Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute for the first time, `a` must be set to 1 because the loop starts with the smallest value in the range, which is 1.
   - `n` must still satisfy the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\), and since we are considering the first iteration, `n` can be any value within this range.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must be met:
- `a` must be 1.
- `n` must be within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).

**State:**
**`a` is 1, `n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^9**
