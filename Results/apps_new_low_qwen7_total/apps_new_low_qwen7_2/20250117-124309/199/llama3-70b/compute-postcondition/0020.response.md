Postcondition: ***`ways` is the number of pairs (a, b) such that 2 * (a + b) == n and a != b, and a is in the range [0, n//2], plus 1 if the condition (a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n) is satisfied. If the condition `a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` is true, `ways` is incremented by 1; `a` is k + 1; `b` is k + 2. There is no change in `ways` if the condition is false.***
