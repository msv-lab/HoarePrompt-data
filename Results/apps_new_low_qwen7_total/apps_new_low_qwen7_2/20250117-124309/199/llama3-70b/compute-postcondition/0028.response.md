`ways` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions for `a` and `b` are unchanged, meaning `a` is an integer such that `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is an integer different from `a`, and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is an integer different from `a`, and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`; `ways` is increased by 1**
