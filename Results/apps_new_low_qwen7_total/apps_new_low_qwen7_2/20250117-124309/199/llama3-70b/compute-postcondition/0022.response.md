`ways` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ways` was defined by the number of pairs (a, b) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\), and \(a\) is in the range [0, \(n//2\)], plus 1 if the condition \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) is satisfied. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`ways` is the number of pairs (a, b) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\), and \(a\) is in the range [0, \(n//2\)], plus 1 if the condition \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) is satisfied, plus 1; `a` is k + 2; `b` is k + 3.**
