You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given Python loop and its behavior step by step.
    #
    #### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
    #The loop iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` within specified ranges, checking if the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) holds and \(a \neq b\). The variable `ways` is incremented each time this condition is met.
    #
    #### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
    #- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains constant throughout the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.
    #- **`ways`**: This variable starts at 0 and is incremented each time the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\) is satisfied.
    #- **`a` and `b`**: These variables take on values within their respective ranges during each iteration but are not stored outside the loop for future use.
    #
    #### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
    #The loop checks every possible pair \((a, b)\) where \(a\) ranges from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2}\) and \(b\) ranges from \(a\) to \(\frac{n - a}{2}\). It increments `ways` if \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
    #
    #### Step 4: Verify Relationships
    #- The loop will execute if \(n\) is even, because for odd \(n\), there can't be a pair \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).
    #- For even \(n\), the loop will iterate through all valid pairs \((a, b)\) until it finds all pairs that satisfy the condition.
    #
    #### Final Output State Calculation
    #To find the final value of `ways`, we need to determine all pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
    #
    #Since \(2 \times (a + b) == n\), it simplifies to \(a + b == \frac{n}{2}\). We need to count all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a < b \leq \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a + b == \frac{n}{2}\).
    #
    #For each valid \(a\), there is exactly one corresponding \(b\) such that \(b = \frac{n}{2} - a\) and \(a \neq b\). Therefore, the number of valid pairs is half the number of integers from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2}\), minus one (to exclude the case where \(a = b\)).
    #
    #Thus, the number of valid pairs is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\frac{n}{2}}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #Output State: `ways` is equal to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).
    return ways
    #`ways` is equal to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `n`, returns \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).

```

Return Postconditions: `ways` is equal to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\)


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
