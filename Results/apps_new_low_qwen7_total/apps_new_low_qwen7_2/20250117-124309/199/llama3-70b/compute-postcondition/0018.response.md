Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
   ```
   From this, we can see that the loop variable is `b`.

2. **Understand the initial states**:
   - `ways` is the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`, and `a` is in the range `[0, n//2]`.
   - `a` is set to `k + 1`.
   - `b` is at least `k + 1`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is `k + 1` and `b` is at least `k + 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `b` is within the range specified by the loop header: `b` should be in the range `[a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)`.

4. **Calculate the new values**:
   - Since `a` is fixed at `k + 1` and `b` starts at `k + 1` and increases by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `b` will be `k + 2`.
   - We need to check if `k + 2` is within the range `[k + 1, (n - (k + 1)) // 2 + 1)`.

5. **Check the range for the next iteration**:
   - The lower bound of the range is `k + 1` (which remains unchanged).
   - The upper bound is `(n - (k + 1)) // 2 + 1`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The value of `a` remains `k + 1`.
   - The value of `b` will be `k + 2` if it is within the range.

7. **Final state**:
   - `ways` remains unchanged unless the condition `(a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n)` is satisfied in the loop body.
   - `a` is still `k + 1`.
   - `b` is now `k + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ways` is the number of pairs (a, b) such that 2 * (a + b) == n and a != b, and a is in the range [0, n//2], plus 1 if the condition (a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n) is satisfied; `a` is k + 1; `b` is k + 2**.
