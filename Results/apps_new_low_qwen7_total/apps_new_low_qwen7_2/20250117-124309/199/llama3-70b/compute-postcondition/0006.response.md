Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `a` must be less than `n`.
   - `b` must be equal to `a`.
   - `(n - a) // 2 + 1` must be at least 1.
   - `ways` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state but is used in the loop body.

2. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `b` in the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `b`.
   - Since the loop starts with `b = a`, and it increments `b` in each iteration, the state of `b` needs to be adjusted for the next iteration.

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `b` is within the specified range, i.e., `a <= b < (n - a) // 2 + 1`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is equal to `a`.
   - For the loop to continue, `b` should be incremented to the next value in the range.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `b` will be incremented by 1, so `b` will be `a + 1`.
- `a` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.
- `ways` remains unchanged because no information suggests it is modified based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`a` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a` must be less than `n`, `b` must be equal to `a + 1`, and `(n - a) // 2 + 1` must be at least 1.**
