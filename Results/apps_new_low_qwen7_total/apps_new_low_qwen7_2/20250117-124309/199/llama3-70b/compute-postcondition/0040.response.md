Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which must be a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^9\). The function calculates the number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a \neq b\). The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the value \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).**

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If \(n\) is odd, no valid pairs \((a, b)\) exist since \(a + b\) cannot equal \(\frac{n}{2}\) when \(n\) is odd. In this case, the function correctly returns 0.
  - If \(n\) is even, the function iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and counts those that satisfy \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a \neq b\). The final result is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\).

- **Missing Functionality:**
  - The code does not explicitly check for non-integer inputs. While the problem statement specifies that \(n\) is a positive integer, the function should ideally handle or raise an error for non-integer inputs. However, the current implementation assumes \(n\) is always an integer due to the constraints provided.

In summary, the function correctly calculates the number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) under the given conditions and returns the appropriate result, handling both odd and even values of \(n\) appropriately.
