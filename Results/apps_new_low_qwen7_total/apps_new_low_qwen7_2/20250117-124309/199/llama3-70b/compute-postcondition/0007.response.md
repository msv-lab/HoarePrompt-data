`ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `a` remains an integer, `n` remains an integer, and `a` must still be less than `n`. Additionally, `b` must still be equal to `a + 1`, and `(n - a) // 2 + 1` must still be at least 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a` < `n`, `b` = `a + 1`, `(n - a) // 2 + 1` >= 1, `ways` is incremented by 1**
