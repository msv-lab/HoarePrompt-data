Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the depot has no walls. According to the problem description, the input can have cells that are either empty (".") or occupied by a wall ("*"). However, the program does not check if the depot has any walls at all before attempting to find a placement for the bomb.

In the following example, the depot has no walls, so the program should output "NO", but it incorrectly outputs "YES" because it checks for the possibility of wiping out walls without verifying the presence of any walls:

```
Input:
3 3
...
...
...

Output:
YES
1 1
```

This output is incorrect because there are no walls to be wiped out, and placing the bomb anywhere would not change this. Therefore, the program fails to handle this specific case correctly.
