Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
2. It initializes the necessary lists to keep track of the number of walls in each row (`row_walls`) and column (`col_walls`), and a variable `total_walls` to count the total number of walls.
3. The nested loops iterate through each cell in the grid to update the counts in `row_walls` and `col_walls`, and to calculate `total_walls`.
4. After populating these variables, the function enters another set of nested loops to check if there exists a cell `(i, j)` such that the sum of the walls in row `i` and column `j` (adjusted for the cell itself if it is a wall) equals `total_walls`.
5. If such a cell is found, the function prints "YES" followed by the coordinates `(i + 1, j + 1)` and exits. If no such cell is found, the function prints "NO".
6. The function logic correctly identifies whether it is possible to wipe out all walls with one bomb by checking the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls`.

Given the logical correctness and proper handling of the grid, the function should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
