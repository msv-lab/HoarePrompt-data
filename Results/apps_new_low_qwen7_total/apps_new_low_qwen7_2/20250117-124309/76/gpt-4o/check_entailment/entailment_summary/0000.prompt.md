Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given a description of a depot. It is a rectangular checkered field of n × m size. Each cell in a field can be empty (".") or it can be occupied by a wall ("*"). 

You have one bomb. If you lay the bomb at the cell (x, y), then after triggering it will wipe out all walls in the row x and all walls in the column y.

You are to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls in the depot by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The bomb can be laid both in an empty cell or in a cell occupied by a wall.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the depot field. 

The next n lines contain m symbols "." and "*" each — the description of the field. j-th symbol in i-th of them stands for cell (i, j). If the symbol is equal to ".", then the corresponding cell is empty, otherwise it equals "*" and the corresponding cell is occupied by a wall.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb, then print "NO" in the first line (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line and two integers in the second line — the coordinates of the cell at which the bomb should be laid. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

        index += 1
    row_walls = [0] * n
    col_walls = [0] * m
    total_walls = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == '*':
                row_walls[i] += 1
                col_walls[j] += 1

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
    print('NO')





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` processes a depot field grid consisting of `n` rows and `m` columns. Each cell in the grid is either an empty cell (`"."`) or a cell occupied by a wall (`"*"`). The function calculates the number of walls in each row and column and then checks if there is a cell `(i, j)` such that the sum of the walls in row `i` and column `j` minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls in the grid. If such a cell is found, the function prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the cell `(i+1, j+1)` and returns `None`. If no such cell is found, the function prints 'NO' and returns `None`.

The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on input read from standard input. It reads the dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`), followed by the grid itself, and processes the grid according to the specified conditions. If the grid is such that the sum of walls in any row and column (considering the cell itself if it is a wall) matches the total number of walls, the function indicates this by printing 'YES' and the coordinates. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the grid is empty (`n = 0` or `m = 0`), the function still processes the grid and prints 'NO'.
- If all cells are empty (`"."`), the function prints 'NO'.
- If the grid has no walls (`"*"`), the function also prints 'NO'.
- The function handles the case where the sum condition is met exactly, indicating the presence of a valid cell.
