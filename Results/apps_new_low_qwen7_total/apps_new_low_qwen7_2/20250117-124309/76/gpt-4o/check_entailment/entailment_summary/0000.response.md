Reasoning:

The given program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if it's possible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. Let's break down the key aspects:

1. **Input Reading and Grid Construction**: 
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It constructs the grid by reading `n` lines of input and storing them in a list of strings.
   
2. **Wall Count Calculation**:
   - It correctly counts the number of walls in each row and each column.
   - It calculates the total number of walls in the grid.
   
3. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if there exists a cell `(i, j)` such that the sum of the walls in row `i` and column `j` minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls.
   - This is the correct approach to determine if the walls can be wiped out with one bomb.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the grid is empty or has no walls, printing 'NO' in such scenarios.
   - It also correctly handles edge cases like `n = 0` or `m = 0`, which would result in an empty grid and thus 'NO'.

Given these points, the program logic seems to align with the problem description and the provided execution summary. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
