### Reasoning:

The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly handle the case where the depot has no walls, leading to an incorrect output. However, upon closer inspection, the provided program does indeed check for the presence of walls and handles the case where the depot has no walls appropriately.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the dimensions `n` and `m`, followed by the grid itself.
2. **Initializing Variables**: It initializes arrays `row_walls` and `col_walls` to count the number of walls in each row and column, respectively. It also initializes `total_walls` to count the total number of walls in the grid.
3. **Counting Walls**: It iterates through the grid to populate `row_walls` and `col_walls` and to calculate `total_walls`.
4. **Checking for Valid Cell**: It then iterates through the grid again to check if there is a cell `(i, j)` such that the sum of the walls in row `i` and column `j` minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls. If such a cell is found, it prints 'YES' and the coordinates.
5. **No Valid Cell Found**: If no such cell is found, it prints 'NO'.

To verify this, let's consider the following scenarios:

- **Example with No Walls**: If the grid has no walls, `total_walls` will be 0. In this case, the program will not find any cell that satisfies the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls`, since `total_walls` is 0. Therefore, the program will correctly print 'NO'.
  
  For instance, the grid:
  ```
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ```

  The program will process the grid and correctly print:
  ```
  NO
  ```

- **Example with Walls**: If the grid has walls, the program will correctly identify a valid cell to place the bomb if the condition is met. For instance, the grid:
  ```
  .*
  ..
  .
  ```

  The program will process the grid and correctly print:
  ```
  YES
  1 1
  ```

Given the provided examples and the function summary, the program correctly handles all edge cases, including the absence of walls. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
