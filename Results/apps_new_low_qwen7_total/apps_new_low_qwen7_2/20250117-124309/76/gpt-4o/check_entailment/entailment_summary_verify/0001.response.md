### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Parsing Grid:**
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and parses the dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - It then constructs the grid by appending each row to the `grid` list. This part is correct.

2. **Counting Walls:**
   - The program counts the total number of walls (`total_walls`) and the number of walls in each row (`row_walls`) and each column (`col_walls`). This is done correctly.

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, the program checks if the sum of the walls in its row and column minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls.
   - If such a condition is met, it means that placing a bomb in this cell would indeed wipe out all the walls, making the answer "YES".
   - If no such cell is found, the program prints "NO".

4. **Output:**
   - If a valid position is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of the cell where the bomb should be placed.
   - If no valid position is found, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of Function Summary:

The function summary provided is consistent with the actual implementation of `func_1`. It accurately describes how the function processes the grid, counts walls, and checks for the feasibility of wiping out all walls with one bomb.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- **Empty Grid:** The program correctly handles the case where the grid is empty by printing "NO".
- **All Empty Cells:** The program correctly handles the case where all cells are empty by printing "NO".
- **No Walls:** The program correctly handles the case where the grid has no walls by printing "NO".
- **Sum Condition Match:** The program correctly identifies if the sum condition is met exactly, indicating the presence of a valid cell.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, the function summary, and the potential edge cases, we can confirm that the logic in the program matches the problem statement perfectly. The program correctly identifies if it's possible to wipe out all walls with one bomb placement and provides a valid coordinate if possible.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
