### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Parsing Grid:**
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and parses the dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - It then constructs the grid by appending each row to the `grid` list. This part is correct.

2. **Counting Walls:**
   - The program counts the total number of walls (`total_walls`) and the number of walls in each row (`row_walls`) and each column (`col_walls`). This is done correctly.

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, the program checks if the sum of the walls in its row and column minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls.
   - This condition is correctly formulated and implemented:
     ```python
     if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
         print('YES')
         print(i + 1, j + 1)
         return
     ```
   - However, there is a logical flaw in the condition:
     - If `grid[i][j]` is a wall (`'*'`), the condition subtracts 1 from the total walls. But the total number of walls is already counted without double-counting the wall at `(i, j)`.
     - The correct condition should be:
       ```python
       if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
       ```

4. **Output:**
   - If a valid position is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of the cell where the bomb should be placed.
   - If no valid position is found, it prints "NO".

### Evaluation:
- The logic in the program almost matches the problem statement perfectly, but there is a subtle error in the feasibility check.
- Specifically, the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` incorrectly subtracts 1 when the cell is a wall, leading to incorrect results.

### Corrected Condition:
The correct condition should be:
```python
if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] == total_walls:
```
This ensures that the total number of walls in the row and column (including the cell itself if it is a wall) matches the total number of walls in the grid.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect due to the logical flaw in the feasibility check condition.

### Final:
**False**

The corrected program should look like this:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    grid = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        grid.append(data[index])
        index += 1
    row_walls = [0] * n
    col_walls = [0] * m
    total_walls = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == '*':
                row_walls[i] += 1
                col_walls[j] += 1
                total_walls += 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
    print('NO')
```
