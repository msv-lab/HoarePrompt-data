### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its annotated version against the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Input Reading and Grid Construction:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It constructs the grid from the input strings.
   - It initializes `row_walls` and `col_walls` arrays to keep track of the number of walls in each row and column.
   - It correctly counts the total number of walls in the grid and updates the `row_walls` and `col_walls` arrays.

2. **Condition Check for Bomb Placement:**
   - The program checks if there exists a cell `(i, j)` such that the sum of the walls in row `i` and column `j` minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls in the grid.
   - If such a cell is found, it prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of the cell.
   - If no such cell is found, it prints "NO".

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as an empty grid (`n = 0` or `m = 0`) and grids with only empty cells (no walls).
   - In these cases, the program correctly prints "NO" because there are no walls to be wiped out.

4. **Verification Using Examples:**
   - For the first example:
     ```
     Input:
     3 4
     .*..
     ....
     .*..
     
     Output:
     YES
     1 2
     ```
     This output is correct. The program finds a valid cell `(1, 2)` where placing the bomb would wipe out all walls.

   - For the second example:
     ```
     Input:
     3 3
     ..*
     .*
     *..
     
     Output:
     NO
     ```
     This output is also correct. There are no walls in the grid, so the program correctly prints "NO".

   - For the third example:
     ```
     Input:
     6 5
     ..*..
     ..*..
     *****
     ..*..
     ..*..
     ..*..
     
     Output:
     YES
     3 3
     ```
     This output is correct. The program finds a valid cell `(3, 3)` where placing the bomb would wipe out all walls.

Given the analysis and the examples, the program correctly handles all cases, including edge cases where the grid has no walls.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and handles all edge cases properly. The original assessment was inaccurate because it incorrectly identified a failure to handle the case where the depot has no walls. The program actually correctly identifies such cases and outputs "NO" as expected.
