You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a description of a depot. It is a rectangular checkered field of n × m size. Each cell in a field can be empty (".") or it can be occupied by a wall ("*"). 

You have one bomb. If you lay the bomb at the cell (x, y), then after triggering it will wipe out all walls in the row x and all walls in the column y.

You are to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls in the depot by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The bomb can be laid both in an empty cell or in a cell occupied by a wall.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the depot field. 

The next n lines contain m symbols "." and "*" each — the description of the field. j-th symbol in i-th of them stands for cell (i, j). If the symbol is equal to ".", then the corresponding cell is empty, otherwise it equals "*" and the corresponding cell is occupied by a wall.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb, then print "NO" in the first line (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line and two integers in the second line — the coordinates of the cell at which the bomb should be laid. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `row_walls[i]` is equal to the number of columns `j` where `grid[i][j]` is '*', `col_walls[j]` is equal to the number of rows `i` where `grid[i][j]` is '*', and `total_walls` is the sum of all `row_walls[i]` values (or equivalently, the sum of all `col_walls[j]` values).
    #
    #Explanation:
    #- The loop iterates over every element in the grid. The variable `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases until it reaches 0. The inner loop iterates over each column `j`.
    #- If `grid[i][j]` is '*', then `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` are incremented, and `total_walls` is also incremented.
    #- The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the grid that are '*'. Once all elements in the grid are checked, the loop stops.
    #
    #By the time the loop completes, `i` will be 0 because the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to 0. The value of `m` remains unchanged since it is an invariant throughout the loop. The `row_walls` and `col_walls` arrays are updated based on the occurrences of '*' in the grid, and `total_walls` reflects the total count of '*' in the grid.
    #
    #Thus, the final state of the program after the loop has executed is as described above.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0
                ) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `0`, `m` is greater than 0, `row_walls[i]` is the total count of '*' in the last row `n-1`, `col_walls[j]` is the total count of '*' in columns `j` where `0 <= j < m`, and `total_walls` is the sum of all `row_walls[i]` values (or equivalently, the sum of all `col_walls[j]` values).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the depot has no walls. According to the problem description, the input can have cells that are either empty (".") or occupied by a wall ("*"). However, the program does not check if the depot has any walls at all before attempting to find a placement for the bomb.

In the following example, the depot has no walls, so the program should output "NO", but it incorrectly outputs "YES" because it checks for the possibility of wiping out walls without verifying the presence of any walls:

```
Input:
3 3
...
...
...

Output:
YES
1 1
```

This output is incorrect because there are no walls to be wiped out, and placing the bomb anywhere would not change this. Therefore, the program fails to handle this specific case correctly.
