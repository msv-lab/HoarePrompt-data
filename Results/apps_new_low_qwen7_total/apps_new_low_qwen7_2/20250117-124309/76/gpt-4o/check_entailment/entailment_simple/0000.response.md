Reasoning:

The annotated program logic appears to be correctly following the problem statement and requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the input dimensions and the grid correctly using `sys.stdin.read`.
2. **Initializing Arrays**: It initializes `row_walls` and `col_walls` to count the number of walls in each row and column respectively.
3. **Counting Walls**: The nested loops correctly iterate through the grid to populate these arrays and count the total number of walls.
4. **Checking Conditions**: The subsequent nested loops check if there exists a cell (i, j) such that if a bomb is placed there, all walls can be wiped out. This is done by verifying if the sum of walls in the row `i` and column `j` minus the wall at cell `(i, j)` (if present) equals the total number of walls.
5. **Output**: If such a cell is found, it prints "YES" followed by the coordinates. If no such cell is found, it prints "NO".

Given this analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and should produce the correct output under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
