### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Parsing Grid:**
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and parses the dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - It then constructs the grid by appending each row to the `grid` list. This part is correct.

2. **Counting Walls:**
   - The program counts the total number of walls (`total_walls`) and the number of walls in each row (`row_walls`) and each column (`col_walls`). This is done correctly.

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, the program checks if the sum of the walls in its row and column minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls. 
   - If such a condition is met, it means that placing a bomb in this cell would indeed wipe out all the walls, making the answer "YES".
   - If no such cell is found, the program prints "NO".

4. **Output:**
   - If a valid position is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of the cell where the bomb should be placed.
   - If no valid position is found, it prints "NO".

### Evaluation:
- The logic in the program matches the problem statement perfectly.
- The program correctly identifies if it's possible to wipe out all walls with one bomb placement and provides a valid coordinate if possible.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct.
