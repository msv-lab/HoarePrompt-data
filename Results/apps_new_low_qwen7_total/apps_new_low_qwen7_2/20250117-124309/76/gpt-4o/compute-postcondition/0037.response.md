Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `grid` is a 2D list. If `grid[i][j]` is '*', then `row_walls[2]` is `initial_row_walls_2 + 1`, `col_walls[0]` is `initial_col_walls_0 + 1`, and `total_walls` is `initial_total_walls + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `row_walls[2]`, `col_walls[0]`, and `total_walls` remain unchanged.***
