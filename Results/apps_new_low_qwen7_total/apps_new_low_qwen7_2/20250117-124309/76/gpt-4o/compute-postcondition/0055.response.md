Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `1` to `m-1`, `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` are integers, `grid[i][j]` is either `'*'` or not `'*'`. If the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` holds true, the program does not return any value. If the condition does not hold, the program also does not return any value.***
