The given code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
print(i + 1, j + 1)
```

Let's analyze the impact of these lines on the program:

1. **First Line: `print('YES')`**
   - This line prints the string `'YES'` to the console.
   - It does not modify any variables.

2. **Second Line: `print(i + 1, j + 1)`**
   - This line prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the console.
   - It does not modify any variables.

Since no variables are modified by these lines, the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `row_walls`, `col_walls`, and `grid` remain the same as they were before the code block was executed. 

Given the initial states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-1`
- `m` must be at least 1
- `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) is not equal to total_walls`

After running the code block, the values of `i` and `j` remain the same, but the output will include the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

Output State: **i is n-1, j is m-1, m is at least 1, row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) is not equal to total_walls, the output is 'YES', i + 1, j + 1**
