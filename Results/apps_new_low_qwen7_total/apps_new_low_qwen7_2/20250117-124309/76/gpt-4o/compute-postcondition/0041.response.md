The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `row_walls[2]` is 1, `col_walls[1]` is 1, `total_walls` is 1, and `grid` is a 2D list. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`.

Since `j` starts from 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration, at the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been 2 (assuming it started from 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `m` is at least 1, `j` needs to be increased to 3.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 2, `row_walls[2]` is 1, `col_walls[1]` is 1, `total_walls` is 1, grid is a 2D list, and if `grid[i][j]` equals '*', the condition remains as is.**
