The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. The function processes a depot field represented by a grid of n rows and m columns, where each cell is either an empty cell indicated by "." or a cell occupied by a wall indicated by "*". Based on the conditions specified, the function can have different behaviors:

- Case_1: The function does not return anything.
- Case_2: The function does not return anything.
- Case_3: The function does not return anything.
- Case_4: The function returns `None`.
- Case_5: The function does not return anything.
- Case_6: The function does not return anything.
- Case_7: The function does not return anything.
- Case_8: The function does not return anything.
- Case_9: The function prints 'YES' and 1, 1 and returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process a depot field grid and based on certain conditions, either return `None`, print and return, or not return anything at all.
