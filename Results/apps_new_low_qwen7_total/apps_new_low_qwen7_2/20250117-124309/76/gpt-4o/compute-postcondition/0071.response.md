Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case involves `j`. Therefore, the state adjustments should focus on `j`.

2. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `j` is `m`
   - The condition involving `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, `grid[i][j]`, and `total_walls` determines whether the loop continues or not.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue if `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls`.
   - Otherwise, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the value of `j`, the variable `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `j` will be updated to `m+1`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `i` remains `n-2` as it is not being changed within the loop head.
   - The condition involving `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, `grid[i][j]`, and `total_walls` does not change the state of `i` and `j` but rather determines whether the loop continues.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m+1`**
