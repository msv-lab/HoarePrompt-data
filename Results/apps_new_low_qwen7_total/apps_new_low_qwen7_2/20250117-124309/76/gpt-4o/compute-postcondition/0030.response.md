Output State: **i is 1, j is 2, row_walls is a dictionary with at least key 1 and its value incremented by 1, col_walls is a dictionary with at least key 2 and its value incremented by 1, total_walls is incremented by 1, n is greater than 1, m is greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The first line `row_walls[i] += 1` increments the value associated with key `i` (which is 1) in the `row_walls` dictionary by 1. Since `i` is initially 1, this means the value of `row_walls[1]` is incremented by 1.
- The second line `col_walls[j] += 1` increments the value associated with key `j` (which is 2) in the `col_walls` dictionary by 1. Since `j` is initially 2, this means the value of `col_walls[2]` is incremented by 1.
- The third line `total_walls += 1` increments the `total_walls` variable by 1. Since `total_walls` was initially unspecified but implied to be greater than 0, it is incremented by 1.
- The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not reassigned or used in any calculation that would change their values.
- The preconditions that `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is greater than 0 remain valid and are not affected by the code.
