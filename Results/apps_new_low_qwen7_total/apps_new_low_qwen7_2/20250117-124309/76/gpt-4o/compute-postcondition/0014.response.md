Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` using `for j in range(m)`.
   - Therefore, the variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `row_walls[0]` is 1, `col_walls[j]` is 1 (where `j` is an index within the bounds of the grid), and `total_walls` is 1.

3. **Update the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is fixed at 0 and does not change within the loop, it remains as `i` is 0.
   - `m` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since no such modification is mentioned, `m` remains greater than 0.
   - `row_walls[0]` is fixed at 1 and does not change within the loop.
   - `col_walls[j]` changes from `col_walls[j-1]` to `col_walls[j]` where `j` increases by 1 in each iteration.
   - `total_walls` is fixed at 1 and does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` becomes `j + 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be 1 for the next iteration (since it was 0 before).

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `row_walls[0]` is 1, `col_walls[1]` is 1, and `total_walls` is 1.**
