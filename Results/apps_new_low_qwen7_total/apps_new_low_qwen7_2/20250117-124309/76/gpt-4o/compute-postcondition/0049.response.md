The given code consists of two print statements:

1. The first print statement prints the string 'YES'.
2. The second print statement prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

Let's analyze the impact of these lines on the variables:

- The first print statement does not modify any variables; it only outputs the string 'YES'.
- The second print statement does not modify any variables either; it only outputs the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

Since no variables are modified by the code, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. The only information provided by the code is the output of the print statements.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is in the range `[0, m-1]`
- There is at least one column `j` such that `grid[n-1][j]` is '*'
- The expression `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0)` equals `total_walls`

After executing the code, the output will be:
- 'YES'
- `i + 1`
- `j + 1`

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **'YES' printed, i is n-1, j is in the range [0, m-1], i + 1 is n, j + 1 is in the range [1, m]**
