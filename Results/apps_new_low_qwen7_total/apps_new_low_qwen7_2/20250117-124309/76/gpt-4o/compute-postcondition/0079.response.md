The code block consists of two print statements. Let's analyze their effects:

1. The first line `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console. This operation does not modify any variables or affect the initial state of the program.
2. The second line `print(i + 1, j + 1)` prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the console. This operation also does not modify any variables or affect the initial state of the program.

Since no new variables are defined and no existing variables are updated, the only changes are the printed outputs. However, these print statements do not alter the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `n`, `row_walls`, `col_walls`, `grid`, or `total_walls`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-1`
- `m` is at least 1
- `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0)` equals `total_walls`

These conditions remain unchanged by the code block.

Output State: **i is n-1, j is m-1, m is at least 1, row_walls is unchanged, col_walls is unchanged, grid is unchanged, total_walls is unchanged**
