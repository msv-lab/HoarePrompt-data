Let's analyze the given loop and track the changes in the variables step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is `n-1`
- There must be at least one column `j` such that `grid[n-1][j]` is '*'

### Code of the Loop
```python
for j in range(m):
    if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
        print('YES')
        print(i + 1, j + 1)
        return
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over all columns `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
2. **Condition Check**: For each `j`, it checks the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls`.
3. **Output**: If the condition is satisfied, it prints `YES` along with the coordinates and returns immediately. If no such `j` satisfies the condition, the loop completes its iterations without printing anything.

### Output States
- **Output State after the loop executes 1 time**: 
  - `i` remains `n-1`
  - `j` is the index where the condition is satisfied (if it exists)
  - `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` are integers
  - `grid[i][j]` is either `'*'` or not `'*'`
  - If the condition is not satisfied for `j = 0`, the loop proceeds to `j = 1`, and so on.
- **Output State after the loop executes 2 times**:
  - `i` remains `n-1`
  - `j` is the index where the condition is satisfied for the second iteration (if it exists)
  - `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` are integers
  - `grid[i][j]` is either `'*'` or not `'*'`
  - If the condition is not satisfied for `j = 0` and `j = 1`, the loop proceeds to `j = 2`, and so on.
- **Output State after the loop executes 3 times**:
  - `i` remains `n-1`
  - `j` is the index where the condition is satisfied for the third iteration (if it exists)
  - `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` are integers
  - `grid[i][j]` is either `'*'` or not `'*'`
  - If the condition is not satisfied for `j = 0`, `j = 1`, and `j = 2`, the loop proceeds to `j = 3`, and so on.

### Final Output State
- **Final Values**:
  - `i` will remain `n-1` because the loop only modifies `j`.
  - `j` will be the last index where the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` is satisfied, or `m-1` if no such `j` is found.
  - `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` will be the values at the end of the loop.
  - `grid[i][j]` will be either `'*'` or not `'*'`.

### Conclusion
The loop will terminate as soon as it finds an index `j` that satisfies the condition. If no such `j` is found, it will complete all iterations and `j` will be `m-1`.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` are integers, `grid[i][j]` is either `'*'` or not `'*'`, and the loop will not print `YES` unless the condition is satisfied at some point.**
