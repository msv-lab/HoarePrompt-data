Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop is iterating over `j` using `range(m)`.
   - Before the loop starts, `j` is initialized to `m-1`.
   - `i` is initialized to `n-2`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop iterates from `j = m-1` down to `j = 0`.
   - The loop will not print `YES` unless the condition inside the loop is satisfied at some point, but this condition is not specified in the given information.

3. **Determine the necessary states for the loop head:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be within the range defined by `range(m)`.
   - Since `j` is initialized to `m-1`, the first iteration will occur when `j` is `m-1`.

4. **Formulate the required state:**
   - `i` is initialized to `n-2`.
   - `j` is initialized to `m-1`.

Given the above analysis, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-1`**
