The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2`, and the loop does not execute. This means that when `i` was `n-2`, it was not less than `n`, so the loop condition `i < n` was false.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should now be `n-1`. However, since the loop does not execute even after incrementing `i` by 1, it implies that `i` must still be equal to or greater than `n`.

Given that the loop does not execute even after `i` is incremented, it means `i` must be exactly `n-1` (if it were `n` or greater, the loop would not execute). Therefore, `i` must remain `n-1` and `n` must be such that `i` is no longer less than `n`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`**
