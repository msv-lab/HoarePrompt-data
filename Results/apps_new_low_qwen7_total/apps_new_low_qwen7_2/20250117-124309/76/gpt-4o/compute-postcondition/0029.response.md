Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(m)`. This means the variables `j` and `m` are the ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - At the start of the loop, `i` is 1.
   - At the start of the loop, `j` is 1.
   - At the start of the loop, `n` is greater than 1.
   - At the start of the loop, `m` is greater than 0.
   - `row_walls[1]`, `col_walls[1]`, and `total_walls` have their initial values (which are unspecified but don't change based on the given conditions).

3. **Update `j` for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop iterates over `range(m)`, the first iteration sets `j` to 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.

4. **Determine the Value of `m`**:
   - The value of `m` does not change within the loop; it remains as it was initially, greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the Other Variables**:
   - `i` and `n` do not change within the loop, so they remain as they were at the start of the loop: `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.
   - `row_walls[1]`, `col_walls[1]`, and `total_walls` do not change within the loop, so they remain as their initial values.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0.**
