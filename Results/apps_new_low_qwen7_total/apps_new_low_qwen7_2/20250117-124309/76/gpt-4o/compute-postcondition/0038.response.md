Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `j` and the condition `range(m)`.
2. **Identify the states in the loop head**: The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `j`.
3. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: At the start of the loop, `j` is set to 0 because `range(m)` starts from 0.
4. **Update the state after each iteration**: After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
5. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, and `grid` is a 2D list, we need to determine the new state of `j` for the next iteration.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, if `j` was 0 at the start, it would now be 1. The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to 1.

### Updated State:
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `m` remains at least 1.
- `grid` remains a 2D list.
- `j` is now 1.

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `grid` is a 2D list, `j` is 1**
