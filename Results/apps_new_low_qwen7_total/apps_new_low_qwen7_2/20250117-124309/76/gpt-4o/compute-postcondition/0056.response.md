Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `j` is `1` to `m-1`
   - `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` are integers
   - `grid[i][j]` is either `'*'` or not `'*'`
   - The condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` holds true for the current values of `i` and `j`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `m-1`:
   ```
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States**: For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `j` must be incremented by 1.

4. **New State**:
   - `i` remains `n-1` because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, which was in the range `[1, m-1]`. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `2` (if `j` was `1` before, and so on).
   - `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` remain the same as they are not affected by the loop.
   - `grid[i][j]` is either `'*'` or not `'*'` and remains the same.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `2` to `m-1`, `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` are integers, `grid[i][j]` is either `'*'` or not `'*'`**.
