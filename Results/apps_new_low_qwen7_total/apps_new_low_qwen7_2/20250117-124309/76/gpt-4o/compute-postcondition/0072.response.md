Output State: **i is n-1, j is m+2, printed lines are 'YES', n-1 m+2** 

Explanation:
1. The first line `print('YES')` prints 'YES' to the console.
2. The second line `print(i + 1, j + 1)` prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n-2` and `j` is `m+1`, after executing these print statements, `i` is updated to `n-1` and `j` is updated to `m+2`.

The initial state of `i` being `n-2` and `j` being `m+1` is modified to `i` being `n-1` and `j` being `m+2` as a result of the code execution. The printed lines are also part of the output but are not included in the final state as per the instruction.
