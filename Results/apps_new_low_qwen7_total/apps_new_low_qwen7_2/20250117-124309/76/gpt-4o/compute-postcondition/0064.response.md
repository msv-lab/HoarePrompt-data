Output State: **i is n-2, j is m-1, total_walls is row_walls[n-3] + col_walls[m-2] - (1 if grid[n-3][m-2] == '*' else 0), print statements executed**

Explanation:
1. The first line `print('YES')` prints 'YES' to the console but does not modify any variables.
2. The second line `print(i + 1, j + 1)` prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the console, which are `n-1` and `m` respectively. This line also does not modify any variables.
3. Both lines together do not change the values of `i`, `j`, or `total_walls`. Therefore, the final state remains as described, with `i` being `n-2`, `j` being `m-1`, and `total_walls` being `row_walls[n-3] + col_walls[m-2] - (1 if grid[n-3][m-2] == '*' else 0)`.
