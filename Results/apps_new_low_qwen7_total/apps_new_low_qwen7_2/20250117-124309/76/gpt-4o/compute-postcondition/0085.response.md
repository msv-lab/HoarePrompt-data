Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m`, `m` must be at least 1, and `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) is not equal to total_walls`. If the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` is met, the program does not return any value. Otherwise, `j` remains `m`.***
