Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `j` is in the range from `2` to `m-1`, `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` are integers, and `grid[i][j]` is either `'*'` or not `'*'`. If `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls`, the condition holds true without any change to the variables. Otherwise, the condition does not hold, and the variables remain unchanged.***
