Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, if `grid[i][j]` equals '*', then `row_walls` at index `i` is incremented by 1, `col_walls` at index `j` is incremented by 1, and `total_walls` is incremented by 1. If `grid[i][j]` does not equal '*', no changes are made to `row_walls`, `col_walls`, or `total_walls`.***
