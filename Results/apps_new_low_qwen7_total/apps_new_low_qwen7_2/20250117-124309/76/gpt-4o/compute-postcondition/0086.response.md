Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `j` is `m`
   - `m` must be at least 1
   - The expression `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0)` is not equal to `total_walls`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` is met, the program does not return any value. Otherwise, `j` remains `m`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `m`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` should become `m+1`.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - `i` remains `n-1` because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `m` remains at least 1, but its exact value is not specified and does not change based on the loop.

7. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` still needs to be checked with the updated value of `j`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and the condition check.

**State:**
**`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m+1`, `m` must be at least 1, and `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) is not equal to total_walls`**
