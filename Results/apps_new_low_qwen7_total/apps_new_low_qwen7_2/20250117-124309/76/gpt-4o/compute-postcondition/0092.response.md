The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `m`, `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, or `total_walls`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `row_walls[i]` is the total count of '*' in the last row `n-1`, `col_walls[j]` is the total count of '*' in columns `j` where `0 <= j < m`, and `total_walls` is the sum of all `row_walls[i]` values (or equivalently, the sum of all `col_walls[j]` values).`**
