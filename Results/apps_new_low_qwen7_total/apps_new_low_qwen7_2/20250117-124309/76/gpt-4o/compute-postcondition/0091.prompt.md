Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `row_walls[i]` is equal to the number of columns `j` where `grid[i][j]` is '*', `col_walls[j]` is equal to the number of rows `i` where `grid[i][j]` is '*', and `total_walls` is the sum of all `row_walls[i]` values (or equivalently, the sum of all `col_walls[j]` values).

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over every element in the grid. The variable `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases until it reaches 0. The inner loop iterates over each column `j`.
- If `grid[i][j]` is '*', then `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` are incremented, and `total_walls` is also incremented.
- The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the grid that are '*'. Once all elements in the grid are checked, the loop stops.

By the time the loop completes, `i` will be 0 because the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to 0. The value of `m` remains unchanged since it is an invariant throughout the loop. The `row_walls` and `col_walls` arrays are updated based on the occurrences of '*' in the grid, and `total_walls` reflects the total count of '*' in the grid.

Thus, the final state of the program after the loop has executed is as described above.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0
            ) == total_walls:
            print('YES')
            print(i + 1, j + 1)
            return


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` are integers, `grid[i][j]` is either `'*'` or not `'*'`, and the loop will not print `YES` unless the condition is satisfied at some point.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-1`, and the loop does not execute.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: - `i` is `n-1`
  - `j` is either `m-1` or any value up to `m-1` (if the condition is not met before reaching `m-1`)
  - The loop will print 'YES' and coordinates `(i+1, j+1)` and return if the condition is met at any point during the loop.
  - If the condition is never met, the loop will not print anything.

Output State:


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
