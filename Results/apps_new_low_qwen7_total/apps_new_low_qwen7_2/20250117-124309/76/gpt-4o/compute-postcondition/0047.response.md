Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - There must be at least one column `j` such that `grid[n-1][j]` is '*'.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `m-1` (inclusive) using the variable `j`.

3. **Conditions for the First Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute even once, `j` must be within the valid range, i.e., `0` to `m-1`.
   - Additionally, we need to ensure that the condition `grid[n-1][j]` is '*' holds true for at least one value of `j` in this range.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The variable `j` will take values from `0` to `m-1` in each iteration.
   - The grid `grid[n-1]` must contain at least one '*' character at some index `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`.

Therefore, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `0` to `m-1`, and there must be at least one column `j` such that `grid[n-1][j]` is '*'**. 

This ensures that the loop can execute at least once, as there is a valid `j` where `grid[n-1][j]` is '*'.
