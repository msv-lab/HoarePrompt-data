State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `grid` contains [data[0]], `index` is 2** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`, which means the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
3. **Current State After Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `grid` contains `[data[0]]`, `index` is 1.
4. **Adjust `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 with each iteration, after `i` was 1, it will now be 2.
5. **Check Loop Continuation**: For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Given `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 to allow another iteration.
6. **No Change to `grid` or `index`**: The problem statement specifies that only the loop head variables (`i` and `n`) can be adjusted. The `grid` and `index` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` needs to be less than `n`)
- `grid` remains as `[data[0]]`
- `index` remains as 2
