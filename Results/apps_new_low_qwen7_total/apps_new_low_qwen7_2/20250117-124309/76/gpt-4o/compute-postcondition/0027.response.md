Output State: **i is 2, j is 2, row_walls[1] is 1, col_walls[1] is 1, total_walls is 1**

Explanation:
- The first line `row_walls[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the `row_walls` list by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, this makes `row_walls[1]` equal to 1 (assuming it was initialized to 0).
- The second line `col_walls[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the `col_walls` list by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, this makes `col_walls[1]` equal to 1 (assuming it was initialized to 0).
- The third line `total_walls += 1` increments the `total_walls` variable by 1, making it equal to 1 (assuming it was initialized to 0).

All other variables remain unchanged based on the provided code block.
