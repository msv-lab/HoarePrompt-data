Initial State: 
```
print('YES')
print(i + 1, j + 1)
```

Analysis:
- The first line `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console.
- The second line `print(i + 1, j + 1)` attempts to print the values of `i` and `j` incremented by 1. However, since `i` and `j` are not defined before this line, they will raise a NameError when the code tries to execute.

Since the variables `i` and `j` are not defined in the initial state and their values are required to be used in the print statements, we cannot proceed with the execution without defining these variables. Given the context, it seems like `i` and `j` should have some initial values to avoid the NameError.

Assuming the intent is to print the values of `i` and `j` which are 0 by default (as they are not defined), we can modify the code as follows:
```
i = 0
j = 0
print('YES')
print(i + 1, j + 1)
```

Final State:
```
print('YES')
print(0 + 1, 0 + 1)
```

Execution:
- The first line `print('YES')` prints 'YES'.
- The second line `print(0 + 1, 0 + 1)` prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`, which are 1 and 1 respectively.

Output State: **print('YES'), print(1, 1)**
