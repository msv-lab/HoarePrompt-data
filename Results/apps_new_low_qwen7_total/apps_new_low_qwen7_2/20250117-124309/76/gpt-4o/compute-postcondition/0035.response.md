Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `grid` is a 2D list where each cell that was `'*'` is now a part of the `row_walls` and `col_walls` counts, `row_walls[1]` is the count of `'*'` in the first row, `col_walls[j]` is the count of `'*'` in column `j` for each `j` in the range `0` to `m-1`, and `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire `grid`. The current value of `grid[i][j]` is `'*'`, `j` is 0**
