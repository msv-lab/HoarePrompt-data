State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `j` (the loop counter) and `m` (the upper bound of the loop).

2. **Loop Condition**: The condition for the loop to execute at least once is `j < m`.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0, but `n` is not involved in the loop's execution directly.

4. **First Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be less than `m`.

5. **Setting Initial Values**:
   - Since `j` is initialized within the loop (`range(m)`), it will start from 0 by default.
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `m` must be greater than 0.

6. **Conclusion**: The initial values of `i` and `n` are already given. The only requirement for the loop to execute the first time is that `m` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the required state is:

State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
