Output State: **i is 2, n is greater than 1, m is at least 2, row_walls[2] is 2, col_walls[1] is 2, total_walls is 2, grid is a 2D list, and if grid[i][j] equals '*', the condition remains as is.**

Explanation:
- The first line `row_walls[i] += 1` increments the value of `row_walls[i]` (where `i` is 2) by 1. Given that initially `row_walls[2]` is 1, it becomes 2.
- The second line `col_walls[j] += 1` increments the value of `col_walls[j]` (where `j` is 1) by 1. Given that initially `col_walls[1]` is 1, it becomes 2.
- The third line `total_walls += 1` increments the value of `total_walls` by 1. Given that initially `total_walls` is 1, it becomes 2.
- Variables `n` and `m` are not affected by these lines.
- The `grid` and the condition `if grid[i][j] equals '*'` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
