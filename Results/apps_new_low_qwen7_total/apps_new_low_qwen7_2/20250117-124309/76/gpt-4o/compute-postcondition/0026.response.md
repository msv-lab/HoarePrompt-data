The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1 (unchanged from the previous state)
- `j` is 0 (it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration)
- `m` is greater than 0 (unchanged from the previous state)
- `grid[1][0]` is either unchanged or set to '*' (unchanged from the previous state)

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `j` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 at the beginning of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0**
