Output State: **i is 0, m is greater than 0, row_walls[0] is 2, col_walls[1] is 2, total_walls is 2**

Explanation:
- The first line `row_walls[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the list `row_walls` by 1. Since `i` is 0, `row_walls[0]` changes from 1 to 2.
- The second line `col_walls[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the list `col_walls` by 1. However, `j` is not defined in the given code snippet, so we cannot determine its exact value. But since it is stated that `col_walls[1]` is initially 1, this line would change `col_walls[1]` from 1 to 2.
- The third line `total_walls += 1` increments the value of `total_walls` by 1, changing it from 1 to 2.
- The variable `m` is not modified by any of the lines, so it remains "greater than 0".
- The variable `i` is not modified by any of the lines, so it remains 0.
