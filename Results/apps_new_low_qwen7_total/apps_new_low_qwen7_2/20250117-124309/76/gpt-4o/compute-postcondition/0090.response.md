Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Initial State
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-1`

#### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(m):
    if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
        print('YES')
        print(i + 1, j + 1)
        return
```

#### Iteration Analysis

1. **First Iteration (`j=0`):**
   - The loop checks if `row_walls[i] + col_walls[0] - (1 if grid[i][0] == '*' else 0) == total_walls`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' and the coordinates `(i+1, j+1)` and returns. Since `i` is `n-1` and `j` is `m-1`, it will check `row_walls[n-1] + col_walls[0] - (1 if grid[n-1][0] == '*' else 0)`.
   - If the condition is false, `j` increments to `1`.

2. **Second Iteration (`j=1`):**
   - The loop checks if `row_walls[i] + col_walls[1] - (1 if grid[i][1] == '*' else 0) == total_walls`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' and the coordinates `(i+1, j+1)` and returns. Since `i` is `n-1`, it will check `row_walls[n-1] + col_walls[1] - (1 if grid[n-1][1] == '*' else 0)`.
   - If the condition is false, `j` increments to `2`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - The loop continues to increment `j` until it reaches `m-1`.
   - If none of the conditions `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` are true for any `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, the loop completes without printing anything.

#### Final State After All Iterations

- **Final Value of `i`:** `i` remains `n-1` because the loop only increments `j` and does not change `i`.
- **Final Value of `j`:** `j` can be either `m-1` or any value up to `m-1` depending on whether the condition in the loop was met. If the condition is never met, `j` will be `m-1`.
- **Conditions for Execution:** The loop will execute `m` times unless one of the conditions `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` is met before reaching `j=m-1`.

### Summary

- **Final Output State:**
  - `i` is `n-1`
  - `j` is either `m-1` or any value up to `m-1` (if the condition is not met before reaching `m-1`)
  - The loop will print 'YES' and coordinates `(i+1, j+1)` and return if the condition is met at any point during the loop.
  - If the condition is never met, the loop will not print anything.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1` or any value up to `m-1` if the condition is not met, and the loop will print 'YES' and coordinates `(i+1, j+1)` and return if the condition is met at any point during the loop.**
