Output State: **i is 2, n must be greater than 1, j is 1, m must be greater than 0, total_walls is 1, row_walls is a list with a value of 1 at index 1, col_walls is a list with a value of 1 at index 0, and grid[1][0] is '*'** 

Explanation:
- The first line `row_walls[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` (which is 1) in the `row_walls` list by 1. Since it starts as a list with all zeros (implied from the context), it becomes `[0, 1]`.
- The second line `col_walls[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` (which is 0) in the `col_walls` list by 1. This makes `col_walls` become `[1, 0]`.
- The third line `total_walls += 1` increments the `total_walls` counter by 1, making it equal to 1.

Note: The values of `n` and `m` are not directly manipulated by the given code, so they remain as per the initial conditions. The value of `grid[i][j]` is also updated to '*' according to the initial condition, but this is not directly shown in the state update.
