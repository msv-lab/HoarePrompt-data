You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) representing the number of rows and columns in the depot field. The following n lines contain m symbols "." and "*" each, representing the cells in the field. Each symbol "." indicates an empty cell, and each symbol "*" indicates a cell occupied by a wall.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

n = int(data[0])

m = int(data[1])

grid = []

index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        grid.append(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i is n-1, grid contains [data[2], data[3], ..., data[n+1]], index is 2 + n.
    row_walls = [0] * n

col_walls = [0] * m

total_walls = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == '*':
                row_walls[i] += 1
                col_walls[j] += 1
                total_walls += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `row_walls[i]` is equal to the number of columns `j` where `grid[i][j]` is '*', `col_walls[j]` is equal to the number of rows `i` where `grid[i][j]` is '*', and `total_walls` is the sum of all `row_walls[i]` values (or equivalently, the sum of all `col_walls[j]` values).
    #
    #Explanation:
    #- The loop iterates over every element in the grid. The variable `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases until it reaches 0. The inner loop iterates over each column `j`.
    #- If `grid[i][j]` is '*', then `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` are incremented, and `total_walls` is also incremented.
    #- The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the grid that are '*'. Once all elements in the grid are checked, the loop stops.
    #
    #By the time the loop completes, `i` will be 0 because the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to 0. The value of `m` remains unchanged since it is an invariant throughout the loop. The `row_walls` and `col_walls` arrays are updated based on the occurrences of '*' in the grid, and `total_walls` reflects the total count of '*' in the grid.
    #
    #Thus, the final state of the program after the loop has executed is as described above.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0
                ) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `0`, `m` is greater than 0, `row_walls[i]` is the total count of '*' in the last row `n-1`, `col_walls[j]` is the total count of '*' in columns `j` where `0 <= j < m`, and `total_walls` is the sum of all `row_walls[i]` values (or equivalently, the sum of all `col_walls[j]` values).
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. The function processes a depot field represented by a grid of n rows and m columns, where each cell is either an empty cell indicated by "." or a cell occupied by a wall indicated by "*". Based on the conditions specified, the function can have different behaviors:
#
#- Case_1: The function does not return anything.
#- Case_2: The function does not return anything.
#- Case_3: The function does not return anything.
#- Case_4: The function returns `None`.
#- Case_5: The function does not return anything.
#- Case_6: The function does not return anything.
#- Case_7: The function does not return anything.
#- Case_8: The function does not return anything.
#- Case_9: The function prints 'YES' and 1, 1 and returns `None`.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process a depot field grid and based on certain conditions, either return `None`, print and return, or not return anything at all.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: None

Case_2: The program does not return any value

Case_3: The program does not return any value

Case_4: The program returns None

Case_5: None

Case_6: None

Case_7: None

Case_8: The program does not return any value

Case_9: The program prints 'YES' and 1, 1 and returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
