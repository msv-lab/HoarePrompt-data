Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(m)`, so the variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `j` is `m-1`
   - `m` must be at least 1
   - `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) is not equal to total_walls`

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently `m-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `m`.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to start, not something that changes within the loop.

Given these points, let's update the states accordingly:

- `i` remains `n-1` because `i` is not part of the loop head.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from `m-1` to `m`.
- `m` remains at least 1.
- The expression `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0)` must not be equal to `total_walls` for the loop to continue. With `j` now being `m`, this condition still holds unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the updated states are:

**State: `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m`, `m` must be at least 1, `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) is not equal to total_walls`**
