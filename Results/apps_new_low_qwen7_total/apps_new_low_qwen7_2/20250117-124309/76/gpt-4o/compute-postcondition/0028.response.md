Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0. If `grid[i][j]` equals '*', then `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `row_walls[1]` is 1, `col_walls[1]` is 1, and `total_walls` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, `row_walls[1]`, `col_walls[1]`, and `total_walls` remain as they were initially.***
