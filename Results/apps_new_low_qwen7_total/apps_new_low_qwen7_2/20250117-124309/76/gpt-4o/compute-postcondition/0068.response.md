Output State: **i is n-2, j is m, row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) is not equal to total_walls, print statements executed**

Explanation:
1. The first line `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console.
2. The second line `print(i + 1, j + 1)` prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the console.
3. None of these lines modify the values of `i`, `j`, `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0)`, or `total_walls`. They only affect the output of the program.

Therefore, the initial values of `i`, `j`, `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0)`, and `total_walls` remain unchanged, and the print statements are executed.
