The initial state is: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```
grid.append(data[index])
index += 1
```

Let's analyze the impact of each line on the variables:

1. `grid.append(data[index])`: This line appends the value at `data[index]` to the `grid` list. However, since `data` is not defined in the initial state and no value for `data` is given, we cannot determine what exactly gets appended to `grid`. But we know that `grid` gains one element which is `data[index]`.

2. `index += 1`: This line increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` is not defined, but assuming it starts from 0 (common default for such indices), after this line, `index` would be 1.

Since `data` is not defined and no specific value for `i` or `n` is updated or used in these lines, the only variables that change are `grid` and `index`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `n` remains greater than 0 as there is no operation affecting it.

Therefore, the final output state, based on the given code and initial conditions, is:
Output State: **i is 1, n must be greater than 0, grid contains [data[0]], index is 1**
