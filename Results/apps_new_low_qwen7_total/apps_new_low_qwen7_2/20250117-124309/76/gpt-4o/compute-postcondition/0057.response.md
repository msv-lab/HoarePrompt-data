Output State: **i is n-1, j is 2 to m-1, row_walls[i] is an integer, col_walls[j] is an integer, grid[i][j] is either '*' or not '*', print statements 'YES' and i + 1, j + 1 have been executed** 

Explanation: The code block prints two lines: "YES" and "i + 1, j + 1". These print statements do not modify any variables but output their values. The initial values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, as well as the values of `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]`. The value of `grid[i][j]` also remains the same, being either `'*'` or not `'*'`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while noting that the specified print statements have been executed.
