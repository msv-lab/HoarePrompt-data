The initial state is: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```
grid.append(data[index])
index += 1
```

This code snippet consists of two lines:
1. `grid.append(data[index])`: This line appends the element at the index `index` of the list `data` to the list `grid`.
2. `index += 1`: This line increments the value of `index` by 1.

However, there are no predefined lists `grid` and `data` or values for `index` and `n` (other than the condition that `n` must be greater than 0) in the initial state. Without these definitions, we cannot proceed with the exact calculation. But based on the given instructions, we can infer the following:
- `grid` will be initialized as an empty list if it isn't already.
- `data` is assumed to be a list containing elements.
- `index` will start at 0 and will be incremented by 1 after the first execution of the line.

Since the exact nature of `data` is not specified, let's assume `data` is defined somewhere else in the context and starts with at least one element, say `data = [1]` for simplicity.

Given this assumption, here's the updated state after executing the code snippet:
- `grid` becomes `[1]` because `data[0]` (which is 1) is appended to `grid`.
- `index` becomes 1 because it is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **i is 0, n is greater than 0, grid is [1], index is 1**
