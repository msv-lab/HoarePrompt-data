The first line appends the element at the index `data[index]` to the list `grid`. Given that `index` is initially 2, it appends `data[2]` to `grid`. However, since the initial state only specifies that `grid` contains `[data[0]]`, we need to assume or infer the value of `data[0]` and `data[2]` based on typical context (often, such problems imply default values if not specified). For simplicity, let's assume `data[0]` and `data[2]` are integers (e.g., 0 and 2, respectively), which is a common assumption when no specific values are given.

The second line increments `index` by 1, so `index` becomes 3.

Given these operations, the updated state is:
- `i` remains 2
- `n` remains greater than 0 (no change to this condition or value)
- `grid` now contains `data[0]` and `data[2]`, which we assumed to be 0 and 2, respectively, so `grid` becomes `[0, 2]`
- `index` becomes 3

Output State: **i is 2, n is greater than 0, grid is [0, 2], index is 3**
