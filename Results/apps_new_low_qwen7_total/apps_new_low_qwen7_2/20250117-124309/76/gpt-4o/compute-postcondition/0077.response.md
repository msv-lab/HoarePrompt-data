Let's break down the given task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(m)`. This means the loop variable is `j`, and the control variable is `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**: Before the loop starts, we are given that `i` is `n-1` and `j` is `m-1`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. 

4. **Determine the necessary conditions for the first iteration**:
   - For the first iteration of the loop, `j` should be less than `m`.
   - Given that `j` is initially `m-1`, the loop will execute the first time because `j < m` (i.e., `m-1 < m` is always true).

5. **State the required conditions for the first execution of the loop**:
   - `i` remains `n-1` since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `j` must be `m-1` to start the loop.
   - `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at all.

Therefore, the state before the first execution of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `m` must be at least 1**.
