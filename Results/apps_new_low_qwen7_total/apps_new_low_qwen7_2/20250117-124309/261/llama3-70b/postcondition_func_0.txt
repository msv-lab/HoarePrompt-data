The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and returns the count of '1' bits in the binary representation of `n`. The function iterates through each bit of `n`, counting the number of '1' bits until `n` becomes 0. After the function completes, the state of the program is that `count` contains the total number of '1' bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.
