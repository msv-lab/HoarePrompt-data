The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `m` (a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\)). It searches for the smallest integer `n` such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2*n)\) for which `func_1(i) == k` equals `m`. If such an `n` is found, it returns `n`. If no such `n` is found within a reasonable number of iterations (determined by the while loop condition), the function will continue to search until it finds the correct `n` or exhausts a practical limit, ensuring that the function will eventually return a valid result.
