#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The function `func_1` counts the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of n.
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1
        
        n >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is 0 and count is the number of 1s in the binary representation of the original n.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the number of 1s in the binary representation of the original n (which is 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and returns the count of '1' bits in the binary representation of `n`. The function iterates through each bit of `n`, counting the number of '1' bits until `n` becomes 0. After the function completes, the state of the program is that `count` contains the total number of '1' bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 10^18, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 64.
def func_2(m, k):
    n = 1
    while True:
        count = sum(1 for i in range(n + 1, 2 * n + 1) if func_1(i) == k)
        
        if count == m:
            return n
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\); `n` is the smallest integer such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2*n)\) for which `func_1(i) == k` equals `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `m` (a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\)). It searches for the smallest integer `n` such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2*n)\) for which `func_1(i) == k` equals `m`. If such an `n` is found, it returns `n`. If no such `n` is found within a reasonable number of iterations (determined by the while loop condition), the function will continue to search until it finds the correct `n` or exhausts a practical limit, ensuring that the function will eventually return a valid result.
