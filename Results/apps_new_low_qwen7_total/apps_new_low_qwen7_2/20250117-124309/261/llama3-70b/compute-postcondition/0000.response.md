The variable `n` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `m` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 64, `n` is 1.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 64, `n` is 1**
