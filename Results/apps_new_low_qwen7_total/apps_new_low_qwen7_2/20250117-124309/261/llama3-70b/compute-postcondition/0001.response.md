Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `while True` loop means the loop will execute indefinitely as long as it does not encounter a break statement or similar control flow mechanism inside the loop.
2. Since the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once, there is no condition to check for the first iteration.
3. Therefore, no modification is needed to the current state of the variables for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 64, `n` is 1**
