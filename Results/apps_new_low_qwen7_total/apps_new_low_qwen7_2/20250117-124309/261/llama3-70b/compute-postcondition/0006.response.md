`n` is incremented by 1, so `n` becomes 2. The value of `count`, `m`, and `k` remains unchanged, and the condition that `count` is not equal to `m` is still valid.

Output State: **`count` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `func_1(2)` returns `k` or not; `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 64; `n` is 2; `count` is not equal to `m`.**
