Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of integers in the range [4, 5, 6] for which `func_1(i)` returns `k`; `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\); `n` is 3. If `count` equals `m`, the function returns 3. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or the behavior remains unchanged as no return is specified).***
