The code initializes `count` based on the return value of `func_1(i)` for each `i` in the range from `n + 1` to `2 * n`. Given that `n` is 2, this translates to the range from 3 to 4.

Since `func_1(i)` returns `k` only when `i` is within the specified range (which is 3 and 4 in this case), the `count` will be the number of times `func_1(i)` returns `k` for `i` in [3, 4].

Given the initial state:
- `count` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `func_1(2)` returns `k` or not.
- `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\).
- `n` is 2.
- `count` is not equal to `m`.

The new `count` will be calculated as follows:
- For `i = 3`, `func_1(3)` is checked.
- For `i = 4`, `func_1(4)` is checked.

The `count` will be incremented by 1 for each time `func_1(i)` returns `k`.

The initial value of `count` was determined by `func_1(2)`, which means `count` is either 1 or 0. After running the code, `count` will be updated based on the outcomes of `func_1(3)` and `func_1(4)`.

If `func_1(3)` returns `k` and `func_1(4)` returns `k`, `count` will be 2.
If only one of them returns `k`, `count` will be 1.
If neither returns `k`, `count` will remain 0.

However, since the initial value of `count` is already either 1 or 0, and the code increments `count` based on the outcome of `func_1(i)`, the possible final values of `count` will be either 1 or 2.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`count` is either 1 or 2; `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\); `n` is 2; `count` is not equal to `m`**
