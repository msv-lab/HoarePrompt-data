The `while True` loop does not depend on any variables inside the loop, meaning there are no conditions to check before proceeding to the next iteration. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute at least one more time regardless of the current values of the variables.

State: **`count` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `func_1(2)` returns `k` or not; `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 64; `n` is 2; `count` is not equal to `m`**
