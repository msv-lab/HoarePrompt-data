`n` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of the other variables (`count`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged. The initial conditions and their constraints are still valid.

Output State: **`count` is the number of integers in the range [4, 5, 6] for which `func_1(i)` returns `k`; `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\); `n` is 4.**
