### Analysis and Solution

#### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop continues indefinitely until the condition `count == m` is met. The variable `count` is defined as the number of integers in the range `[n, 2*n)` for which `func_1(i) == k`.

#### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- `n` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
- `count` is recalculated based on the current value of `n`.
- `m` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop.

#### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue to increment `n` and update `count` until `count` equals `m`. The loop's behavior can be summarized as follows:
- Initially, `n` starts at 1.
- In each iteration, `n` is incremented by 1.
- `count` is recalculated for the range `[n, 2*n)`.
- The loop exits when `count == m`.

#### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- The loop will eventually exit when `count` matches `m`.
- The value of `n` when the loop exits will be the smallest integer such that there are exactly `m` numbers in the range `[n, 2*n)` for which `func_1(i) == k`.

### Output State After All Executions of the Loop
Given the analysis, we need to find the value of `n` where the condition `count == m` holds true. 

Since `count` is the number of integers in the range `[n, 2*n)` for which `func_1(i) == k`, the loop will terminate when this count matches `m`.

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `n` will be the smallest integer such that the number of integers in the range `[n, 2*n)` for which `func_1(i) == k` equals `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\); `n` is the smallest integer such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2*n)\) for which `func_1(i) == k` equals `m`.**
