Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `m` (a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\)). It searches for the smallest integer `n` such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2*n)\) for which `func_1(i) == k` equals `m`. If such an `n` is found, it returns `n`. If no such `n` is found within a reasonable number of iterations (determined by the while loop condition), the function will continue to search until it finds the correct `n` or exhausts a practical limit, ensuring that the function will eventually return a valid result.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `m` is 0, the function will return `n` where the count of `i` in the range \([n, 2*n)\) satisfying `func_1(i) == k` is 0, which could be 0 itself depending on the behavior of `func_1`.
- If `m` is very close to the maximum value of \(10^{18}\) and the count of `i` satisfying `func_1(i) == k` in the range \([n, 2*n)\) increases by only one each iteration, the function might take a long time to execute, potentially leading to an indefinite loop if no practical limit is set.

**Missing functionality:**
- The annotation mentions that the function returns 1, 2, or 3, but the actual code does not explicitly handle these cases. Instead, the function returns the smallest integer `n` that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the annotation should be corrected to reflect the actual behavior of the function, which is to return the smallest `n` such that the count of integers in the specified range matches `m`.

In summary, the function will return the smallest integer `n` such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2*n)\) for which `func_1(i) == k` equals `m`, or it will continue searching until it finds a valid `n`. If no valid `n` is found within a practical limit, the function will eventually return a valid result.
