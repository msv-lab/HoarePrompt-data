The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `m` and `k`. `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\). The function has three possible return values: 1, 2, or 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two parameters, `m` (a non-negative integer within a specific range) and `k` (a positive integer within a specific range), and return either 1, 2, or 3 based on certain conditions.
