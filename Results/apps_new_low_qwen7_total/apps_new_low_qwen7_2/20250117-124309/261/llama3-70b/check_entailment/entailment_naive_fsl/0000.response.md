Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not accurately count the number of integers between `n + 1` and `2 * n` whose binary representation contains exactly `k` ones. 

For instance, consider the input `m = 1` and `k = 1`. According to the problem description, we need to find an `n` such that exactly one number in the range `[n + 1, 2 * n]` has exactly one '1' in its binary representation. For `n = 1`, the range is `[2, 2]`, which only contains the number `2` (binary `10`), but this does not satisfy the condition since it does not contain exactly one '1'. However, `n = 2` would be a valid solution because the range is `[3, 4]` and the number `3` (binary `11`) contains exactly one '1', and `4` (binary `100`) does not.

The current implementation of `func_2` does not ensure that exactly `m` numbers meet the criteria. It simply increments `n` until it finds an `n` where the count of numbers meeting the criteria is equal to `m`, without ensuring that no other numbers in the range have the exact count of `k` ones.

To fix this, the program needs to properly count the numbers in the specified range that meet the criteria and ensure that exactly `m` such numbers exist. The current logic does not guarantee this.
