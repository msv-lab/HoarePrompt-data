### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that `func_2` correctly finds an `n` such that there are exactly `m` numbers between `n + 1` and `2 * n` whose binary representation contains exactly `k` ones.

1. **Binary Representation Count (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of ones in the binary representation of a given number `n`.
   - It uses bitwise operations to iterate through each bit of `n`, incrementing a counter whenever it encounters a `1`.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` iteratively increases `n` and checks how many numbers between `n + 1` and `2 * n` have exactly `k` ones in their binary representation using `func_1`.
   - If the count matches `m`, it returns the current value of `n`.
   - The loop continues until a valid `n` is found.

Given that the problem guarantees that there is an answer within the range of \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the loop will eventually find such an `n`.

Since both functions are logically sound and meet the requirements specified in the problem statement, the given program should work correctly.

### Conclusion:

- The logic for counting ones in a binary number is correct.
- The main function correctly searches for the desired `n` and ensures that the count of numbers with exactly `k` ones is `m`.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
