### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of an integer `n`.
   - It iterates through each bit of `n`, counting how many times `1` appears.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function aims to find the smallest integer `n` such that exactly `m` integers in the range `[n+1, 2*n)` have exactly `k` ones in their binary representation.
   - It initializes `n` to 1 and increments `n` until it finds an `n` that satisfies the condition.
   - For each value of `n`, it uses `func_1` to count how many integers in the range `[n+1, 2*n)` have exactly `k` ones in their binary representation using a generator expression inside `sum`.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads `m` and `k` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_2(m, k)` to find the required `n`.
   - The logic within `func_2` is correct because:
     - It correctly checks the range `[n+1, 2*n)` for each value of `n`.
     - It uses `func_1` to count the number of '1' bits in each integer within this range.
     - It stops when it finds the correct `n`.

Given that the logic and functions appear to be implemented correctly and align with the problem statement, the annotated program should produce the correct output for the given constraints.
