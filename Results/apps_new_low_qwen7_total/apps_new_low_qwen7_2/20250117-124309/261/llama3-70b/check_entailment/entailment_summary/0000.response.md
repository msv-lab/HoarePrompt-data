Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding a positive integer \( n \) such that among the numbers from \( n+1 \) to \( 2n \), there are exactly \( m \) numbers whose binary representation contains exactly \( k \) ones.
2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly counts the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of a given integer \( n \).
3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function iteratively increases \( n \) starting from 1.
   - For each \( n \), it counts how many numbers in the range \( [n+1, 2n) \) have exactly \( k \) ones in their binary representation using `func_1`.
   - If this count matches \( m \), it returns \( n \).
   - If not, it continues to the next \( n \).

Given the execution summary and the logic of the functions:
- `func_1` correctly counts the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of a number.
- `func_2` correctly finds the smallest \( n \) such that the specified condition holds.

Since both functions work as intended and `func_2` ensures that it will find a solution within the constraints (as per the problem statement), the overall program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
