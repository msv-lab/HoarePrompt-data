### Reasoning:

Let's break down the code and the logic step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

1. **Binary Representation Count (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of ones in the binary representation of a given number `n`.
   - It uses bitwise operations to iterate through each bit of `n`, incrementing a counter whenever it encounters a `1`.
   - This part of the code is logically sound and works as expected.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` starts with `n = 1` and iteratively increases `n` until it finds a value where the number of integers between `n + 1` and `2 * n` that have exactly `k` ones in their binary representation equals `m`.
   - For each value of `n`, it calculates the count of numbers between `n + 1` and `2 * n` with exactly `k` ones using `func_1`.
   - If this count equals `m`, it returns the current value of `n`.

### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop in `func_2` will terminate because the problem guarantees that there is a solution within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - Since the function increments `n` by 1 in each iteration, the loop will eventually find an `n` that satisfies the condition.

2. **Count Calculation**:
   - The count calculation inside the loop uses `func_1` to check the number of ones in the binary representation of each number in the range `[n + 1, 2 * n)`.
   - This is done using a generator expression inside the `sum` function, which is a correct and efficient way to count the numbers meeting the criteria.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases well since it ensures that the count is checked within the specified range and the loop will not run indefinitely due to the problem constraints.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**:
  - `(m, k) = map(int, input().split())`: Correctly reads the input values.
  - `print(func_2(m, k))`: Calls the main function with the input values.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The state transitions are correct: `count` accumulates the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `n`, and the loop terminates when `n` becomes zero.
  - Returns the correct count of `1`s.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The state transitions are correct: `n` is incremented in each iteration, and the loop continues until the count matches `m`.
  - Returns the correct value of `n`.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and the logic, the original assessment is accurate. Both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly implement the required functionality and handle the problem constraints appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
