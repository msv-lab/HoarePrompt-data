Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding a positive integer \( n \) such that exactly \( m \) numbers in the range from \( n+1 \) to \( 2 \cdot n \) have exactly \( k \) ones in their binary representation.

2. The given solution consists of two functions:
   - `func_1(n)`: This function correctly counts the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of \( n \).
   - `func_2(m, k)`: This function iteratively searches for the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies the condition. It does so by:
     - Starting with \( n = 1 \).
     - For each \( n \), it calculates the number of integers in the range \([n, 2 \cdot n)\) that have exactly \( k \) ones in their binary representation using `func_1(i)`.
     - If this count matches \( m \), it returns \( n \).
     - Otherwise, it increments \( n \) and repeats the process.

3. Given the constraints:
   - \( 0 \leq m \leq 10^{18} \)
   - \( 1 \leq k \leq 64 \)
   - \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \)

   The logic in `func_2` ensures that it will find a valid \( n \) because:
   - The function will increment \( n \) until the condition is met.
   - Since the problem guarantees that there is a solution, the function will eventually find it.

4. The overall approach and implementation are correct. The functions handle the input constraints appropriately, and the iterative search mechanism is sound.

Conclusion:
The given program is correct in meeting the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
