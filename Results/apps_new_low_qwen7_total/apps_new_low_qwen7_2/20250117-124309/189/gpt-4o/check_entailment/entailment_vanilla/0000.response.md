### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if it's possible to place all soldiers in the airplane such that no two soldiers from different groups sit in neighboring seats. Let's analyze the logic of the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input and splits it into parts. It correctly extracts the number of rows (`n`) and the number of groups (`k`), and then it processes the number of soldiers in each group.
   
2. **Total Pairs Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of pairs of seats needed, considering that each pair can accommodate one soldier from one group without violating the neighboring rule. Specifically, it uses the formula `(soldiers + 1) // 2` to calculate the number of pairs required for each group, ensuring that even if a group has an odd number of soldiers, it still gets at least one pair of seats.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if the total number of pairs needed can fit within the available pairs per row multiplied by the number of rows. Since each row has 4 pairs of neighboring seats, the maximum number of pairs per row is `4 * n`.

4. **Output**: Based on the feasibility check, it prints "YES" if the arrangement is possible or "NO" otherwise.

The program logic seems sound, but let's verify its correctness against the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `2 2 5 8`
  - Total pairs needed: `(5 + 1) // 2 + (8 + 1) // 2 = 3 + 4 = 7`
  - Maximum pairs available: `4 * 2 = 8`
  - Result: "YES"

- **Example 2**: `1 2 7 1`
  - Total pairs needed: `(7 + 1) // 2 + (1 + 1) // 2 = 4 + 1 = 5`
  - Maximum pairs available: `4 * 1 = 4`
  - Result: "NO"

- **Example 3**: `1 2 4 4`
  - Total pairs needed: `(4 + 1) // 2 + (4 + 1) // 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`
  - Maximum pairs available: `4 * 1 = 4`
  - Result: "YES"

- **Example 4**: `1 4 2 2 1 2`
  - Total pairs needed: `(2 + 1) // 2 + (2 + 1) // 2 + (1 + 1) // 2 + (2 + 1) // 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`
  - Maximum pairs available: `4 * 1 = 4`
  - Result: "YES"

After reviewing the logic and verifying with the provided examples, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution.

### Correctness:

**True**
