You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Daenerys Targaryen has an army consisting of k groups of soldiers, the i-th group contains a_{i} soldiers. She wants to bring her army to the other side of the sea to get the Iron Throne. She has recently bought an airplane to carry her army through the sea. The airplane has n rows, each of them has 8 seats. We call two seats neighbor, if they are in the same row and in seats {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6} or {7, 8}.

 [Image] A row in the airplane 

Daenerys Targaryen wants to place her army in the plane so that there are no two soldiers from different groups sitting on neighboring seats.

Your task is to determine if there is a possible arranging of her army in the airplane such that the condition above is satisfied.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of rows and the number of groups of soldiers, respectively.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10000), where a_{i} denotes the number of soldiers in the i-th group.

It is guaranteed that a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{k} ≤ 8·n.


-----Output-----

If we can place the soldiers in the airplane print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2
5 8

Output
YES

Input
1 2
7 1

Output
NO

Input
1 2
4 4

Output
YES

Input
1 4
2 2 1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Daenerys can place the soldiers like in the figure below:

 [Image] 

In the second sample, there is no way to place the soldiers in the plane since the second group soldier will always have a seat neighboring to someone from the first group.

In the third example Daenerys can place the first group on seats (1, 2, 7, 8), and the second group an all the remaining seats.

In the fourth example she can place the first two groups on seats (1, 2) and (7, 8), the third group on seats (3), and the fourth group on seats (5, 6).

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    k = int(data[1])
    groups = list(map(int, data[2:]))
    max_pairs_per_row = 4 * n
    total_pairs_needed = 0
    for soldiers in groups:
        total_pairs_needed += (soldiers + 1) // 2
    if total_pairs_needed <= max_pairs_per_row:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and the list a is a list of k integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10000 and the sum of all a_i's is less than or equal to 8*n.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

n = int(data[0])

k = int(data[1])

groups = list(map(int, data[2:]))

max_pairs_per_row = 4 * n

total_pairs_needed = 0
    for soldiers in groups:
        total_pairs_needed += (soldiers + 1) // 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `groups` is an empty list, `soldiers` is not used as the variable is only declared within the loop, `total_pairs_needed` is the sum of `(soldiers + 1) // 2` for each element in the original `groups`.
    if (total_pairs_needed <= max_pairs_per_row) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`groups` is an empty list, `soldiers` is not used as the variable is only declared within the loop. If `total_pairs_needed` is less than or equal to `max_pairs_per_row`, no specific action is taken (implied). If `total_pairs_needed` is greater than `max_pairs_per_row`, 'NO' is printed to the console.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the soldiers can be placed such that no two soldiers from different groups sit on neighboring seats. 

The core issue lies in the calculation of `total_pairs_needed`. The formula `(soldiers + 1) // 2` is used to calculate the number of pairs needed for each group, but this approach does not account for the specific constraints of the problem. For example, consider the following input:

```
1 2
7 1
```

According to the problem description, the second group (with 1 soldier) can be placed alone without needing a pair. However, the program incorrectly calculates the need for pairs, leading to an incorrect output of "NO".

A correct approach would involve checking if the total number of soldiers from each group can be placed such that the constraints are met. Specifically, the program needs to ensure that each group can be placed in a way that avoids placing soldiers from different groups in neighboring seats.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    k = int(data[1])
    groups = list(map(int, data[2:]))

    # Calculate the maximum number of pairs we can form per row
    max_pairs_per_row = 4 * n

    # Check if we can place all groups in the airplane
    for soldiers in groups:
        # We can place soldiers in pairs, but we also need to consider individual placements
        # Each group needs at least (soldiers + 1) // 2 pairs
        if (soldiers + 1) // 2 > max_pairs_per_row:
            print('NO')
            return

    # If we reach here, it means we can place all groups
    print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly checks if the groups can be placed according to the constraints.
