You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Daenerys Targaryen has an army consisting of k groups of soldiers, the i-th group contains a_{i} soldiers. She wants to bring her army to the other side of the sea to get the Iron Throne. She has recently bought an airplane to carry her army through the sea. The airplane has n rows, each of them has 8 seats. We call two seats neighbor, if they are in the same row and in seats {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6} or {7, 8}.

 [Image] A row in the airplane 

Daenerys Targaryen wants to place her army in the plane so that there are no two soldiers from different groups sitting on neighboring seats.

Your task is to determine if there is a possible arranging of her army in the airplane such that the condition above is satisfied.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of rows and the number of groups of soldiers, respectively.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10000), where a_{i} denotes the number of soldiers in the i-th group.

It is guaranteed that a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{k} ≤ 8·n.


-----Output-----

If we can place the soldiers in the airplane print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2
5 8

Output
YES

Input
1 2
7 1

Output
NO

Input
1 2
4 4

Output
YES

Input
1 4
2 2 1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Daenerys can place the soldiers like in the figure below:

 [Image] 

In the second sample, there is no way to place the soldiers in the plane since the second group soldier will always have a seat neighboring to someone from the first group.

In the third example Daenerys can place the first group on seats (1, 2, 7, 8), and the second group an all the remaining seats.

In the fourth example she can place the first two groups on seats (1, 2) and (7, 8), the third group on seats (3), and the fourth group on seats (5, 6).

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    k = int(data[1])
    groups = list(map(int, data[2:]))
    max_pairs_per_row = 4 * n
    total_pairs_needed = 0
    for soldiers in groups:
        total_pairs_needed += (soldiers + 1) // 2
    if total_pairs_needed <= max_pairs_per_row:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads input from standard input, processes a list of integers representing groups of soldiers, and determines whether the total number of pairs needed, where each pair consists of at least one soldier, can fit within a maximum limit. It then prints 'YES' if the total number of pairs is less than or equal to four times the value of \( n \), otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on values read from standard input, and returns no explicit value. After execution, the `groups` list is empty, and the program prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition. Potential edge cases include when the input does not conform to the specified constraints (e.g., invalid integers or lengths).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if it's possible to place all soldiers in the airplane such that no two soldiers from different groups sit in neighboring seats. Let's analyze the logic of the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input and splits it into parts. It correctly extracts the number of rows (`n`) and the number of groups (`k`), and then it processes the number of soldiers in each group.
   
2. **Total Pairs Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of pairs of seats needed, considering that each pair can accommodate one soldier from one group without violating the neighboring rule. Specifically, it uses the formula `(soldiers + 1) // 2` to calculate the number of pairs required for each group, ensuring that even if a group has an odd number of soldiers, it still gets at least one pair of seats.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if the total number of pairs needed can fit within the available pairs per row multiplied by the number of rows. Since each row has 4 pairs of neighboring seats, the maximum number of pairs per row is `4 * n`.

4. **Output**: Based on the feasibility check, it prints "YES" if the arrangement is possible or "NO" otherwise.

The program logic seems sound, but let's verify its correctness against the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `2 2 5 8`
  - Total pairs needed: `(5 + 1) // 2 + (8 + 1) // 2 = 3 + 4 = 7`
  - Maximum pairs available: `4 * 2 = 8`
  - Result: "YES"

- **Example 2**: `1 2 7 1`
  - Total pairs needed: `(7 + 1) // 2 + (1 + 1) // 2 = 4 + 1 = 5`
  - Maximum pairs available: `4 * 1 = 4`
  - Result: "NO"

- **Example 3**: `1 2 4 4`
  - Total pairs needed: `(4 + 1) // 2 + (4 + 1) // 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`
  - Maximum pairs available: `4 * 1 = 4`
  - Result: "YES"

- **Example 4**: `1 4 2 2 1 2`
  - Total pairs needed: `(2 + 1) // 2 + (2 + 1) // 2 + (1 + 1) // 2 + (2 + 1) // 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`
  - Maximum pairs available: `4 * 1 = 4`
  - Result: "YES"

After reviewing the logic and verifying with the provided examples, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution.
