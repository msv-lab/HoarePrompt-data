Reasoning:
1. The program reads input correctly and splits it into the number of rows (`n`), the number of groups (`k`), and the sizes of each group (`groups`).
2. The logic to calculate the total number of pairs needed is correct. Each group requires at least half of its size rounded up to form pairs. This is done using the expression `(soldiers + 1) // 2`.
3. The condition `total_pairs_needed <= max_pairs_per_row` checks if the total number of pairs needed can fit within the available number of pairs (4 rows with 2 pairs per row).
4. The output is correctly printed as 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition.

Given these points, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the annotated description.

Correctness: **True**
