Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in this case is `soldiers`, and the other relevant variables are `groups`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The `for` loop iterates over each element in the `groups` list. This means that for the loop to execute the first time, `groups` must contain at least one element.

3. **Initial Values**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10000\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\).
   - `groups` is a list of `k` integers.
   - `max_pairs_per_row` is \(4 \times n\).
   - `total_pairs_needed` is 0 (this is irrelevant to the loop condition).

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, the list `groups` must have at least one element. Since `groups` is a list of `k` integers and \(1 \leq k \leq 100\), `k` must be at least 1.

5. **State at the Start of the Loop**:
   - `groups` must have at least one element, i.e., the length of `groups` should be 1 or more.
   - `soldiers` will take the value of the first element in `groups` during the first iteration.

Thus, the state that must hold true for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: **`groups` must have at least one element, i.e., its length is 1 or more, and `soldiers` is the first element in the list `groups`.**
