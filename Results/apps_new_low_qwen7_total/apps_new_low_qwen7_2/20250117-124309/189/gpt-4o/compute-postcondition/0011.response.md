The code `print('NO')` does not affect the values of the variables. It simply prints 'NO' to the console. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`groups` is an empty list, `soldiers` is not used as the variable is only declared within the loop, `total_pairs_needed` is the sum of `(soldiers + 1) // 2` for each element in the original `groups`, `total_pairs_needed` is greater than `max_pairs_per_row`, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
