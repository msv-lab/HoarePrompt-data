Functionality: **The function reads input from standard input, processes a list of integers representing groups of soldiers, and determines whether the total number of pairs needed, where each pair consists of at least one soldier, can fit within a maximum limit. It then prints 'YES' if the total number of pairs is less than or equal to four times the value of \( n \), otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on values read from standard input, and returns no explicit value. After execution, the `groups` list is empty, and the program prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition. Potential edge cases include when the input does not conform to the specified constraints (e.g., invalid integers or lengths).**
