Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case where the total sum of the sequence is already odd. In this scenario, it directly prints the total sum.
2. When the total sum is even, the program aims to maximize the subsequence sum by either removing the smallest positive odd number or the largest negative odd number.
3. The program correctly initializes `min_positive_odd` to infinity (`float('inf')`) and `max_negative_odd` to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), ensuring that any actual positive odd number will replace infinity and any negative odd number will replace negative infinity.
4. The logic for calculating `result1` and `result2` ensures that if there are no positive odd numbers, `result1` will effectively be `total_sum`, and if there are no negative odd numbers, `result2` will also be `total_sum`.
5. The final print statement outputs the maximum value between `result1` and `result2`, which meets the requirement of finding the maximum subsequence sum that is odd.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **True**
