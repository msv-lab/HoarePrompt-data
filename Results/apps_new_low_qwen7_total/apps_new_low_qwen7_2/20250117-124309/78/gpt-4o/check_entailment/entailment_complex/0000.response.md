Reasoning:
1. The function correctly initializes variables and reads input as specified.
2. The logic to handle the case where the total sum is odd is straightforward and correct. If the sum is odd, it simply prints the total sum.
3. For the case where the total sum is even, the function correctly identifies the smallest positive odd number (`min_positive_odd`) and the largest negative odd number (`max_negative_odd`). 
4. It then calculates two potential sums: 
   - `result1` as the total sum minus the smallest positive odd number (if any).
   - `result2` as the total sum minus the largest negative odd number (if any).
5. Finally, it prints the maximum of these two values. This approach ensures that the chosen subsequence has an odd sum and is the maximum possible among all such subsequences.
6. The function correctly handles edge cases where there might be no positive or negative odd numbers by using `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')` appropriately.
7. The overall logic aligns with the problem statement and guarantees finding the maximum subsequence sum that is odd.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
