Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of integer numbers of length n. Your task is to find such subsequence that its sum is odd and maximum among all such subsequences. It's guaranteed that given sequence contains subsequence with odd sum.

Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You should write a program which finds sum of the best subsequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^4 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4). The sequence contains at least one subsequence with odd sum.


-----Output-----

Print sum of resulting subseqeuence.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
-2 2 -3 1

Output
3

Input
3
2 -5 -3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example sum of the second and the fourth elements is 3.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n indicating the length of the sequence, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the sequence. It is guaranteed that n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and each a_i satisfies -10^4 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and the sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

total_sum = sum(a)

min_positive_odd = float('inf')

max_negative_odd = float('-inf')
    if (total_sum % 2 != 0) :
        print(total_sum)
    else :
        for num in a:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                if num > 0:
                    min_positive_odd = min(min_positive_odd, num)
                else:
                    max_negative_odd = max(max_negative_odd, num)
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an empty list, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd number in the original list `a` (or positive infinity if no such number exists), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd number in the original list `a` (or negative infinity if no such number exists), and `total_sum` remains even (unchanged).
        result1 = total_sum - min_positive_odd if min_positive_odd != float('inf'
    ) else float('-inf')

result2 = total_sum - max_negative_odd if max_negative_odd != float('-inf'
    ) else float('-inf')

print(max(result1, result2))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is the integer read from the first line, `a` is the list of integers read from the second line, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd number in the list `a` (if any), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd number in the list `a` (if any). If `total_sum` is odd, the function continues with the current state of the variables. If `total_sum` is even, the function sets `a` to an empty list, and `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` remain as positive and negative infinity respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a sequence of `n` integers from the standard input. It calculates the sum of the sequence and checks if the sum is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints the sum. If the sum is even, it finds the smallest positive odd number and the largest negative odd number in the sequence (if they exist). It then computes two values: `result1` as the sum minus the smallest positive odd number (if it exists) and `result2` as the sum minus the largest negative odd number (if it exists). Finally, it prints the maximum of these two values. The function does not return anything explicitly but modifies the global variables `total_sum`, `min_positive_odd`, and `max_negative_odd`. Potential edge cases include sequences with no positive or negative odd numbers, and the function handles these by setting `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` to infinity or negative infinity respectively.
