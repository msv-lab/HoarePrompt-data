Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find the subsequence with the maximum odd sum. The logic in the program does not consider all possible subsequences, but instead relies on the sum of the entire array and the presence of positive and negative odd numbers. This approach does not guarantee finding the maximum odd sum subsequence, especially in cases where the maximum odd sum is achieved by a subset of the array rather than the entire array or a simple combination of positive and negative odd numbers.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
-2 -3 1
```
The program will output `-4` (the sum of the entire array), but the correct output should be `1` (the sum of the third element, which is the only odd number in the array and thus the maximum odd sum subsequence).

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
