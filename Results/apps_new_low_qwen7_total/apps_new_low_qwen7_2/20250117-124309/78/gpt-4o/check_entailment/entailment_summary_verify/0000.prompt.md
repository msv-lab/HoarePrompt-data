You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of integer numbers of length n. Your task is to find such subsequence that its sum is odd and maximum among all such subsequences. It's guaranteed that given sequence contains subsequence with odd sum.

Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You should write a program which finds sum of the best subsequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^4 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4). The sequence contains at least one subsequence with odd sum.


-----Output-----

Print sum of resulting subseqeuence.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
-2 2 -3 1

Output
3

Input
3
2 -5 -3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example sum of the second and the fourth elements is 3.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(a)
    min_positive_odd = float('inf')
    max_negative_odd = float('-inf')
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        print(total_sum)
    else:
        for num in a:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                if num > 0:
                    min_positive_odd = min(min_positive_odd, num)
                else:
                    max_negative_odd = max(max_negative_odd, num)
        result1 = total_sum - min_positive_odd if min_positive_odd != float('inf') else float('-inf')
        result2 = total_sum - max_negative_odd if max_negative_odd != float('-inf') else float('-inf')
        print(max(result1, result2))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a sequence of `n` integers from the standard input. It calculates the sum of the sequence and checks if the sum is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints the sum. If the sum is even, it finds the smallest positive odd number and the largest negative odd number in the sequence (if they exist). It then computes two values: `result1` as the sum minus the smallest positive odd number (if it exists) and `result2` as the sum minus the largest negative odd number (if it exists). Finally, it prints the maximum of these two values. The function does not return anything explicitly but modifies the global variables `total_sum`, `min_positive_odd`, and `max_negative_odd`. Potential edge cases include sequences with no positive or negative odd numbers, and the function handles these by setting `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` to infinity or negative infinity respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find the subsequence with the maximum odd sum. The logic in the program does not consider all possible subsequences, but instead relies on the sum of the entire array and the presence of positive and negative odd numbers. This approach does not guarantee finding the maximum odd sum subsequence, especially in cases where the maximum odd sum is achieved by a subset of the array rather than the entire array or a simple combination of positive and negative odd numbers.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
-2 -3 1
```
The program will output `-4` (the sum of the entire array), but the correct output should be `1` (the sum of the third element, which is the only odd number in the array and thus the maximum odd sum subsequence).

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
