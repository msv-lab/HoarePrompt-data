You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of integer numbers of length n. Your task is to find such subsequence that its sum is odd and maximum among all such subsequences. It's guaranteed that given sequence contains subsequence with odd sum.

Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You should write a program which finds sum of the best subsequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^4 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4). The sequence contains at least one subsequence with odd sum.


-----Output-----

Print sum of resulting subseqeuence.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
-2 2 -3 1

Output
3

Input
3
2 -5 -3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example sum of the second and the fourth elements is 3.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(a)
    min_positive_odd = float('inf')
    max_negative_odd = float('-inf')
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        print(total_sum)
    else:
        for num in a:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                if num > 0:
                    min_positive_odd = min(min_positive_odd, num)
                else:
                    max_negative_odd = max(max_negative_odd, num)
        result1 = total_sum - min_positive_odd if min_positive_odd != float('inf') else float('-inf')
        result2 = total_sum - max_negative_odd if max_negative_odd != float('-inf') else float('-inf')
        print(max(result1, result2))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a sequence of `n` integers from the standard input. It calculates the sum of the sequence and checks if the sum is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints the sum. If the sum is even, it finds the smallest positive odd number and the largest negative odd number in the sequence (if they exist). It then computes two values: `result1` as the sum minus the smallest positive odd number (if it exists) and `result2` as the sum minus the largest negative odd number (if it exists). Finally, it prints the maximum of these two values. The function does not return anything explicitly but modifies the global variables `total_sum`, `min_positive_odd`, and `max_negative_odd`. Potential edge cases include sequences with no positive or negative odd numbers, and the function handles these by setting `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` to infinity or negative infinity respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the sequence `a`.

2. **Total Sum Calculation**:
   - `total_sum = sum(a)` computes the sum of the entire sequence.
   - If `total_sum` is already odd, it prints `total_sum`, which is correct because the entire sequence is a valid subsequence with an odd sum.

3. **Handling Even Total Sum**:
   - If `total_sum` is even, the algorithm tries to find the smallest positive odd number (`min_positive_odd`) and the largest negative odd number (`max_negative_odd`).
   - This is done by iterating through the sequence and updating these variables accordingly.

4. **Calculating Result**:
   - `result1 = total_sum - min_positive_odd` attempts to remove the smallest positive odd number to make the sum odd and maximize the remaining sum.
   - `result2 = total_sum - max_negative_odd` attempts to remove the largest negative odd number to achieve a similar goal.
   - The final result is determined by taking the maximum of `result1` and `result2`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The use of `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')` ensures that `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` are properly initialized.
   - If no positive or negative odd numbers exist, the respective variable remains unchanged, ensuring the correct behavior when computing `result1` and `result2`.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the need to adjust the total sum to make it odd while maximizing the value.
   - The handling of edge cases where there might be no positive or negative odd numbers is appropriate.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution seems to correctly address the problem statement and handle all necessary conditions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and handles all necessary cases appropriately.
