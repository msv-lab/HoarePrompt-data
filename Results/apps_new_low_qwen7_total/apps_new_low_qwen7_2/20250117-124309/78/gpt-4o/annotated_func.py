#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n indicating the length of the sequence, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the sequence. It is guaranteed that n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and each a_i satisfies -10^4 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and the sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

total_sum = sum(a)

min_positive_odd = float('inf')

max_negative_odd = float('-inf')
    if (total_sum % 2 != 0) :
        print(total_sum)
    else :
        for num in a:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                if num > 0:
                    min_positive_odd = min(min_positive_odd, num)
                else:
                    max_negative_odd = max(max_negative_odd, num)
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an empty list, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd number in the original list `a` (or positive infinity if no such number exists), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd number in the original list `a` (or negative infinity if no such number exists), and `total_sum` remains even (unchanged).
        result1 = total_sum - min_positive_odd if min_positive_odd != float('inf'
    ) else float('-inf')

result2 = total_sum - max_negative_odd if max_negative_odd != float('-inf'
    ) else float('-inf')

print(max(result1, result2))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is the integer read from the first line, `a` is the list of integers read from the second line, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd number in the list `a` (if any), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd number in the list `a` (if any). If `total_sum` is odd, the function continues with the current state of the variables. If `total_sum` is even, the function sets `a` to an empty list, and `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` remain as positive and negative infinity respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a sequence of `n` integers from the standard input. It calculates the sum of the sequence and checks if the sum is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints the sum. If the sum is even, it finds the smallest positive odd number and the largest negative odd number in the sequence (if they exist). It then computes two values: `result1` as the sum minus the smallest positive odd number (if it exists) and `result2` as the sum minus the largest negative odd number (if it exists). Finally, it prints the maximum of these two values. The function does not return anything explicitly but modifies the global variables `total_sum`, `min_positive_odd`, and `max_negative_odd`. Potential edge cases include sequences with no positive or negative odd numbers, and the function handles these by setting `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` to infinity or negative infinity respectively.
