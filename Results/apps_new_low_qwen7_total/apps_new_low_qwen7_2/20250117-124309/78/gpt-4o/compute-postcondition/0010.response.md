Postcondition: ***`a` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of the list `a`, and the current value of `num` is an odd number. If `num` is greater than 0, `min_positive_odd` is the minimum of its previous value (if initialized) and `num`. If `num` is less than or equal to 0, `max_negative_odd` is equal to `num`.***
