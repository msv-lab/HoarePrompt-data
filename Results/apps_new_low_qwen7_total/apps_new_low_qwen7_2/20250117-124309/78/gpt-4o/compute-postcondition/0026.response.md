Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a sequence of `n` integers from the standard input. It calculates the sum of the sequence and checks if the sum is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints the sum. If the sum is even, it finds the smallest positive odd number and the largest negative odd number in the sequence (if they exist). It then computes two values: `result1` as the sum minus the smallest positive odd number (if it exists) and `result2` as the sum minus the largest negative odd number (if it exists). Finally, it prints the maximum of these two values. The function does not return anything explicitly but modifies the global variables `total_sum`, `min_positive_odd`, and `max_negative_odd`. Potential edge cases include sequences with no positive or negative odd numbers, and the function handles these by setting `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` to infinity or negative infinity respectively.**
