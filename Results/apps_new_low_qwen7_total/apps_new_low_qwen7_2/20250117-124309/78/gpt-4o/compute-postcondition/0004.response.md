Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables**: The variables present in the for loop head are `num` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

3. **Determine initial conditions**: Before the loop starts, we know:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
   - `min_positive_odd` is positive infinity.
   - `max_negative_odd` is negative infinity.
   - `total_sum` is even.

4. **Loop execution requirement**: For the loop to execute at least once, the list `a` must contain at least one element. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `a`.

5. **Initial values in the loop head**: 
   - The variable `num` will take the value of the first element in the list `a` when the loop starts its first iteration.

Given these points, we can conclude the following:

- The list `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- The variable `num` will be set to the first element of the list `a` during the first iteration.

Thus, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time should be:

State: **`a` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of the list `a`**
