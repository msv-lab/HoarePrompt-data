Postcondition: ***`a` must have at least two elements, `min_positive_odd` retains its previous value, and `max_negative_odd` is at least its previous value. Specifically, `max_negative_odd` could be updated to the value of `num` if `num` is a negative odd number larger than the previous `max_negative_odd`.***
