The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input stream, where the first line contains an integer `n` indicating the length of the sequence, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the sequence. It is guaranteed that `n` satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and each `a_i` satisfies \(-10^4 \leq a_i \leq 10^4\), and the sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether there exists a subsequence with an odd sum. Given the guarantee that such a subsequence always exists, the function returns `True`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads an integer `n` and a sequence of `n` integers from the standard input. It then returns `True` because the sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum.**
