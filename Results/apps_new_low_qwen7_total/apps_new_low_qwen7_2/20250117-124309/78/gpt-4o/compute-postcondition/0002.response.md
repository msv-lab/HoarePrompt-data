The code `print(total_sum)` simply prints the value of `total_sum`, but does not change its value or affect any other variables. Therefore, the value of `total_sum` remains the same as it was in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from the first line, `a` is the list of integers read from the second line, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is positive infinity, `max_negative_odd` is negative infinity, and `total_sum` is odd.**
