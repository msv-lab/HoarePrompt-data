The given code snippet reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, calculates the total sum of the sequence, and initializes two variables `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd`. However, the code does not perform any operations that would change the values of `n` or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values as read from the input.

Let's break down the impact of each line:

1. `n = int(input())`: Reads an integer `n` from the input and stores it in the variable `n`.
2. `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Reads a line of space-separated integers, converts them to integers, and stores them in a list `a`.
3. `total_sum = sum(a)`: Calculates the sum of the elements in the list `a` and stores it in the variable `total_sum`.
4. `min_positive_odd = float('inf')`: Initializes `min_positive_odd` to positive infinity.
5. `max_negative_odd = float('-inf')`: Initializes `max_negative_odd` to negative infinity.

Since the code does not modify `n` or `a` beyond reading them, the final state will include these values along with the calculated `total_sum`.

Given the initial state (input) is two lines:
- The first line contains an integer `n` indicating the length of the sequence.
- The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the sequence.

After executing the code, the final state will be:

Output State: **n is the integer read from the first line, a is the list of integers read from the second line, total_sum is the sum of the elements in the list a, min_positive_odd is positive infinity, max_negative_odd is negative infinity**.
