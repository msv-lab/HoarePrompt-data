Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer read from the first line, `a` is the list of integers read from the second line, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd number in the list `a` (if any), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd number in the list `a` (if any). If `total_sum` is odd, the function continues with the current state of the variables. If `total_sum` is even, the function sets `a` to an empty list, and `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` remain as positive and negative infinity respectively.***
