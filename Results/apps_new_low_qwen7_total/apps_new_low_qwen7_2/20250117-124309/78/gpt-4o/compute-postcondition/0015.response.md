Postcondition: **`a` must have at least one element. If `num` is greater than 0, `min_positive_odd` is the minimum of its previous value and `num`. Otherwise, if `num` is less than or equal to 0, `max_negative_odd` is the maximum of its previous value and `num`, and `num` is the second element of the list `a`.**
