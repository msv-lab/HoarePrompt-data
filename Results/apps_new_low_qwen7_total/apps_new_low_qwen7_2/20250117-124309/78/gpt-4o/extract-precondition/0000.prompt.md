You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of integer numbers of length n. Your task is to find such subsequence that its sum is odd and maximum among all such subsequences. It's guaranteed that given sequence contains subsequence with odd sum.

Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You should write a program which finds sum of the best subsequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^4 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4). The sequence contains at least one subsequence with odd sum.


-----Output-----

Print sum of resulting subseqeuence.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
-2 2 -3 1

Output
3

Input
3
2 -5 -3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example sum of the second and the fourth elements is 3.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
