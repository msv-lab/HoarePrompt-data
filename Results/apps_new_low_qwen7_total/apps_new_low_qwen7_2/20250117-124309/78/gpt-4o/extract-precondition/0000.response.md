Precondition: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n indicating the length of the sequence, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the sequence. It is guaranteed that n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and each a_i satisfies -10^4 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and the sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum.**
