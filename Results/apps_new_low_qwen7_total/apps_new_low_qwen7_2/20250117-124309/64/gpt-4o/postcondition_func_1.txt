The function `lcm` accepts two parameters: a list `a` of non-negative integers and an integer `b`. It calculates and returns the product of the first element in the list `a` and `b`, divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the first element in the list `a` and `b`. If the list `a` is empty or the first element in the list `a` is 0, the function will return 0. If `b` is 0, the function will also return 0, as the gcd of any number and 0 is 0, leading to division by zero. However, the code does not handle the case where `b` is 0 explicitly, which could lead to an error in real-world usage.
