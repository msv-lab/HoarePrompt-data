The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `cards`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `cards` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.

The function first calculates the product of all elements in `cards` and stores it in `total_product`. It then checks if `total_product` is divisible by `k`. If not, it returns 0. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate two lists, `left_product` and `right_product`.

`right_product` is initialized to `[1] * (n + 1)` and is updated in reverse order, such that `right_product[i]` is the product of all elements from `cards[i]` to `cards[n-1]`. `left_product` is initialized to 1 and is updated during the second loop, such that `left_product` becomes the product of all elements in `cards` in reverse order after `n` iterations.

In the second loop, the function counts the number of indices `i` where the product of `left_product` and `right_product[i+1]` is divisible by `k`. It does this by checking the condition `left_product * right_product[i + 1] % k == 0` for each index `i` in the range `range(n)` and incrementing `valid_ways` accordingly.

If the initial check on `total_product` passes, the function returns the count of such indices `i` (stored in `valid_ways`). If `total_product` is not divisible by `k`, the function returns 0.

Edge cases include:
- If `n` is 0, the function should return 0 since `cards` would be an empty list, and `total_product` would be undefined. However, the function handles this case implicitly by ensuring `n` is at least 1.
- If `k` is 1, every `i` will satisfy the divisibility condition, leading to `valid_ways` being equal to `n`.

Missing functionality:
- There is no explicit handling for when `k` is larger than the product of all elements in `cards`. In such cases, `valid_ways` might be unexpectedly high due to underflow or incorrect handling of large numbers. However, the function's logic does not account for this scenario directly.
