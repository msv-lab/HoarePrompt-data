The function `product` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the product of all integers in the list. Given the input constraints (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`), the function calculates the product of these integers. It uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to compute the product, starting with an initial value of 1. This ensures that the multiplication begins correctly without affecting the initial product value. The function handles the case where the list is empty by returning 1, which is the identity element for multiplication.
