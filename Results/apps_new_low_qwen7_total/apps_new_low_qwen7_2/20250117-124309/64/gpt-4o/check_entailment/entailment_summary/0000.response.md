Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ways to choose \(x\) and \(y\) such that the product of the remaining cards is divisible by \(k\).
- The solution provided follows a logical approach:
  1. It first checks if the product of all cards is already divisible by \(k\). If not, there are no valid ways to choose \(x\) and \(y\), and the function returns 0.
  2. If the product of all cards is divisible by \(k\), it calculates the product of the remaining cards from the right (`right_product`), and from the left (`left_product`).
  3. It then iterates through the cards and checks if the product of the left and right parts is divisible by \(k\). If so, it increments the count of valid ways.
- The code handles edge cases appropriately:
  - If the product of all cards is not divisible by \(k\), it correctly returns 0.
  - It implicitly handles the case where the list of cards is empty (though this case is not explicitly checked).
  - For the case where \(k = 1\), every subarray product is divisible by 1, leading to \(n\) valid ways, which is correctly handled.

The additional functions `lcm` and `product` do not seem to be used in the primary function `func_1`, but they are defined. Since the primary function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
