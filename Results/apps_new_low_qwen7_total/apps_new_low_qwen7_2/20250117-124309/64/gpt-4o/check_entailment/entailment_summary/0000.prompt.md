 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vova again tries to play some computer card game.

The rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed. Each card has a number written on it; number a_{i} is written on the i-th card in the deck.

After receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.

Vova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k. So Vova received a deck (possibly not a valid one) and a number k, and now he wonders, how many ways are there to choose x and y so the deck he will get after removing x cards from the top and y cards from the bottom is valid?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the numbers written on the cards.


-----Output-----

Print the number of ways to choose x and y so the resulting deck is valid.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
6 2 8

Output
4

Input
3 6
9 1 14

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the possible values of x and y are:

  x = 0, y = 0;  x = 1, y = 0;  x = 2, y = 0;  x = 0, y = 1.

# Functions with Execution Summary:

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
cards = list(map(int, data[2:]))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k, cards):
    from math import gcd
    from functools import reduce


    total_product = product(cards)
    if total_product % k != 0:
        return 0
    right_product = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
    valid_ways = 0
    left_product = 1
    for x in range(n):
        if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        left_product *= cards[x]
    return valid_ways
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `cards`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `cards` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.

The function first calculates the product of all elements in `cards` and stores it in `total_product`. It then checks if `total_product` is divisible by `k`. If not, it returns 0. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate two lists, `left_product` and `right_product`.

`right_product` is initialized to `[1] * (n + 1)` and is updated in reverse order, such that `right_product[i]` is the product of all elements from `cards[i]` to `cards[n-1]`. `left_product` is initialized to 1 and is updated during the second loop, such that `left_product` becomes the product of all elements in `cards` in reverse order after `n` iterations.

In the second loop, the function counts the number of indices `i` where the product of `left_product` and `right_product[i+1]` is divisible by `k`. It does this by checking the condition `left_product * right_product[i + 1] % k == 0` for each index `i` in the range `range(n)` and incrementing `valid_ways` accordingly.

If the initial check on `total_product` passes, the function returns the count of such indices `i` (stored in `valid_ways`). If `total_product` is not divisible by `k`, the function returns 0.

Edge cases include:
- If `n` is 0, the function should return 0 since `cards` would be an empty list, and `total_product` would be undefined. However, the function handles this case implicitly by ensuring `n` is at least 1.
- If `k` is 1, every `i` will satisfy the divisibility condition, leading to `valid_ways` being equal to `n`.

Missing functionality:
- There is no explicit handling for when `k` is larger than the product of all elements in `cards`. In such cases, `valid_ways` might be unexpectedly high due to underflow or incorrect handling of large numbers. However, the function's logic does not account for this scenario directly.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `lcm` accepts two parameters: a list `a` of non-negative integers and an integer `b`. It calculates and returns the product of the first element in the list `a` and `b`, divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the first element in the list `a` and `b`. If the list `a` is empty or the first element in the list `a` is 0, the function will return 0. If `b` is 0, the function will also return 0, as the gcd of any number and 0 is 0, leading to division by zero. However, the code does not handle the case where `b` is 0 explicitly, which could lead to an error in real-world usage.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def product(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr, 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `product` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the product of all integers in the list. Given the input constraints (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`), the function calculates the product of these integers. It uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to compute the product, starting with an initial value of 1. This ensures that the multiplication begins correctly without affecting the initial product value. The function handles the case where the list is empty by returning 1, which is the identity element for multiplication.
