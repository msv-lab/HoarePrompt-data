### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem, let's break down the solution step-by-step and validate the logic against the problem description.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the necessary functions, including `gcd`, `lcm`, and `product`.
   - These functions are not used in the main logic but are included in the code.

2. **Total Product Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the total product of all the cards in the deck using the `product` function.
   - If the total product is not divisible by `k`, it immediately returns 0. This is correct because if the total product is not divisible by `k`, no valid way exists to split the deck.

3. **Right Product Calculation**:
   - It computes the `right_product` array where `right_product[i]` stores the product of all elements from `cards[i]` to `cards[n-1]`.
   - This helps in calculating the product of the remaining cards after removing `x` cards from the top and `y` cards from the bottom.

4. **Valid Ways Calculation**:
   - It iterates through all possible values of `x` (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - For each `x`, it checks if the product of the cards from `x+1` to `n-y` (where `y` can vary from 0 to `n-x-1`) is divisible by `k`.
   - To do this, it multiplies the `left_product` (which starts as 1 and gets updated as `x` increases) with `right_product[x+1]` and checks divisibility.

5. **Return Valid Ways**:
   - The count of such valid `(x, y)` pairs is returned.

#### Validation Against Problem Description:

- **Correctness of Total Product Check**:
  - The check `if total_product % k != 0: return 0` ensures that if the total product is not divisible by `k`, no valid ways exist, which is correct.

- **Right Product Calculation**:
  - The `right_product` array correctly stores the product of the subarray starting from `cards[i]` to `cards[n-1]`. This is used to calculate the product of the remaining cards after removing `x` cards from the top and `y` cards from the bottom.

- **Valid Ways Calculation**:
  - The logic of iterating through all possible values of `x` and checking if `left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0` is correct. This ensures that the product of the remaining cards is divisible by `k`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases such as when the total product is not divisible by `k` and returns 0 immediately.
  - The logic correctly accounts for all possible values of `x` and `y`.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis and validation, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid ways to choose `x` and `y` such that the product of the remaining cards is divisible by `k`.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
