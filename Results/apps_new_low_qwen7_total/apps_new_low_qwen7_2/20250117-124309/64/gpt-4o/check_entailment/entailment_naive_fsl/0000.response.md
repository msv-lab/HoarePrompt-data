Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of valid ways to choose \(x\) and \(y\) such that the product of the remaining cards is divisible by \(k\). 

The main issue lies in the calculation of `right_product`. In the given implementation, `right_product[i]` is set to `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`, which means `right_product[i]` will contain the product of all cards from position `i` to the end of the array. However, the program does not correctly update the `right_product` for each position when checking the condition `if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0`.

To fix this, `right_product` should be calculated in a way that it holds the product of elements from position `x + 1` to the end of the array. Additionally, the logic for updating `valid_ways` should ensure that the condition checks the product of the remaining cards correctly.

A corrected version of the code would involve maintaining the `right_product` array properly and ensuring that the condition checks are accurate. Here is a simplified version of how it could be corrected:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def func_1(n, k, cards):
    total_product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, cards, 1)
    if total_product % k != 0:
        return 0
    
    right_product = 1
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        right_product *= cards[i]
        right_product //= gcd(right_product, k)
    
    valid_ways = 0
    left_product = 1
    for x in range(n):
        if left_product * right_product % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        left_product *= cards[x]
        if x < n-1:
            right_product //= cards[x+1]
            right_product *= gcd(right_product, k)
    
    return valid_ways

# Function 2 (not used in the solution)
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# Function 3 (not used in the solution)
def product(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr, 1)
```

This corrected version ensures that `right_product` is updated correctly for each position, and the condition checks the product of the remaining cards accurately.
