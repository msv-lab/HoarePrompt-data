Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the problem.

1. **Reading Input and Function Call**:
   - The input reading and function call logic is handled correctly. The `sys.stdin.read` method reads all the input, and the split and conversion to integers are done properly.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the correct parameters after processing the input.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initial Checks**:
     - The initial check if `total_product % k != 0` returns 0 if the total product of the deck is not divisible by `k`. This handles the trivial case where no valid decks can be formed.
   - **Calculating `right_product`**:
     - A list `right_product` is initialized with length `n + 1` filled with 1s. It is then filled by iterating from `n-1` to 0, calculating the product of the remaining cards from each position.
     - This step correctly calculates the right product for each position, ensuring that `right_product[i]` represents the product of all cards from index `i` to `n-1`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - **Variables Initialization**:
     - `valid_ways` is initialized to 0.
     - `left_product` is initialized to 1.
   - **Iterate Over Possible Values of `x`**:
     - For each possible value of `x` (from 0 to `n-1`), the code checks if the product of the remaining part of the deck (from `x+1` to `n-y`) is divisible by `k`.
     - The condition `if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0` is checked. If true, it increments `valid_ways`.
     - `left_product` is updated by multiplying it with `cards[x]` in each iteration.
   - **Final Return**:
     - The function returns the count of valid `(x, y)` pairs.

Given the detailed analysis, the code correctly follows the logic required to solve the problem. It handles edge cases and computes the result accurately by maintaining the products of relevant parts of the deck.

Correctness: **True**
