Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the total product of all cards and checks if it is divisible by `k`. If not, it returns 0 immediately, which is correct.
   - It then computes the `right_product` list, which represents the product of elements from the end of the `cards` list towards the beginning.
   - In the next loop, it iterates through the `cards` list to calculate the `left_product` and checks if the product of `left_product` and the corresponding `right_product` is divisible by `k`. If so, it increments the `valid_ways` counter.
   - The logic ensures that the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` is counted correctly by considering all possible combinations of removing cards from the top and bottom.

2. **Function `lcm`**:
   - The function is defined but never called in the main program. Its purpose is to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using their greatest common divisor (GCD). However, this function is not used in the main logic and does not affect the correctness of the program.
   
3. **Function `product`**:
   - This function calculates the product of all elements in a list. While it is used in `func_1` to calculate the `total_product`, the logic in `func_1` correctly handles the product calculation and does not rely on the `product` function's implementation.

Given that all the functions work as intended and collectively meet the problem requirements, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
