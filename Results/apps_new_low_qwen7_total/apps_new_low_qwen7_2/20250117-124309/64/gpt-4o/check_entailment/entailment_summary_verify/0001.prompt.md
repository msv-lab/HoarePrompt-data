You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vova again tries to play some computer card game.

The rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed. Each card has a number written on it; number a_{i} is written on the i-th card in the deck.

After receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.

Vova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k. So Vova received a deck (possibly not a valid one) and a number k, and now he wonders, how many ways are there to choose x and y so the deck he will get after removing x cards from the top and y cards from the bottom is valid?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the numbers written on the cards.


-----Output-----

Print the number of ways to choose x and y so the resulting deck is valid.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
6 2 8

Output
4

Input
3 6
9 1 14

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the possible values of x and y are:

  x = 0, y = 0;  x = 1, y = 0;  x = 2, y = 0;  x = 0, y = 1.

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, cards):
    from math import gcd
    from functools import reduce


    total_product = product(cards)
    if total_product % k != 0:
        return 0
    right_product = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
    valid_ways = 0
    left_product = 1
    for x in range(n):
        if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        left_product *= cards[x]
    return valid_ways

#Function 2:
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

#Function 3:
def product(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr, 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `product` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the product of all integers in the list. Given the input constraints (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`), the function calculates the product of these integers. It uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to compute the product, starting with an initial value of 1. This ensures that the multiplication begins correctly without affecting the initial product value. The function handles the case where the list is empty by returning 1, which is the identity element for multiplication.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem, let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the necessary functions, including `gcd`, `lcm`, and `product`.

2. **Total Product Calculation**: It calculates the total product of all the cards in the deck using the `product` function. If this total product is not divisible by `k`, no matter how we slice the deck, it will never be valid, hence returning 0 immediately.

3. **Right Product Calculation**: It computes the right product array where `right_product[i]` stores the product of all elements from `cards[i]` to `cards[n-1]`. This helps in calculating the product of the remaining cards after removing `x` cards from the top and `y` cards from the bottom.

4. **Valid Ways Calculation**: 
   - It iterates through all possible values of `x` (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - For each `x`, it checks if the product of the cards from `x+1` to `n-y` (where `y` can vary from 0 to `n-x-1`) is divisible by `k`.
   - To do this, it multiplies the `left_product` (which starts as 1 and gets updated as `x` increases) with `right_product[x+1]` and checks divisibility.

5. **Return Valid Ways**: The count of such valid `(x, y)` pairs is returned.

Given the structure and the logic, the program appears to correctly calculate the number of ways to choose `x` and `y` such that the product of the remaining cards is divisible by `k`.
