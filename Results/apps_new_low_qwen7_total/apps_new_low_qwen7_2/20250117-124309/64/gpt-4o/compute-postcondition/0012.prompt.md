You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet consisting of multiple lines. Your task is to execute all the lines in sequence and provide the output state after the entire code block has been run. Avoid describing how the program runs step-by-step for individual lines but instead focus on the combined effect of all lines. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations.  

Include all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution and update the values of any variables that are modified by the code. Provide the final state in the text format: Output State: **output state**.

Here are some examples to help you understand the task:

Example 1:
Initial State: `a` is 5, `b` is 3
```
c = a + b
d = c * 2
```

Example Answer 1:
The first line assigns the value of `a + b` to `c`. Since `a` is 5 and `b` is 3, `c` becomes 8. The second line assigns the value of `c * 2` to `d`, making `d` equal to 16. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **a is 5, b is 3, c is 8, d is 16**

Example 2:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer
```
n= int(input())
x += n
```

Example Answer 2:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line increments `x` by the value of `n`. The value of `x` is a positive integer, and `n` is an integer. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to its original value plus n , n is an integer**

Example 3:
Initial State: `n` is 3, `total` is 1
```
total += n
pass
n= max(total, n)
```

Example Answer 3:
The first line increments `total` by the value of `n`, making `total` equal to 4. The second line does not affect any variables. The third line assigns the maximum value between `total` and `n` to `n`. Since `total` is 4, and n was 3, `n` becomes 4.
Output State: **n is 4, total is 4**

Your Task:
Initial State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all `i`, `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`, `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is `cards[n-1]` and the rest are 1, `i` is equal to `-1`, and `right_product[i]` is equal to 1.

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`. For each iteration, it updates `right_product[i]` to be the product of `right_product[i+1]` and `cards[i]`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
   - `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.
   - `right_product[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `right_product[i+1]` and `cards[i]`. Initially, `right_product` is set to `[cards[n-1], 1, 1, ..., 1]` (length `n+1`), with the last element being 1.
   - `total_product` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.
   - `cards` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: After `n` iterations, `i` will reach -1, and `right_product[i]` will be 1 because it multiplies `cards[0]` through `cards[n-1]` in reverse order. Thus, `right_product` will have been completely updated, starting from `cards[n-1]` down to 1.

4. **Verify Relationships**: The loop ensures that each element in `right_product` is correctly calculated as the product of `cards[i]` and all subsequent elements in `cards`. Since the loop runs exactly `n` times, and `i` starts from `n-1` and decrements to -1, the final state is consistent with the behavior described above.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations is as described.
```
valid_ways = 0
left_product = 1

```

Now, please analyze the entire block of code and provide the final output state. List the impact of all lines on the program, check the previous values of affected variables, and calculate the results. Use the text format: Output State: **output state**. Be as specific as possible, combining changes from all lines into a single coherent final state. Include all valid information from the precondition and update only what is modified by the code.
