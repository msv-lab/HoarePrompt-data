Postcondition: ***`valid_ways` is the count of indices `i` where `left_product * right_product[i+1] <= k`. If `left_product * right_product[x + 1]` is divisible by `k`, `valid_ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` remains `0`, `left_product` is the product of all elements in `cards` in reverse order, `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element `right_product[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the product of all elements in `cards` from index `i` to `n-1` (inclusive), and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.***
