The code updates `right_product[i]` to be the product of `right_product[i + 1]` and `cards[i]`. Given that `right_product[i + 1]` is initially set to 1 (since it is initialized to be a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is `cards[n-1]` and the rest are 1) and `i` is `n-2`, `right_product[i]` is updated to `1 * cards[n-2]`, which is simply `cards[n-2]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all `i`, `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`, `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is `cards[n-1]` and the rest are 1, `i` is now equal to `n-2`, `right_product[i]` is equal to `cards[n-2]`.**
