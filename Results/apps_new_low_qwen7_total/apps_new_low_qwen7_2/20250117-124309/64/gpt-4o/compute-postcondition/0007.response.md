Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\)
   - `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all `i`
   - `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`
   - `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is `cards[n-1]` and the rest are 1
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
   ```
   The loop starts from `i = n-1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` becomes -1.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` will be decreased by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - Initially, `i` is `n-1`.
   - After one iteration, `i` will become `n-2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `k` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `cards` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `total_product` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `right_product` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` decreases by 1, so it becomes `n-2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all `i`, `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`, `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is `cards[n-1]` and the rest are 1, `i` is equal to `n-2`**
