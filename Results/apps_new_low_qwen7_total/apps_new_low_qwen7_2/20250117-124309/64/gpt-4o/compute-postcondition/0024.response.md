Postcondition: **`valid_ways` is the count of indices `i` where `left_product * right_product[i+1] <= k`, `left_product` is `left_product * cards[0] * cards[1]`, `right_product` remains unchanged, `x` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0`, then `valid_ways` is incremented by 1.**
