Postcondition: **`valid_ways` is the count of indices `i` where `left_product * right_product[i+1] <= k`, `left_product` is the product of all elements in `cards` in reverse order, `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element `right_product[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the product of all elements in `cards` from index `i` to `n-1` (inclusive), `x` is `0`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `left_product * right_product[x + 1]` is divisible by `k`**
