Output State: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all `i`, `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`, `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is `cards[n-1]` and the rest are 1, `i` is equal to `-1`, and `right_product[i]` is equal to 1.

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`. For each iteration, it updates `right_product[i]` to be the product of `right_product[i+1]` and `cards[i]`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
   - `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.
   - `right_product[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `right_product[i+1]` and `cards[i]`. Initially, `right_product` is set to `[cards[n-1], 1, 1, ..., 1]` (length `n+1`), with the last element being 1.
   - `total_product` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.
   - `cards` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: After `n` iterations, `i` will reach -1, and `right_product[i]` will be 1 because it multiplies `cards[0]` through `cards[n-1]` in reverse order. Thus, `right_product` will have been completely updated, starting from `cards[n-1]` down to 1.

4. **Verify Relationships**: The loop ensures that each element in `right_product` is correctly calculated as the product of `cards[i]` and all subsequent elements in `cards`. Since the loop runs exactly `n` times, and `i` starts from `n-1` and decrements to -1, the final state is consistent with the behavior described above.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations is as described.
