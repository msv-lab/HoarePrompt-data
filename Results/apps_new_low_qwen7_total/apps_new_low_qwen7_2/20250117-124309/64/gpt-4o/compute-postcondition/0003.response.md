Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\); `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all `i`; `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`. The total product of `cards` is divisible by `k`.**
