Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all `i`, `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`, `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is `cards[n-1]` and the rest are 1, `i` is equal to `-1`, and `right_product[i]` is equal to 1.

Code Block:
```python
valid_ways = 0
left_product = 1
for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
    valid_ways += left_product * right_product[i+1] <= k
    left_product *= cards[i]
    right_product[i] = right_product[i+1] * cards[i]
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `valid_ways` is initialized to 0.
   - `left_product` is initialized to 1.
   - The loop runs from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` in the range, `valid_ways` is incremented if the condition `left_product * right_product[i+1] <= k` is true.
   - `left_product` is updated by multiplying it with `cards[i]`.
   - `right_product[i]` is updated by setting it to `right_product[i+1] * cards[i]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `valid_ways` will contain the number of indices `i` such that `left_product * right_product[i+1] <= k`.
   - `left_product` will be the product of all elements in `cards` in reverse order.
   - `right_product` will be updated such that `right_product[i]` is the product of all elements in `cards` from index `i` to `n-1` (inclusive).

### Calculation:

- **`valid_ways`**: This will be the count of indices `i` where the product of `left_product` up to `i` and the product of `right_product` from `i+1` to `n-1` is less than or equal to `k`.
- **`left_product`**: This will be the product of all elements in `cards` in reverse order.
- **`right_product`**: This will be updated such that `right_product[i]` is the product of all elements in `cards` from index `i` to `n-1` (inclusive).

Since the exact values of `cards`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute specific numerical values for `valid_ways`, `left_product`, and `right_product`. However, we can describe the final state in terms of the operations performed.

### Final Output State:
- `valid_ways` is the count of indices `i` where `left_product * right_product[i+1] <= k`.
- `left_product` is the product of all elements in `cards` in reverse order.
- `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element `right_product[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the product of all elements in `cards` from index `i` to `n-1` (inclusive).

Output State: **valid_ways is the count of indices i where left_product * right_product[i+1] <= k, left_product is the product of all elements in cards in reverse order, right_product is a list of n + 1 elements where each element right_product[i] (for i from 0 to n-1) is the product of all elements in cards from index i to n-1 (inclusive)**.
