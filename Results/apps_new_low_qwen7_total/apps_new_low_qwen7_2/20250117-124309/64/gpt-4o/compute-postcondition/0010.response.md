The code updates the value of `right_product[i]` by multiplying `right_product[i + 1]` (which is `cards[n-3]`) with `cards[i]`. Given that `i` is `n-3`, the previous value of `right_product[i]` was `cards[n-3]`.

Let's denote `cards[n-3]` as `c`. Therefore, the updated value of `right_product[i]` is `cards[n-3] * cards[i]`, which is `c * cards[i]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all `i`, `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`, `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is `cards[n-1]` and the rest are 1, `i` is now equal to `n-3`, `right_product[i]` is equal to `c * cards[i]` where `c` is `cards[n-3]`**.
