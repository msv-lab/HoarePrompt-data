Postcondition: **`valid_ways` is the count of indices `i` where `left_product * right_product[i+1] <= k`. If `left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0`, `valid_ways` is incremented by 1. `left_product` is now `left_product * cards[0]`; `x` is 1; `right_product` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**
