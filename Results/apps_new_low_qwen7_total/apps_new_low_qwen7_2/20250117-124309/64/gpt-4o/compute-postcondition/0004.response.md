The code initializes a list `right_product` with `n + 1` elements, each set to 1. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `cards`, or `total_product`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\); `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all `i`; `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`; `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements, each set to 1. The total product of `cards` is divisible by `k`.**
