Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used to iterate over the indices of the list `cards` in reverse order.
   - The initial value of `i` is `n-1`, and the loop decrements `i` by 1 until `i` reaches -1.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions for the Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the valid range. Specifically, `i` should start at `n-1` and decrease to 0 (since the loop continues as long as `i` is non-negative).

3. **Check the State of Each Variable:**
   - `n`: Since `i` starts at `n-1`, `n` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `k`: This variable is not directly involved in the loop execution but is a given condition that the total product of `cards` is divisible by `k`.
   - `cards`: This is a list of `n` positive integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^9\). The state of this list does not change during the loop.
   - `total_product`: This is the product of all elements in `cards` and is initially computed outside the loop.
   - `right_product`: This is a list of `n + 1` elements, each initialized to 1. During the loop, `right_product[i]` will store the product of all elements in `cards` from index `i` to the end of the list.

4. **Determine the State Required for the First Iteration:**
   - For the first iteration of the loop, `i` should start at `n-1`, which means `i` must be equal to `n-1`.

Therefore, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all `i`, `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`, `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements, each set to 1, and `i` is equal to `n-1`.**
