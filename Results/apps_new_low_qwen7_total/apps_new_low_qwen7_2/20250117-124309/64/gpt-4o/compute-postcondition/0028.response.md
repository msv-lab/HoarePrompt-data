The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `cards`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `cards` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.

The function returns either 0 or the count of indices `i` where `left_product * right_product[i+1] % k == 0`, where `left_product` is the product of all elements in `cards` in reverse order, and `x` is `n-1`, with `n` being greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `cards`, and return 0 or the count of specific indices based on the given conditions.
