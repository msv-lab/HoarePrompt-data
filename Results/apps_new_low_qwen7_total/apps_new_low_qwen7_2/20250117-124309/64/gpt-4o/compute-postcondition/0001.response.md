The function `product` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The list `arr` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), and another parameter `k`, which is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\). However, since `k` does not appear to be used within the described output, it seems to be a redundant parameter. Based on the provided information, the function should only consider the list `arr`.

The function returns the product of all integers in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `product` is to accept a list `arr` of integers and return the product of all integers in the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the product of all integers in the list.**
