Postcondition: ***`distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` remain unchanged. If `fuel < distance_after_fuel_station`, then `fuel` is reduced by `a - f` or `f` and then by `distance_to_fuel_station`, `current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and the number of refuels (`refuels`) is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `fuel` is reduced by `distance_to_fuel_station`, `current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)`, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`.***
