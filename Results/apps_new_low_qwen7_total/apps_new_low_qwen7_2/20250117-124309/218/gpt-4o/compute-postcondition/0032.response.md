Output State: **distance_to_travel remains unchanged, distance_to_fuel_station remains unchanged, distance_after_fuel_station remains unchanged, fuel is b, current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a), i is i_prev + 1, refuels += 1**

Explanation:
- The first line `refuels += 1` increments the number of refuels by 1.
- The second line `fuel = b` sets the value of `fuel` to `b`.
- The lines `current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)` and `i` is `i_prev + 1` do not get executed because they are commented out (indicated by `pass`). Therefore, these lines do not change the values of `current_position` or `i`.

Since the lines that modify the variables are executed, we update `refuels` and `fuel`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
