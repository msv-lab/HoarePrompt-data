Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the effects of the lines on the variables:

Initial State: `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, `distance_after_fuel_station`, `fuel`, `current_position`, `i`, `i_prev` are all defined, with `fuel < distance_after_fuel_station`.

Code Snippet:
```
fuel -= distance_after_fuel_station
current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Line: `fuel -= distance_after_fuel_station`**
   - This line subtracts `distance_after_fuel_station` from the current value of `fuel`.
   - After this operation, `fuel` will be reduced by `distance_after_fuel_station`.

2. **Second Line: `current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)`**
   - This line updates `current_position` by adding `distance_to_travel` to it and then taking modulo `2 * a`.
   - `current_position` will be updated based on the new value of `current_position` after the addition.

### Final State:
- `fuel` is decreased by `distance_after_fuel_station`.
- `current_position` is updated according to the formula `(current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)`.
- `i` is not mentioned to be updated in the given code snippet, so it remains `i_prev + 1`.
- `refuels` is not mentioned to be updated in the given code snippet, so it remains unchanged.

Since the code snippet does not explicitly mention updating `i` or `refuels`, we assume they are not affected by the given lines. 

### Output State:
Output State: **fuel is fuel - distance_after_fuel_station, current_position is (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a), i is i_prev + 1**
