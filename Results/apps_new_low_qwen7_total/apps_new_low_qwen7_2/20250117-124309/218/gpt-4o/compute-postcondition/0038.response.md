Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k`, where `0 < f < a ≤ 10^6`, `1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4`. It simulates a vehicle traveling back and forth between two points, each `a` units apart, for `k` trips. During each trip, the vehicle needs to refuel at specific distances defined by `f`. If the fuel is insufficient to reach the next refueling point, the vehicle refuels fully from `b` units of fuel before continuing. The function calculates and prints the total number of refuels required for the entire journey. The function also handles the case where the initial fuel is insufficient to reach the first refueling point, in which case it prints `-1` and exits.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If the initial fuel `b` is exactly equal to the distance to the first refueling station `distance_to_fuel_station`, it is considered that the vehicle can just reach the refueling station without needing to refill. However, the code checks if `fuel < distance_to_fuel_station` and exits if true, which means it will not count this scenario as a refuel. This edge case should be noted.
- The function correctly handles the scenario where the fuel is insufficient to reach the refueling point and refuels fully, but it does not account for the possibility of the vehicle reaching the end of its journey without needing to refuel again after the last refueling. If `fuel >= distance_after_fuel_station` after the last trip, no additional refuel is needed, which is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations.
