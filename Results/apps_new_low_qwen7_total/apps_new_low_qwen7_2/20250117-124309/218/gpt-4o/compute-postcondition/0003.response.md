Output State: **i is 0, k must be greater than 0, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is f, distance_after_fuel_station is a - f**

Explanation:
- The first line `distance_to_travel = a` assigns the value of `a` to `distance_to_travel`.
- The second line `distance_to_fuel_station = f` assigns the value of `f` to `distance_to_fuel_station`.
- The third line `distance_after_fuel_station = a - f` calculates the difference between `a` and `f` and assigns it to `distance_after_fuel_station`.

All other variables (`i` and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states. `i` stays at 0, and `k` still must be greater than 0.
