The function `func` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k`. The constraints are as follows:
- `a` and `b` are integers such that \(0 < f < a \leq 10^6\),
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\),
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^4\).

The output of the function depends on the values of these parameters, but the specific output is not detailed in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k`, where `a` and `b` are integers such that \(0 < f < a \leq 10^6\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^4\).**
