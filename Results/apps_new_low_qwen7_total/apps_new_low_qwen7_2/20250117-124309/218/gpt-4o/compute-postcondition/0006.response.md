Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `f` or `a - f`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f` or `a - f` based on the value of `i`. If `i % 2 == 0`, then `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f` and `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f`. Otherwise, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f` and `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f`.**
