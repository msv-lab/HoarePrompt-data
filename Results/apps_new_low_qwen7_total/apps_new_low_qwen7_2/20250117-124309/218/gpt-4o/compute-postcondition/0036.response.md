The code `print(refuels)` simply prints the value of `refuels` but does not change any variable's value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `current_position` is `((current_position + (k * a)) % (2 * a))`, `refuels` is the number of times fuel was less than distance_after_fuel_station and fuel was replenished, `fuel` is the remaining fuel after all iterations.**
