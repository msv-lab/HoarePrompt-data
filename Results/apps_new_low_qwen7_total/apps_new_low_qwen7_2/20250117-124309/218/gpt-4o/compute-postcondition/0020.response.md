Postcondition: ***`distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` remain their original values regardless of the value of `fuel`.***

Explanation:
- The if part states that if `fuel` is less than `distance_to_fuel_station`, then the distances (`distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station`) remain unchanged.
- Since there is no else part, the distances will remain unchanged in any case, whether the condition in the if statement is true or false. Thus, the overall postcondition is that all distances retain their original values.
