Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial States:
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `f` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `refuels` is 0.
- `fuel` is an input integer.
- `total_distance` is \(2 \times \text{input_integer} \times \text{input_integer}\).

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop iterator `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration. For the first iteration of the loop, `i` should be 0.
2. **Variable `k`**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `k`. Therefore, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop executes the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `i` must be 0.
- `k` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
