The given code block consists of two lines:

1. `print(-1)`
2. `exit()`

Let's analyze the impact of these lines on the program and the initial state.

### Line 1: `print(-1)`
This line prints `-1` to the console. However, this operation does not modify any variables or change the initial state in terms of the distances (`distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, `distance_after_fuel_station`).

### Line 2: `exit()`
This line terminates the program immediately, without executing any further code. As a result, no additional assignments or operations can occur.

Since the program is terminated before any changes can affect the initial distances, the final state remains the same as the initial state.

### Final Output State
Output State: **distance_to_travel is its original value, distance_to_fuel_station is its original value, distance_after_fuel_station is its original value**

This means that the distances remain unchanged from their initial values specified in the precondition.
