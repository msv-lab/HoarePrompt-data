The initial state provides that `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` are integers with the constraints 0 < `f` < `a` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^4. The given code block reads four integers from the input, assigning them to `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` respectively. It also initializes `refuels` to 0, `fuel` to the value of `b`, and calculates `total_distance` as `2 * a * k`.

Since the actual input values are not provided, we can represent the updated states symbolically based on the input values. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. `a, b, f, k = map(int, input().split())`: This line reads four integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k`.
2. `refuels = 0`: This initializes `refuels` to 0.
3. `fuel = b`: This sets the variable `fuel` to the value of `b`.
4. `total_distance = 2 * a * k`: This calculates `total_distance` as twice the product of `a` and `k`.

Given these operations, the final state includes the input values assigned to `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k`, `refuels` set to 0, `fuel` set to `b`, and `total_distance` calculated as `2 * a * k`.

Output State: **a is input integer, b is input integer, f is input integer, k is input integer, refuels is 0, fuel is input integer, total_distance is 2 * input_integer * input_integer**
