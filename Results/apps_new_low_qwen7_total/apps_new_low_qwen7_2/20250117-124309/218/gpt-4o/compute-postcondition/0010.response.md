The code subtracts the value of `distance_to_fuel_station` from `fuel`. Given the initial conditions, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f`. Therefore, `fuel` will be updated to `fuel - (a - f)`, which simplifies to `fuel - a + f`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f`, `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f`, `fuel` is less than `a - f`, and `fuel` is now `fuel - a + f`.**
