Output State: **distance_to_travel remains unchanged, distance_to_fuel_station remains unchanged, distance_after_fuel_station remains unchanged, fuel is reduced by distance_after_fuel_station, current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)**

Explanation:
- The first line reduces the `fuel` by the value of `distance_after_fuel_station`.
- The second line updates the `current_position` using the formula `(current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)`, which means it calculates the new position by adding `distance_to_travel` to the current position and then taking the modulo with `2 * a` to wrap around if necessary. This line does not affect other variables except `current_position`.
