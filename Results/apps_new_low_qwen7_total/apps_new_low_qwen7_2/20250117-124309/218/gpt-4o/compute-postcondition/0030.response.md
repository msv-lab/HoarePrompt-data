Postcondition: ***`distance_to_travel` remains unchanged, `distance_to_fuel_station` remains unchanged, `distance_after_fuel_station` remains unchanged, `fuel` is reduced by either `a - f` or `f` depending on whether `i` is even, `current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`. If `fuel < distance_to_fuel_station`, the condition remains as is.***
