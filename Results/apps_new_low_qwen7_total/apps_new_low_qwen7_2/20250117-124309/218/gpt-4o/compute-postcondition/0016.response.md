Output State: **distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is f, distance_after_fuel_station is a - f** 

Explanation: The code simply assigns values to three variables based on the given preconditions. The first line assigns the value of `a` to `distance_to_travel`. The second line assigns the value of `f` to `distance_to_fuel_station`. The third line calculates the difference between `a` and `f` and assigns it to `distance_after_fuel_station`. No other variables are affected.
