Output State: **distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is f**

Explanation:
- The first line initializes `distance_to_travel` to the value of `a`.
- The second line calculates `distance_to_fuel_station` as `a - f`.
- The third line sets `distance_after_fuel_station` to the value of `f`.

These assignments do not depend on user input or any external conditions, so the values of `a` and `f` remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the values of all three variables as defined in the initial state and the code execution.
