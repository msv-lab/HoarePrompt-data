Output State: **i is 0, k is greater than 0, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is f, fuel is less than a - f**

Explanation:
The code block consists of two lines:
1. `print(-1)`: This line prints `-1` to the console.
2. `exit()`: This line terminates the program execution immediately.

Since `exit()` is called, no further code execution occurs, and the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state includes all the variables from the initial state without any modifications.
