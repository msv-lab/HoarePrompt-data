The initial state is defined as follows:
- `i` is 0
- `k` is greater than 0
- `distance_to_travel` is `a`
- `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f`
- `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f`
- `fuel` is less than `a - f`
- `fuel` is now `fuel - a + f` (implying `fuel` is less than `f`)

The provided code snippet is:
```
refuels += 1
fuel = b
```

Let's analyze the impact of these lines:

1. The first line `refuels += 1` increments the value of `refuels` by 1. Since `refuels` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is initialized to 0 before this code block. After executing this line, `refuels` becomes 1.

2. The second line `fuel = b` assigns the value of `b` to `fuel`. The value of `b` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact numerical value. However, we know that `fuel` was previously less than `a - f` and is now being set to `b`.

Given these updates, the final state is:
- `i` is 0 (unchanged)
- `k` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `distance_to_travel` is `a` (unchanged)
- `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f` (unchanged)
- `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f` (unchanged)
- `fuel` is `b` (new value, where `b` is some value that was previously not specified but is now the new value for `fuel`)
- `refuels` is 1 (new value)

Output State: **i is 0, k is greater than 0, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is f, fuel is b, refuels is 1**
