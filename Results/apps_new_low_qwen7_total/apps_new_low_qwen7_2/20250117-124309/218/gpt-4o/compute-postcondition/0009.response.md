Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f`, `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f`, and `fuel` is less than `a - f`. After executing the if-else block, if the fuel is less than `a - f`, the function does not make any further changes to the variables.**
