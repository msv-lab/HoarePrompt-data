Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is defined by `i in range(k)`. This means `i` and `k` are the variables involved.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is greater than 0.
   - `distance_to_travel` is `a`.
   - `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f`.
   - `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f`.
   - `fuel` is `b - f` if `b >= f` else `b`.
   - `current_position` is `a`.
   - `refuels` is 1.

3. **Determine Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.

4. **Update the States:**
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `k` remains the same as it is an external value that doesn't change within the loop.
   - `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, `distance_after_fuel_station`, `fuel`, `current_position`, and `refuels` do not change based on the loop head alone; these values would typically be updated inside the loop body, but since they are not specified here, we keep them as they are.

5. **Construct the New State:**
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `k` remains greater than 0.
   - Other variables (`distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, `distance_after_fuel_station`, `fuel`, `current_position`, and `refuels`) remain unchanged as no specific changes are mentioned for the loop head.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f`, `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f`, `fuel` is `b - f` if `b >= f` else `b`, `current_position` is `a`, `refuels` is 1**
