Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f`, `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f`, `fuel` is `b`, and `refuels` is 1. If `fuel` is less than `distance_after_fuel_station`, then `fuel` is set to `b` (the initial fuel level before traveling). Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.**
