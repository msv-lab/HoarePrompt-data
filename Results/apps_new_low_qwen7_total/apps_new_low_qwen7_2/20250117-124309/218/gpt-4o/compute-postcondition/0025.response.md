Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `distance_to_travel` remains unchanged
  - `distance_to_fuel_station` remains unchanged
  - `distance_after_fuel_station` remains unchanged
  - `fuel` is reduced by `distance_after_fuel_station`
  - `current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)`

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```
  for i in range(k):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop condition `i < k` determines whether the loop continues.
- We need to determine the state of the variables at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Increment the Loop Counter `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's call it `i_prev`.
   - After the loop increments `i`, the new value of `i` becomes `i_prev + 1`.

2. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue if `i_prev + 1 < k`.
   - Therefore, `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i_prev + 1`.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` remain unchanged.
   - `fuel` is reduced by `distance_after_fuel_station` after the loop, but not within the loop itself.
   - `current_position` is updated based on `distance_to_travel` and modulo operation, but not directly affected by the loop counter `i`.

### Conclusion
- The only variable that changes at the start of the next iteration is `i`, which becomes `i_prev + 1`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

### Final Answer
State: **`distance_to_travel` remains unchanged, `distance_to_fuel_station` remains unchanged, `distance_after_fuel_station` remains unchanged, `fuel` is reduced by `distance_after_fuel_station`, `current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**

Note: Since `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can replace it with the actual value from the previous iteration if needed. However, without knowing the exact value, we denote it as `i_prev + 1`.
