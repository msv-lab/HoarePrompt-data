Postcondition: ***distance\_to\_travel, distance\_to\_fuel\_station, and distance\_after\_fuel\_station are distances. If the index `i` is even, the distance to travel remains `a`, the distance to the fuel station is `f`, and the distance after the fuel station is `a - f`. If `i` is odd, the distance to travel remains `a`, the distance to the fuel station is `a - f`, and the distance after the fuel station is `f`.***
