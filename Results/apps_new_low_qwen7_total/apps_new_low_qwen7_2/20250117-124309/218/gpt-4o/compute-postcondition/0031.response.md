`fuel` is reduced by `distance_to_fuel_station`. The previous value of `fuel` was reduced by either `a - f` or `f` depending on whether `i` is even, and now it is further reduced by `distance_to_fuel_station`. The current position calculation and the increment of `i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`distance_to_travel` remains unchanged, `distance_to_fuel_station` remains unchanged, `distance_after_fuel_station` remains unchanged, `fuel` is reduced by `a - f` or `f` and then by `distance_to_fuel_station`, `current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`. If `fuel < distance_to_fuel_station`, the condition remains as is.**
