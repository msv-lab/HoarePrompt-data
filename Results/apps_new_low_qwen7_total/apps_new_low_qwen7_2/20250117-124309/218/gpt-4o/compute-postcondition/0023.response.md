Postcondition: ***`distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` remain their original values. Fuel is reduced by `distance_to_fuel_station`. If `fuel < distance_after_fuel_station`, `refuels` is incremented by 1 and `fuel` is set to `b`. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.***
