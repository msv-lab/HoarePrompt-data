`fuel` is decreased by `distance_to_fuel_station`. The original values of `distance_to_travel` and `distance_after_fuel_station` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `distance_to_travel` remains its original value, `distance_to_fuel_station` remains its original value, `distance_after_fuel_station` remains its original value, and `fuel` is reduced by `distance_to_fuel_station`.

Output State: **`distance_to_travel` remains its original value, `distance_to_fuel_station` remains its original value, `distance_after_fuel_station` remains its original value, `fuel` is reduced by `distance_to_fuel_station`**
