The provided code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `print(-1)`
2. `exit()`

These lines are executed sequentially. The first line prints `-1` to the console, and the second line terminates the program execution immediately. After these lines are executed, no further operations are performed on any variables, and the program ends.

Given the initial state:
- `distance_to_travel` remains unchanged
- `distance_to_fuel_station` remains unchanged
- `distance_after_fuel_station` remains unchanged
- `fuel` is reduced by either `a - f` or `f` depending on whether `i` is even
- `current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)`
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`

Since the program exits after printing `-1`, none of the initial state variables are updated or affected by the code execution. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **distance_to_travel remains unchanged, distance_to_fuel_station remains unchanged, distance_after_fuel_station remains unchanged, fuel is reduced by either a - f or f depending on whether i is even, current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a), i is i_prev + 1**
