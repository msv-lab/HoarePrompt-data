### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input values `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Variables Initialization**: The variables `refuels`, `fuel`, `total_distance`, and `current_position` are initialized appropriately before the main logic.

3. **Loop Logic**: 
   - The loop iterates `k` times to simulate the bus making `k` journeys.
   - For each journey, the code determines the distances to travel (`distance_to_travel`) and the distances to the gas station (`distance_to_fuel_station`) and after the gas station (`distance_after_fuel_station`).
   - It checks if the bus has enough fuel to reach the gas station and refuels if necessary.
   - It calculates the remaining fuel after reaching the end of the journey and updates the position of the bus.
   
4. **Fuel Check and Refueling**:
   - Before traveling the distance to the gas station, the code checks if there is enough fuel.
   - If the fuel is insufficient, it prints `-1` and exits, which is correct because the bus cannot continue without refueling.
   - If the fuel is sufficient, it subtracts the required distance and checks if there is enough fuel to complete the rest of the journey to the next turn around.
   - If the fuel is insufficient, it refuels the tank to its full capacity `b` and then continues the journey.
   
5. **Position Update**: The position of the bus is updated modulo `2 * a` to account for the circular movement between `x = 0` and `x = a`.

6. **Output**: The final number of refuels is printed, which is the correct output based on the logic implemented.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the cases where the bus needs to refuel and ensures that the bus cannot proceed without sufficient fuel.

### Correctness:
**True**
