Reasoning:

1. The program correctly defines the variables `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` using the `input()` function and splits them into integers.
2. The variable `refuels` is initialized to count the number of refuels needed.
3. The variable `fuel` is initialized to represent the current amount of fuel in the bus's tank, starting with the full capacity `b`.
4. The variable `total_distance` is calculated as `2 * a * k`, which represents the total distance the bus needs to travel for `k` journeys.
5. A loop runs `k` times to simulate each journey.
6. Inside the loop, the program checks whether the bus needs to travel to the refueling station (`distance_to_fuel_station`) or from the refueling station back to the starting point (`distance_after_fuel_station`).
7. If the current fuel is insufficient to reach the refueling station, the program prints `-1` and exits.
8. Otherwise, it subtracts the necessary distance from the fuel and checks if more fuel is needed to cover the remaining distance. If so, it refuels the tank fully.
9. Finally, the program prints the total number of refuels required.

Given the problem statement and the logic implemented in the code, the program accurately calculates the minimum number of refuels needed for the bus to complete `k` journeys.

Correctness: **True**
