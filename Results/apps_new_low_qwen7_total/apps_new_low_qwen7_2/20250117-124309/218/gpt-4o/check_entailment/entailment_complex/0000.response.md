Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The function correctly initializes the variables `refuels`, `fuel`, and `current_position`.
2. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates `k` times, correctly alternating between the forward (`i % 2 == 0`) and backward (`i % 2 != 0`) journeys.
3. **Distance Calculation**: The code correctly calculates the distances to the fuel station and the remaining distance after reaching the fuel station.
4. **Refueling Condition**: The code checks if the fuel is sufficient to reach the next refueling point. If not, it refuels fully and increments the `refuels` counter.
5. **Current Position Update**: The code correctly updates the `current_position` using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the journey.
6. **Edge Cases**: The code properly handles the edge case where the initial fuel is insufficient to reach the first refueling point by printing `-1` and exiting the program.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function matches the requirements and handles all necessary scenarios correctly.

Correctness: **True**
