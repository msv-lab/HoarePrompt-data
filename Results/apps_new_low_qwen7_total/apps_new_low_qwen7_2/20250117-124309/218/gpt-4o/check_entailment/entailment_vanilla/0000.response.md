Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given Python function step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input values `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes variables `refuels`, `fuel`, `total_distance`, and `current_position` appropriately.

3. **Loop Through Journeys**: The loop iterates `k` times to simulate each journey.
   - For each journey, it calculates the distance to the fuel station (`distance_to_fuel_station`) and the distance after the fuel station (`distance_after_fuel_station`) based on whether the journey is from `0` to `a` or `a` to `0`.
   - It checks if the current fuel is sufficient to reach the fuel station. If not, it prints `-1` and exits, which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - If the fuel is insufficient after reaching the fuel station, it increments the `refuels` counter and refills the tank.
   - It then checks if the fuel is sufficient to complete the remaining journey after refueling. If not, it again increments the `refuels` counter and refills the tank.
   - Finally, it updates the `current_position` based on the journey direction.

4. **Output**: The function prints the total number of refuels required.

Given the analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the given Python function should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
