You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A bus moves along the coordinate line Ox from the point x = 0 to the point x = a. After starting from the point x = 0, it reaches the point x = a, immediately turns back and then moves to the point x = 0. After returning to the point x = 0 it immediately goes back to the point x = a and so on. Thus, the bus moves from x = 0 to x = a and back. Moving from the point x = 0 to x = a or from the point x = a to x = 0 is called a bus journey. In total, the bus must make k journeys.

The petrol tank of the bus can hold b liters of gasoline. To pass a single unit of distance the bus needs to spend exactly one liter of gasoline. The bus starts its first journey with a full petrol tank.

There is a gas station in point x = f. This point is between points x = 0 and x = a. There are no other gas stations on the bus route. While passing by a gas station in either direction the bus can stop and completely refuel its tank. Thus, after stopping to refuel the tank will contain b liters of gasoline.

What is the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel at the point x = f to make k journeys? The first journey starts in the point x = 0.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integers a, b, f, k (0 < f < a ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4) — the endpoint of the first bus journey, the capacity of the fuel tank of the bus, the point where the gas station is located, and the required number of journeys.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel to make k journeys. If it is impossible for the bus to make k journeys, print -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 9 2 4

Output
4

Input
6 10 2 4

Output
2

Input
6 5 4 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the bus needs to refuel during each journey.

In the second example the bus can pass 10 units of distance without refueling. So the bus makes the whole first journey, passes 4 units of the distance of the second journey and arrives at the point with the gas station. Then it can refuel its tank, finish the second journey and pass 2 units of distance from the third journey. In this case, it will again arrive at the point with the gas station. Further, he can refill the tank up to 10 liters to finish the third journey and ride all the way of the fourth journey. At the end of the journey the tank will be empty. 

In the third example the bus can not make all 3 journeys because if it refuels during the second journey, the tanks will contain only 5 liters of gasoline, but the bus needs to pass 8 units of distance until next refueling.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k`, where `0 < f < a ≤ 10^6`, `1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4`. It simulates a vehicle traveling back and forth between two points, each `a` units apart, for `k` trips. During each trip, the vehicle needs to refuel at specific distances defined by `f`. If the fuel is insufficient to reach the next refueling point, the vehicle refuels fully from `b` units of fuel before continuing. The function calculates and prints the total number of refuels required for the entire journey. The function also handles the case where the initial fuel is insufficient to reach the first refueling point, in which case it prints `-1` and exits.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the bus cannot complete all journeys due to insufficient fuel between refueling stops. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where the bus's remaining fuel after reaching the gas station is less than the distance to the next refueling point, which happens in the third example provided in the problem statement.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
6 5 4 3
```

In this case, the bus has a fuel capacity of 5 liters, and the gas station is at x = 4. The total distance for one round trip is 12 units. The bus needs to make 3 journeys.

- For the first journey, the bus travels 6 units to x = 6, then 4 units back to x = 2.
- The remaining fuel is 5 - 4 = 1 liter.
- It needs to travel 6 units to x = 6 again, but with only 1 liter of fuel, it cannot reach x = 6. Therefore, it should not proceed without refueling, but the current implementation does not account for this and will incorrectly proceed, leading to insufficient fuel for subsequent journeys.

This example demonstrates that the program does not handle the case where the bus cannot complete a journey due to insufficient fuel, making the program incorrect.
