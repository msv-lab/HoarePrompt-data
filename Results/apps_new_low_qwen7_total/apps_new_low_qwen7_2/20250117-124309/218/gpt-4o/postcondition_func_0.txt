The function `func()` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k`, where `0 < f < a ≤ 10^6`, `1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4`. It simulates a vehicle traveling back and forth between two points, each `a` units apart, for `k` trips. During each trip, the vehicle needs to refuel at specific distances defined by `f`. If the fuel is insufficient to reach the next refueling point, the vehicle refuels fully from `b` units of fuel before continuing. The function calculates and prints the total number of refuels required for the entire journey. The function also handles the case where the initial fuel is insufficient to reach the first refueling point, in which case it prints `-1` and exits.
