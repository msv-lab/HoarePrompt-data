### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program handles the edge cases where the two given points are either horizontally or vertically aligned. However, there are a few issues with the logic that the original assessment did not address:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Coordinates:**
   - In the case where `x1 == x2`, the program correctly calculates the x-coordinates of the other two trees as `x3` and `x4` using the absolute difference in y-coordinates. This is correct.
   - Similarly, when `x1 != x2`, the program correctly calculates the y-coordinates of the other two trees as `y3` and `y4` using the absolute difference in x-coordinates. This is also correct.

2. **Boundary Check:**
   - The boundary check is correctly implemented. If the calculated coordinates fall within the range `[-1000, 1000]`, the program prints them; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program. Specifically, the program assumes that the given points are vertices of a square. This assumption is incorrect because the problem statement guarantees that the given points are distinct and do not necessarily form a square.

### Example:
Consider the input:
```
0 0 1 1
```
- Here, the points `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)` are given. According to the program, the x-coordinates of the other two points would be `0 + |0 - 1| = 1` and `0 - |0 - 1| = -1`. Similarly, the y-coordinates would be `0 + |0 - 1| = 1` and `0 - |0 - 1| = -1`.

- The resulting coordinates would be `(1, 1)` and `(-1, -1)`. These points do not form a square with the given points `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)`.

Therefore, the program's logic fails to ensure that the calculated points form a square, which is a requirement of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the handling of edge cases and boundary checks, but it failed to recognize the logical error in assuming that the given points form a square. The program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
