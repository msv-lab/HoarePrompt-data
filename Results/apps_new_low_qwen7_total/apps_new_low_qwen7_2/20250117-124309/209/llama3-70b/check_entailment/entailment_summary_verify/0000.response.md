### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the given examples to determine its correctness.

#### Example 1: Input - `0 0 0 1`
- Given Points: \((0, 0)\) and \((0, 1)\)
- Expected Output: \((1, 0)\) and \((1, 1)\)

In this case, the points are vertical, so the program correctly calculates the other two points by adding and subtracting the absolute difference in the y-coordinates from the x-coordinates.

#### Example 2: Input - `0 0 1 1`
- Given Points: \((0, 0)\) and \((1, 1)\)
- Expected Output: \((0, 1)\) and \((1, 0)\)

Here, the points are diagonal. The program swaps the coordinates, which is incorrect for forming a square. The correct coordinates should be \((1, 0)\) and \((0, 1)\).

#### Example 3: Input - `0 0 1 2`
- Given Points: \((0, 0)\) and \((1, 2)\)
- Expected Output: `-1`

In this case, the points do not form a square, so the program correctly outputs `-1`.

Now let's look at the provided function summary and the program code:

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function calculates new coordinates based on the given conditions.
   - If `x1 == x2`, it computes `x3` and `x4` as `x1 + abs(y1 - y2)` and `x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`, respectively, while setting `y3` and `y4` to `y1` and `y2`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `y3` and `y4` as `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)` and `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`, respectively, while keeping `x3` and `x4` as `x1` and `x2`.

2. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - The program handles the case when the points are vertical or horizontal.
   - It correctly calculates the other two points for vertical or horizontal lines.
   - It does not handle the diagonal case correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for diagonal inputs.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is partially correct but not entirely accurate. The program does not handle the diagonal case correctly, which can lead to incorrect outputs. Therefore, the program is not fully correct as per the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the diagonal case properly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
