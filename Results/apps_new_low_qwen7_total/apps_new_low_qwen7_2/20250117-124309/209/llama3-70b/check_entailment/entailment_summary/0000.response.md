Reasoning: 
The provided program attempts to find the positions of the other two trees in a square garden based on the given coordinates of two trees. However, there are a few issues in the logic and handling of edge cases:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Coordinates**: The logic for calculating the coordinates of the other two trees is flawed. If `x1 == x2`, the program should consider the differences in the y-coordinates to determine the x-coordinates of the other two trees, and vice versa for when `y1 == y2`. The current logic incorrectly adds or subtracts the absolute difference in the opposite axis.

2. **Handling of Diagonal Gardens**: The program assumes that the given points are adjacent vertices of the square. However, the problem statement guarantees that the points are distinct and the garden is a square, which means the distance between the points should be equal in both dimensions if they are adjacent vertices of the square.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all possible edge cases correctly. For example, if the given points are diagonally opposite, the program will fail to provide a valid solution.

Let's review the examples provided in the problem:

- **Example 1**: Input `0 0 0 1`. Expected Output `1 0 1 1`. The program would calculate `(1, 0)` and `(1, 1)` but the correct calculation should be `(1, 1)` and `(0, 1)`.

- **Example 2**: Input `0 0 1 1`. Expected Output `0 1 1 0`. This example is correctly handled.

- **Example 3**: Input `0 0 1 2`. Expected Output `-1`. This case is correctly identified as impossible because the points cannot form a square with the given constraints.

Given these issues, the program needs significant modifications to handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the provided program is not correct as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
