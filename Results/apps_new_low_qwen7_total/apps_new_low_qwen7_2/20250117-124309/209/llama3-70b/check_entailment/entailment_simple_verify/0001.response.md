### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements and the original assessment.

#### Input Handling
- The program correctly reads four integer inputs representing the coordinates of two trees, which matches the problem description.

#### Edge Case Handling
- If `x1 == x2`, the program calculates the x-coordinates of the other two trees as `x3` and `x4` using the absolute difference in y-coordinates. However, this approach is flawed because it assumes that the two given points are aligned horizontally, but it does not handle the vertical alignment correctly.
- Similarly, if `x1 != x2`, the program calculates the y-coordinates of the other two trees using the absolute difference in x-coordinates, again assuming horizontal alignment.

For example, consider the following input:
```
0 0 0 1
```
- The program will calculate:
  - `x3` and `x4` as `0 + 1` and `0 - 1`, resulting in `1` and `-1`.
  - `y3` and `y4` as `0` and `1`, which are the same as the given points.
- This will result in the output:
  ```
  1 0 -1 1
  ```
- However, these coordinates do not form a valid square because the points `(1, 0)` and `(-1, 1)` are not aligned properly with the given points `(0, 0)` and `(0, 1)`.

Similarly, for the input:
```
0 0 1 1
```
- The program will calculate:
  - `x3` and `x4` as `0` and `1`, which are the same as the given points.
  - `y3` and `y4` as `0 + 1` and `0 - 1`, resulting in `1` and `-1`.
- This will result in the output:
  ```
  0 1 1 -1
  ```
- Again, these coordinates do not form a valid square.

#### Boundary Check
- The program checks if the calculated coordinates fall within the specified range (`-1000` to `1000`). However, the logic for calculating the coordinates is flawed, so even if the coordinates are within the range, they may not form a valid square.

#### Conclusion
- The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the program correctly calculates the coordinates of the other two trees. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not correctly handle the alignment of the points to form a valid square.

Given this analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the coordinates of the other two trees to form a valid square.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
