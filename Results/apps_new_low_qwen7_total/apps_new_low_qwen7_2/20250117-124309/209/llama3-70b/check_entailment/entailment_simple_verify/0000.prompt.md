You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Pashmak has fallen in love with an attractive girl called Parmida since one year ago...

Today, Pashmak set up a meeting with his partner in a romantic garden. Unfortunately, Pashmak has forgotten where the garden is. But he remembers that the garden looks like a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. He also remembers that there is exactly one tree on each vertex of the square. Now, Pashmak knows the position of only two of the trees. Help him to find the position of two remaining ones.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four space-separated x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ( - 100 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 100) integers, where x_1 and y_1 are coordinates of the first tree and x_2 and y_2 are coordinates of the second tree. It's guaranteed that the given points are distinct.


-----Output-----

If there is no solution to the problem, print -1. Otherwise print four space-separated integers x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 that correspond to the coordinates of the two other trees. If there are several solutions you can output any of them. 

Note that x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 must be in the range ( - 1000 ≤ x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 ≤ 1000).

- Program: 
def func():
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x2:
        (x3, x4) = (x1 + abs(y1 - y2), x1 - abs(y1 - y2))
        (y3, y4) = (y1, y2)
    else:
        (y3, y4) = (y1 + abs(x1 - x2), y1 - abs(x1 - x2))
        (x3, x4) = (x1, x2)
    if -1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and (-1000 <= y3 <= 1000) and (-1000 <= y4 <= 1000):
        print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
    else:
        print(-1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four space-separated integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, where -100 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 100, and x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 are distinct. The coordinates (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) represent the positions of two trees in a square garden.
def func():
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    if (x1 == x2) :
        x3, x4 = x1 + abs(y1 - y2), x1 - abs(y1 - y2)

y3, y4 = y1, y2
    else :
        y3, y4 = y1 + abs(x1 - x2), y1 - abs(x1 - x2)

x3, x4 = x1, x2
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `y3` is either `y1` plus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y1`, and `y4` is either `y1` minus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y2`. If `x1` equals `x2`, then `x3` is 2 times the absolute value of (`y1` - `y2`), otherwise `x3` and `x4` are input integers.
    if (-1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and -1000 <= y3 <= 1000 and -
    1000 <= y4 <= 1000) :
        print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `y3` is either `y1` plus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y1`, `y4` is either `y1` minus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y2`, `x3` and `x4` are input integers, and the print statement outputs `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4`. This holds true if the condition `-1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and (-1000 <= y3 <= 1000) and (-1000 <= y4 <= 1000)` is satisfied. Otherwise, `x3` and `x4` remain as input integers, and the condition is not met.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the two given points form a diagonal of the square. For example, if the input is `0 0 1 1`, the program will incorrectly output `0 1 1 0`. However, this configuration does not form a valid square. Instead, it forms a degenerate square (a line segment). To handle this case correctly, the program needs to check if the given points are diagonal and handle this scenario separately by swapping their coordinates.
