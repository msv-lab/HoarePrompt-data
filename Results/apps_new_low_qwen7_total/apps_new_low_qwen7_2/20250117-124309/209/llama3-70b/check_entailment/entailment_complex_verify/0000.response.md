### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and examples.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program takes four integers \( (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) \) as input.
   - These coordinates are assigned to variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - If \( x1 == x2 \):
     - This implies that the two given points lie on the same vertical line.
     - In this case, the coordinates of the other two vertices of the square can be derived by shifting the y-coordinates of the given points by the absolute difference in their y-values.
     - Specifically, the new coordinates are \( (x1 + |y1 - y2|, y1) \) and \( (x1 - |y1 - y2|, y1) \).
   - If \( x1 != x2 \):
     - This implies that the two given points lie on the same horizontal line.
     - In this case, the coordinates of the other two vertices of the square can be derived by shifting the x-coordinates of the given points by the absolute difference in their x-values.
     - Specifically, the new coordinates are \( (x1, y1 + |x1 - x2|) \) and \( (x1, y1 - |x1 - x2|) \).

3. **Range Check:**
   - After calculating the new coordinates, the program checks if all coordinates are within the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
   - If all coordinates are within the range, the program prints the coordinates.
   - If any coordinate is out of range, the program prints `-1`.

Now, let's consider the provided examples and the edge cases mentioned in the original assessment:

- **Example 1:** Input: `0 0 0 1`
  - The two points are on the same vertical line.
  - The other two points would be \( (0, 0+1) = (0, 1) \) and \( (0, 0-1) = (0, -1) \).
  - Since we only need to output any valid configuration, one possible output is \( (1, 0) \) and \( (1, 1) \), which is correct.

- **Example 2:** Input: `0 0 1 1`
  - The two points are on the same diagonal.
  - This configuration does not form a valid square but a degenerate square (a line segment).
  - The program should handle this case by ensuring it prints `-1` since no valid square can be formed from these points.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was partially correct in identifying the issue with the diagonal case. However, the program's handling of the vertical and horizontal cases is correct. The program should indeed print `-1` for the diagonal case, but it does not explicitly check for this scenario. The original assessment did not fully account for the fact that the program does not handle the diagonal case correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the given points form a diagonal of the square. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in pointing out this issue. However, the overall functionality of the program for valid cases is correct.

**Final: False**
