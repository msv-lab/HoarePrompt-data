Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Pashmak has fallen in love with an attractive girl called Parmida since one year ago...

Today, Pashmak set up a meeting with his partner in a romantic garden. Unfortunately, Pashmak has forgotten where the garden is. But he remembers that the garden looks like a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. He also remembers that there is exactly one tree on each vertex of the square. Now, Pashmak knows the position of only two of the trees. Help him to find the position of two remaining ones.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four space-separated x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ( - 100 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 100) integers, where x_1 and y_1 are coordinates of the first tree and x_2 and y_2 are coordinates of the second tree. It's guaranteed that the given points are distinct.


-----Output-----

If there is no solution to the problem, print -1. Otherwise print four space-separated integers x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 that correspond to the coordinates of the two other trees. If there are several solutions you can output any of them. 

Note that x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 must be in the range ( - 1000 ≤ x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 ≤ 1000).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four space-separated integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, where -100 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 100, and x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 are distinct. The coordinates (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) represent the positions of two trees in a square garden.
def func():
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    if (x1 == x2) :
        x3, x4 = x1 + abs(y1 - y2), x1 - abs(y1 - y2)

y3, y4 = y1, y2
    else :
        y3, y4 = y1 + abs(x1 - x2), y1 - abs(x1 - x2)

x3, x4 = x1, x2
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `y3` is either `y1` plus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y1`, and `y4` is either `y1` minus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y2`. If `x1` equals `x2`, then `x3` is 2 times the absolute value of (`y1` - `y2`), otherwise `x3` and `x4` are input integers.
    if (-1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and -1000 <= y3 <= 1000 and -
    1000 <= y4 <= 1000) :
        print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `y3` is either `y1` plus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y1`, `y4` is either `y1` minus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y2`, `x3` and `x4` are input integers, and the print statement outputs `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4`. This holds true if the condition `-1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and (-1000 <= y3 <= 1000) and (-1000 <= y4 <= 1000)` is satisfied. Otherwise, `x3` and `x4` remain as input integers, and the condition is not met.
