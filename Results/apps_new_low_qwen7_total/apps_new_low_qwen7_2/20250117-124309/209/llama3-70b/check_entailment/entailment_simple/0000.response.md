Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but has some logical flaws and missing parts that make it incomplete and incorrect for all possible cases.

1. **Logic for Determining the Fourth Vertex**: 
   - If the two given points are `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, the fourth vertex of the square can be determined by considering the relative positions of these points.
   - If the points share the same x-coordinate, they are horizontally aligned, and the fourth point will have the y-coordinates of the two points and the x-coordinates swapped. However, the logic provided does not correctly handle this case.
   - If the points share the same y-coordinate, they are vertically aligned, and the fourth point will have the x-coordinates of the two points and the y-coordinates swapped. Again, the provided logic does not handle this case correctly.

2. **Missing Cases**:
   - The current implementation does not handle the case when the two given points are adjacent vertices of the square. In such a case, the fourth vertex cannot be determined directly from the given information without additional constraints.
   - The provided code does not check for these conditions properly and prints a fixed pair of values without ensuring that the coordinates form a valid square.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The example inputs provided in the comments show that the program fails to handle some edge cases, such as the input `(0, 0, 1, 2)`, which should result in `-1` because no valid square can be formed with these points.

Given the above issues, the provided solution is incomplete and incorrect for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
