Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the two given points form a diagonal of the square. For example, if the input is `0 0 1 1`, the program will incorrectly output `0 1 1 0`. However, this configuration does not form a valid square. Instead, it forms a degenerate square (a line segment). To handle this case correctly, the program needs to check if the given points are diagonal and handle this scenario separately by swapping their coordinates.
