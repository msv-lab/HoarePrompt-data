Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and ensure it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads four integer inputs representing the coordinates of two trees.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the case where the two given points have the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate separately.
   - If `x1 == x2`, it calculates the x-coordinates of the other two trees as `x3` and `x4` using the absolute difference in y-coordinates. The y-coordinates remain the same as the given points.
   - If `x1 != x2`, it calculates the y-coordinates of the other two trees similarly, and the x-coordinates remain the same.
3. **Boundary Check**: The program checks if the calculated coordinates fall within the specified range (`-1000` to `1000`). If they do, it prints the coordinates; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Given this analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the logic for finding the positions of the other two trees based on the given constraints. It handles all cases where the trees might be aligned horizontally or vertically and ensures the coordinates are within the valid range.

Therefore, the given program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
