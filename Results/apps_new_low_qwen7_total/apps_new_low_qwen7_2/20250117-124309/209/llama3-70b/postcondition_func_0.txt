The function accepts four distinct integers `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, and `y_2`, each in the range -100 to 100, representing the coordinates of two trees in a square garden. It calculates new coordinates `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` based on the given conditions. If `x1 == x2`, it computes `x3` and `x4` as `x1 + abs(y1 - y2)` and `x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`, respectively, while setting `y3` and `y4` to `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, it sets `y3` and `y4` as `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)` and `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`, respectively, while keeping `x3` and `x4` as `x1` and `x2`.

After calculating these values, the function checks if the new coordinates `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` fall within the range [-1000, 1000]. If they do, it prints these coordinates; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the program by printing the calculated coordinates or `-1`.
