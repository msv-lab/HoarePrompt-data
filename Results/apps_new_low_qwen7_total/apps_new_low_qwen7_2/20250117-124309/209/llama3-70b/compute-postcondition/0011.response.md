The function `func` accepts four parameters: `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, and `y_2`. Each of these parameters is an integer, and they must satisfy the conditions -100 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 100, and they must be distinct. 

The function returns a value based on the relationship between the points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2). However, since no specific logic or output cases are provided in the problem statement, we can only state the parameters and their constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four integers `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, and `y_2`, each constrained to the range -100 to 100 and being distinct, and then perform some unspecified operation based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, and `y_2`, each an integer in the range -100 to 100, and distinct, and returns an unspecified value based on these parameters.**
