The code prints the values of `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4`. Since these values are already determined in the initial state, printing them does not change their values. The output of the print statement is simply the values of these variables.

Output State: **`x3` is 2 times the absolute value of (`y1` - `y2`), `x4` is an input integer, `y3` is either `y1` plus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y1`, `y4` is either `y1` minus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y2`, and the print statement outputs `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4`**.
