Output State: **x1 is an input integer, x2 is an input integer, x3 is 2*abs(y1 - y2), x4 is 0, y1 is an input integer, y2 is an input integer, y3 is y1, y4 is y2**

Explanation:
- The first line creates two new variables `x3` and `x4`. 
  - `x3` is assigned the value of `x1 + abs(y1 - y2)`. Since `x1` is equal to `x2`, and `x4` is assigned the value of `x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`, we can deduce that `x4` will be 0 because `x1` cancels out with `-abs(y1 - y2)`.
- The second line creates two more variables `y3` and `y4`.
  - `y3` is assigned the value of `y1`.
  - `y4` is assigned the value of `y2`.

All other variables (`x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`) remain unchanged as they are not reassigned.
