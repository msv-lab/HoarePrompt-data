Postcondition: **`x1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `y3` is either `y1` plus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y1`, and `y4` is either `y1` minus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y2`. `x3` is 2 times the absolute value of (`y1` - `y2`), `x4` is an input integer. All values satisfy the conditions: -1000 <= `x3` <= 1000, -1000 <= `x4` <= 1000, -1000 <= `y3` <= 1000, and -1000 <= `y4` <= 1000.**
