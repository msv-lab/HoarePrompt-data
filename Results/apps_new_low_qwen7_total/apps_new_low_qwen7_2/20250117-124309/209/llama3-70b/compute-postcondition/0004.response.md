Output State: **x1 is an input integer, x2 is an input integer, x3 is an input integer, x4 is an input integer, y1 is an input integer, y2 is an input integer, y3 is y1 + absolute value of (x1 - x2), y4 is y1 - absolute value of (x1 - x2)**

Explanation:
1. The first line `y3, y4 = y1 + abs(x1 - x2), y1 - abs(x1 - x2)` calculates the values for `y3` and `y4` based on the given formulae. 
   - `y3` is set to `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)`.
   - `y4` is set to `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`.
2. The second line `x3, x4 = x1, x2` swaps the values of `x3` and `x4` to be exactly the same as `x1` and `x2` respectively. Since `x1` is not equal to `x2`, `x3` and `x4` will now hold the values of `x1` and `x2` respectively.

No other variables are modified by the code block. Therefore, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` retain their initial input values, while `x3` and `x4` take the values of `x1` and `x2` respectively, and `y3` and `y4` are derived from `y1` and the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2`.
