Postcondition: **`x1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `y3` is either `y1` plus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y1`, and `y4` is either `y1` minus the absolute value of (`x1` - `x2`) or `y2`, and `x3` and `x4` are input integers, and the condition `-1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and (-1000 <= y3 <= 1000) and (-1000 <= y4 <= 1000)` is false**
