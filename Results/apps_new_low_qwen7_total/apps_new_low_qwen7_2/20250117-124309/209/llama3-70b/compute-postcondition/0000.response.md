The code reads four space-separated integers as inputs and assigns them to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. These inputs represent the coordinates of two trees in a square garden. Since the input values are read from the user, the specific values of these variables will depend on the user's input, but they will be integers between -100 and 100, and they will be distinct.

Output State: **`x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer**
