#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the length of the string s, and s is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, s):
    min_operations = n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]:
            operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
            min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `min_operations` is the minimum value of `operations` computed within the loop.
    return min_operations
    #The program returns min_operations which is the minimum value of operations computed within the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the length of the string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. It computes the minimum number of operations required to transform the string `s` into a palindrome through a specific operation. The operation involves checking if a prefix of the string matches a suffix, and if so, calculating the number of operations needed based on the length of the matching prefix. The function returns the minimum number of operations found during these checks.
