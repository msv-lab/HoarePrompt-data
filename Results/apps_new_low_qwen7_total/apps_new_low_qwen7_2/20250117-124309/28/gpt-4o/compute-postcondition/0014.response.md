Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the length of the string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. It computes the minimum number of operations required to transform the string `s` into a palindrome through a specific operation. The operation involves checking if a prefix of the string matches a suffix, and if so, calculating the number of operations needed based on the length of the matching prefix. The function returns the minimum number of operations found during these checks.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the string `s` is already a palindrome, the function will still iterate through the loop but will find no matching prefixes that can reduce the number of operations, thus returning the initial value of `min_operations` which is `n`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided code does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1. In such cases, the string `s` is trivially a palindrome (or empty), and the function should return `0` since no operations are needed. This should be included in the functionality summary.
