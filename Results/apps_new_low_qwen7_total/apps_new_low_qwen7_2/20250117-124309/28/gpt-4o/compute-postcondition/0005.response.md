Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
   - `min_operations` is `n`.

3. **Loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - The string `s` and `min_operations` do not change based on the loop head variables alone; they depend on the loop body execution.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` must be 2.
   - `n` remains an integer.
   - `s` remains a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
   - `min_operations` remains `n`.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `min_operations` is `n`.**
