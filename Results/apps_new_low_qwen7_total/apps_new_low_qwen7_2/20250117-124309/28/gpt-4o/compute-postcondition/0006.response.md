Based on the given code snippet and the initial state, let's analyze the impact of each line on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer
- `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters
- `min_operations` is `n`

### Code Snippet:
```python
operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
```

### Line-by-Line Analysis:

1. **First Line: `operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)`**
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - The expression `i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)` simplifies to `1 + n - i`.
   - Substituting `i = 2`, we get `1 + n - 2`, which further simplifies to `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `operations` is set to `n - 1`.

2. **Second Line: `min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)`**
   - `min_operations` is currently `n`.
   - `operations` is `n - 1`.
   - The `min` function will choose the smaller value between `n` and `n - 1`, which is `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `min_operations` is updated to `n - 1`.

### Updated State After Execution of the Code Snippet:
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains an integer.
- `s` remains a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `min_operations` is now `n - 1`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **i is 2, n is an integer, s is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, min_operations is n - 1**
