Output State: **i is 4, n is an integer, s is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, min_operations is 3**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates the value of `operations` as `i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)`. Given `i` is 3, this expression simplifies to `3 + 1 + (n - 2 * 3)` which is `4 + n - 6` or `n - 2`. Therefore, `operations` is set to `n - 2`.
- The second line updates `min_operations` to be the minimum value between its current value (`n`) and the newly calculated `operations` (`n - 2`). Since `n` is greater than or equal to `n - 2`, `min_operations` remains unchanged at `n`.

Since no other variables are affected, the values of `i`, `s`, and `min_operations` remain as specified in the initial state.
