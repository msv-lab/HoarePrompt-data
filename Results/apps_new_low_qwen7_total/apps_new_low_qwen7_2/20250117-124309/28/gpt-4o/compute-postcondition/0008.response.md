Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an integer
   - `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters
   - `min_operations` is `n`

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive). This means the loop will start with `i = 1` if it hasn't already.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - Since the loop condition does not depend on the value of `s` or `min_operations` directly (only on `i` and `n`), these values remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.

Given the information, the only state that changes is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `min_operations` is `n`**.
