`min_operations` is assigned the value of `n`. The value of `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters; `min_operations` is `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters; `min_operations` is `n`**
