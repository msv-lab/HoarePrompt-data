The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the length of the string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. It computes the minimum number of operations required to transform the string `s` into a palindrome through a specific operation. The operation involves checking if a prefix of the string matches a suffix, and if so, calculating the number of operations needed based on the length of the matching prefix. The function returns the minimum number of operations found during these checks.
