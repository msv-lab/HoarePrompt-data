Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem asks to find the minimum number of operations to type a given string, where you can either type one character at a time or copy the entire string once and append it to itself. However, the function `func_1` attempts to find a way to make the string a palindrome by checking if prefixes match suffixes, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

Here's a more accurate description of the solution logic needed:
- The main idea is to use the copy operation optimally to minimize the total number of operations.
- For any substring, if we can find a point where copying the string up to that point and appending it again helps in reducing the total number of operations, we should do so.

Let's break down the steps:
1. If the string is already of even length, the minimum operations would be `n/2` because you can copy the first half and append it to the second half.
2. If the string is of odd length, you can copy the first `(n//2)` characters and then type the remaining characters.
3. We need to check if there's a point where copying the string up to that point and appending it helps in reducing the operations.

The provided function does not implement this logic. Instead, it tries to find palindromic substrings, which is not necessary for solving the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
