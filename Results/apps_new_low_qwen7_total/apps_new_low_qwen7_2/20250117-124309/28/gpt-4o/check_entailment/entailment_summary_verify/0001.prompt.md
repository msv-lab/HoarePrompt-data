You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.

Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation:  add a character to the end of the string. 

Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.

For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.

If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

Print the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containing only one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string you have to type. The second line containing the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
abcabca

Output
5

Input
8
abcdefgh

Output
8



-----Note-----

The first test described in the problem statement.

In the second test you can only type all the characters one by one.

- Program:
n = int(input())
s = input()
result = func_1(n, s)
print(result)

def func_1(n, s):
    min_operations = n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]:
            operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
            min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
    return min_operations



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the length of the string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. It computes the minimum number of operations required to transform the string `s` into a palindrome through a specific operation. The operation involves checking if a prefix of the string matches a suffix, and if so, calculating the number of operations needed based on the length of the matching prefix. The function returns the minimum number of operations found during these checks.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The provided program has two main parts:
   - Reading input and calling the `func_1` function.
   - The implementation of `func_1` which calculates the minimum number of operations required.

2. The logic in `func_1` seems to be checking for the possibility of copying a substring to minimize the total operations needed:
   - It iterates through possible substrings that could be copied (`i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`).
   - For each `i`, it checks if the substring `s[:i]` is equal to `s[i:2*i]`.
   - If they are equal, it calculates the total operations as `i + 1 + (n - 2*i)`, where:
     - `i + 1` accounts for typing the initial substring and copying it.
     - `(n - 2*i)` accounts for typing the remaining characters after the copy.
   - It updates `min_operations` with the minimum value found.

3. This logic aims to find the optimal point to copy the string, but there's a potential flaw:
   - The formula `i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)` does not account for cases where copying earlier in the string might yield better results if there are repeating patterns later.
   - The current approach only considers one possible starting point for copying (`s[:i] == s[i:2*i]`).

4. However, the provided examples show that the code works correctly for those specific cases:
   - Example 1 (`abcabca`) results in 5 operations, which matches the expected output.
   - Example 2 (`abcdefgh`) results in 8 operations, which also matches the expected output.

Given these observations, the program appears to handle the provided test cases correctly. However, the logic could be improved for more general cases where the optimal copy position might not align perfectly with the mid-point of the string.
