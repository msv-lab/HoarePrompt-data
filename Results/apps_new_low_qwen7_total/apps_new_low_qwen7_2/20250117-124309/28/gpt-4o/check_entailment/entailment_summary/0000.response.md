Reasoning:
The provided program does not match the problem description correctly. The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to type a given string using a specific set of operations (adding characters one by one or copying the entire string once). However, the provided code attempts to find the minimum number of operations to transform the string into a palindrome, which is not what the problem specifies.

The function `func_1` in the provided code:
- Iterates over possible prefixes of the string.
- Checks if the prefix matches a suffix of the same length.
- If a match is found, it calculates the number of operations needed assuming that part of the string has already been typed and only the remaining part needs to be added.

This approach does not solve the given problem but rather addresses a different string transformation challenge. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
