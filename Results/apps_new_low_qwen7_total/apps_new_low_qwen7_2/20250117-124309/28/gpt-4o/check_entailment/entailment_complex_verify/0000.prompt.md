You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.

Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation:  add a character to the end of the string. 

Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.

For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.

If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

Print the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containing only one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string you have to type. The second line containing the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
abcabca

Output
5

Input
8
abcdefgh

Output
8



-----Note-----

The first test described in the problem statement.

In the second test you can only type all the characters one by one.

- Program: 
n = int(input())
s = input()
result = func_1(n, s)
print(result)

def func_1(n, s):
    min_operations = n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]:
            operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
            min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
    return min_operations



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
s = input()
result = func_1(n, s)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the length of the string s, and s is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, s):
    min_operations = n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]:
            operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
            min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `min_operations` is the minimum value of `operations` computed within the loop.
    return min_operations
    #The program returns min_operations which is the minimum value of operations computed within the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the length of the string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. It computes the minimum number of operations required to transform the string `s` into a palindrome through a specific operation. The operation involves checking if a prefix of the string matches a suffix, and if so, calculating the number of operations needed based on the length of the matching prefix. The function returns the minimum number of operations found during these checks.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to type the given string. Specifically, the logic inside the `func_1` function does not properly handle the case where the string can be divided into two equal parts and the copy operation is used optimally.

Consider the string `s = "aaabaaab"`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to type "aaa", then copy it, and finally type "baa". This should result in a minimum of 5 operations. However, the current implementation does not account for the possibility of copying a larger segment of the string that includes the middle part.

The current implementation checks for prefixes that match suffixes of the same length but does not explore longer segments that might include the middle part of the string. For instance, it does not consider whether the string can be split into a prefix and a suffix that are not of equal length but still allow for an optimal solution involving a copy operation.

A correct approach would involve checking for the longest palindromic prefix that can be copied and then calculating the remaining operations needed to complete the string.
