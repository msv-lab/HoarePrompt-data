Reasoning:

1. The provided program has two main parts:
   - Reading input and calling the `func_1` function.
   - The implementation of `func_1` which calculates the minimum number of operations required.

2. The logic in `func_1` seems to be checking for the possibility of copying a substring to minimize the total operations needed:
   - It iterates through possible substrings that could be copied (`i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`).
   - For each `i`, it checks if the substring `s[:i]` is equal to `s[i:2*i]`.
   - If they are equal, it calculates the total operations as `i + 1 + (n - 2*i)`, where:
     - `i + 1` accounts for typing the initial substring and copying it.
     - `(n - 2*i)` accounts for typing the remaining characters after the copy.
   - It updates `min_operations` with the minimum value found.

3. This logic aims to find the optimal point to copy the string, but there's a potential flaw:
   - The formula `i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)` does not account for cases where copying earlier in the string might yield better results if there are repeating patterns later.
   - The current approach only considers one possible starting point for copying (`s[:i] == s[i:2*i]`).

4. However, the provided examples show that the code works correctly for those specific cases:
   - Example 1 (`abcabca`) results in 5 operations, which matches the expected output.
   - Example 2 (`abcdefgh`) results in 8 operations, which also matches the expected output.

Given these observations, the program appears to handle the provided test cases correctly. However, the logic could be improved for more general cases where the optimal copy position might not align perfectly with the mid-point of the string.

Correctness: **True**
