Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to type the given string. Specifically, the logic inside the `func_1` function does not properly handle the case where the string can be divided into two equal parts and the copy operation is used optimally.

Consider the string `s = "aaabaaab"`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to type "aaa", then copy it, and finally type "baa". This should result in a minimum of 5 operations. However, the current implementation does not account for the possibility of copying a larger segment of the string that includes the middle part.

The current implementation checks for prefixes that match suffixes of the same length but does not explore longer segments that might include the middle part of the string. For instance, it does not consider whether the string can be split into a prefix and a suffix that are not of equal length but still allow for an optimal solution involving a copy operation.

A correct approach would involve checking for the longest palindromic prefix that can be copied and then calculating the remaining operations needed to complete the string.
