Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n - 2`.
   - `dp[i]` is updated based on the condition if `s[j:i]` is a substring of `s[:j]`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(i):`
   - This means `j` will iterate from `0` to `i-1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i = n + 1`
   - `j = n - 2`

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to increment.
   - Since `j` starts at `n - 2` and the loop iterates over `range(i)`, the next value of `j` would be `n - 1`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes within each iteration is `j`.
   - Therefore, we need to update `j` to `n - 1`.

6. **Final State:**
   - All other variables (`n`, `s`, `dp`, `i`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

**State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters; `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`; `i` is `n + 1`; `j` is `n - 1`; `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[j])` if `s[j:i]` is a substring of `s[:j]`; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
