Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `1`.
   - The loop updates `dp[i]` based on the condition `s[j:i]` being found in `s[:j]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `i`.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 (since it starts from `0`).
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < i`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `1`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` should be `2` (incremented by 1).

Since `i` remains unchanged, it is still `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to:
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `2`.

State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `2`**
