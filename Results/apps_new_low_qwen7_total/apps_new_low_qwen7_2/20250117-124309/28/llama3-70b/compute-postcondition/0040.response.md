Let's analyze the given code and initial state step-by-step to determine the final output state after all executions of the loop.

### Initial State
- \( n \) is an integer (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100)
- \( s \) is a string of \( n \) lowercase Latin letters
- \( dp \) is a list of length \( n+1 \) initialized to zeros with \( dp[0] = 0 \)

### Loop Analysis
The outer loop runs from 1 to \( n \):
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
```
For each \( i \), the inner loop runs from 0 to \( i-1 \):
```python
for j in range(i):
```
Inside the inner loop, there is a condition that checks if the substring \( s[j:i] \) exists in the prefix \( s[:j] \):
```python
if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
```
If this condition is true, the value of \( dp[i] \) is updated as follows:
```python
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
```

### Tracking Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: 
  - \( dp[0] = 0 \) remains constant throughout the loop.
- **Variable Changes**:
  - \( dp[i] \) changes based on the conditions in the loop.

### Summarizing the Loop Behavior
- The loop updates \( dp[i] \) based on the minimum value found by checking substrings.
- If the substring \( s[j:i] \) does not exist in \( s[:j] \), then \( dp[i] \) remains unchanged.

### Verifying Relationships
From the given outputs:
- After the loop executes 1 time: \( dp[1] = 1 \), and \( dp[i] \) for \( i > 1 \) is updated based on the substring condition.
- After the loop executes 2 times: \( dp[i] = n + 1 \) for all \( i \).
- After the loop executes 3 times: \( dp[i] = 1 \).

### Final Output State
- \( n \) remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- \( s \) remains a string of \( n \) lowercase Latin letters.
- \( dp[0] = 0 \) remains constant.
- \( dp[i] \) for \( i > 0 \) will eventually stabilize to either 1 or \( n + 1 \) depending on the string \( s \).

Given the final outputs provided, it appears that the loop stabilizes \( dp[i] \) to either 1 or \( n + 1 \). Specifically, if the substring condition is always false, \( dp[i] \) will be \( n + 1 \). Otherwise, \( dp[i] \) will be 1.

Thus, the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is:
Output State: **\( n \) is an integer between 1 and 100, \( s \) is a string of \( n \) lowercase Latin letters, \( dp[0] = 0 \), and \( dp[i] \) for \( i > 0 \) is either 1 or \( n + 1 \) depending on the substring condition.**
