The code assigns the value of `i` (which is `n`) to `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is `n`, this means `dp[n]` will be set to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters; `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = n + 1` for all other `i`; `i` is `n`; `j` is `0`; `dp[n]` is `n`**
