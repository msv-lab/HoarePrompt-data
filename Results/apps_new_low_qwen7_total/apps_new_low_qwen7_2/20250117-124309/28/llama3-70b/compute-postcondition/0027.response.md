Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = n + 1` for all other `i`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `0`.
   - `dp[i]` is `n + 1`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Currently, `i` is `n + 1`, so it does not satisfy the condition `i <= n`.
   - To satisfy the condition `i <= n`, `i` needs to be decreased by 1.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` should be set to `n`.
   - `j` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters; `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = n + 1` for all other `i`; `i` is `n`; `j` is `0`; `dp[i]` is `n + 1`**.
