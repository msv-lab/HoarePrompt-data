Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `n`: An integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s`: A string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
   - `dp`: A list of length `n+1`.
   - `i`: Initialized to `n + 1`.
   - `j`: Initialized to `n - 1`.
   - `dp[i]`: Initialized to `n + 1`.

2. **Understand the For Loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `i`.

3. **Initial Values of `i` and `j`:**
   - `i = n + 1`
   - `j = n - 1`

4. **Determine the Condition for the First Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `j < i`.
   - Substituting the initial values, we get `(n - 1) < (n + 1)`.

5. **Verify the Condition:**
   - The condition `(n - 1) < (n + 1)` is always true for any integer `n > 0`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute at least once because `j` will be less than `i` when the loop starts.

6. **State of Objects at the Start of the Loop:**
   - `n` remains the same as initialized.
   - `s` remains the same as initialized.
   - `dp` remains the same as initialized.
   - `i` remains `n + 1` because it is not updated in the loop header.
   - `j` is set to `n - 1` initially and this value is used to check the loop condition.

Since the loop will execute the first time given the initial conditions, we can summarize the required states:

**State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n - 1`**
