Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1` where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If the substring `s[j:i]` is found in the prefix `s[:j]`, then the value of `dp[i]` remains 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i]` remains 1.***
