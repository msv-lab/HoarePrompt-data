State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1` initialized to zeros with `dp[0]` being 0, `i` is 1**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Loop Control Variables**: The loop control variables are `i` and `n`. The loop will start from `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: According to the loop definition, the first iteration of the loop should start with `i = 1`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition `i < n + 1` must be true for the first iteration. Therefore, `i` should be 1, and `n` must be at least 1.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`s` and `dp`) do not directly affect the loop's execution but are part of the overall program state. They are initialized as specified.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the state must be such that `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 100, we only need to ensure `i` is set to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1` initialized to zeros with `dp[0]` being 0, `i` is 1**
