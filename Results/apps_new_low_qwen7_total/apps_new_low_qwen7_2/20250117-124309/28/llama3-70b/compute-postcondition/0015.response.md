The code `dp[i] = i` assigns the value of `i` to `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is `n + 1`, the value of `dp[i]` becomes `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n - 1`; `dp[i]` is `n + 1`**
