Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n+1`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`.
   - Since `i` is `n + 1`, the loop will run for `j` in the range from 0 to `n`.

3. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `i`.

4. **Loop Body Effect**:
   - The loop body checks if the substring `s[j:i]` is found in the prefix `s[:j]`.
   - If it is found, then `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.
   - If it is not found, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

5. **State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n+1`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be decreased by 1 (from `n-1` to `n-2`).
   - `i` remains `n + 1` because it does not change within the loop.

7. **Updated States**:
   - `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s` remains a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
   - `dp` remains a list of length `n+1`.
   - `i` remains `n + 1`.
   - `j` becomes `n - 2`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n - 2`**
