Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `dp` is a list of length `n+1` where:
  - `dp[0]` is 0.
  - `dp[1]` is 1.
  - For `i > 1`, `dp[i]` is updated based on the substring condition.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `n-1`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = n`.
- The current value of `i` is `n`.
- The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Check the Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition `i < n + 1` needs to be true for the next iteration.
   - Currently, `i` is `n`, and `n + 1` is `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i < n + 1` evaluates to `True` when `i` is `n`.

2. **Adjust the State of `i`**:
   - Since the loop condition is true, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Hence, the new value of `i` will be `n + 1`.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `dp` remains unchanged.
   - `j` will be updated to `i - 1` in the loop body, but since we are determining the state before the loop body runs, `j` remains `n - 1`.

### Final State Before the Next Iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (unchanged).
- `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters (unchanged).
- `dp` is a list of length `n+1` (unchanged).
- `i` will be `n + 1` (since it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration).
- `j` remains `n - 1` (since it will be updated in the loop body).

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n - 1`**.
