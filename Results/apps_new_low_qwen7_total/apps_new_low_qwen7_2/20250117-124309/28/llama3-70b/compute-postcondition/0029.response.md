Let's break down the given state and the for loop to determine what must hold true for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = n + 1` for all other `i`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `0`.
- `dp[n]` is `n`.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables Affecting Loop Execution:**
   - The loop is controlled by the variable `j` which ranges from `0` to `i - 1`.
   - The value of `i` is `n`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `j` is initially set to `0`.
   - `i` is set to `n`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j < i`.
   - Since `i` is `n`, the loop will execute as long as `j < n`.

4. **Current State:**
   - `j` is `0`.
   - `i` is `n`.

5. **Verification:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be less than `i`.
   - Since `j` is `0` and `i` is `n`, the condition `j < i` is satisfied because `0 < n` is always true for any positive integer `n`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The only variables that affect the loop execution are `j` and `i`.
   - `j` is currently `0`, and `i` is `n`.

### Final State:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = n + 1` for all other `i` (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `0`.
- `dp[n]` is `n`.

### Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `n`, `j` is `0`**
