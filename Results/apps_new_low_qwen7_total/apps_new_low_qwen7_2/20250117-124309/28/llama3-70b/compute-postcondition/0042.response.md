The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the string, and the second line contains a string `s` consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. 

Based on the provided information, the function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the example. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input, where `n` represents the length of `s`.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input, where `n` represents the length of `s`.**
