Let's analyze the given code and its behavior step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State

The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1` and checks if the substring `s[j:i]` is a substring of `s[:j]`. If it is, `dp[i]` is updated based on the value of `dp[j]`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes

- **Invariants**: 
  - The initial value of `i` is `n`.
  - The initial value of `j` is `0`.
  - The initial value of `dp` is `[0, n+1, n+1, ..., n+1]`.

- **Variables that change**:
  - `dp[i]` can change during each iteration of the loop based on the condition in the `if` statement.
  - `i` and `j` will increment, but the loop's primary effect is on updating `dp[i]`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior

The loop updates `dp[i]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1` if the substring `s[j:i]` is found in `s[:j]`. The term `(i - j) // (i - j - j)` simplifies to `1` since `i - j - j = i - 2j`, and thus `(i - j) // (i - 2j) = 1` as long as `i > j`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships

To understand the final state, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where `dp[i]` is updated in every possible way. This happens when `s[j:i]` is always found in `s[:j]`.

For the initial value of `i = n` and `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1`, the loop will update `dp[n]` to the minimum value of `dp[j] + 1` for all `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

Since `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = n + 1` for all other `i` initially, the smallest possible value for `dp[j] + 1` is `1` (when `j = 0`). Therefore, `dp[n]` will be updated to `1`.

After all iterations, the final state of the variables will be:

- `i` will be `n`.
- `j` will have reached `n-1` (since the loop stops after `j` reaches `i-1`).
- `dp[i]` will be `1`.

### Output State

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, and `dp[i]` is `1`.**
