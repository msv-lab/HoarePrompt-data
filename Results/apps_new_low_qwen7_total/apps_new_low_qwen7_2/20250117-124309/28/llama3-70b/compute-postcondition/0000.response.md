The initial state is defined by the input where `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters. The code initializes a list `dp` with zeros of length `n + 1`, and sets `dp[0]` to 0. However, the code snippet does not provide enough information to determine the final values of `s` or `dp` beyond their initial assignment because no further operations are performed on these variables within the given code block.

Given the code:
```python
n = int(input())
s = input()
dp = [0] * (n + 1)
dp[0] = 0
```

The final state will reflect the following:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) as it is read from the input.
- `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters as it is read from the input.
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to zeros, with `dp[0]` explicitly set to 0.

Since the code does not modify `s` or `dp` further, the final output state remains:
Output State: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), s is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, dp is a list of length n+1 initialized to zeros with dp[0] being 0**
