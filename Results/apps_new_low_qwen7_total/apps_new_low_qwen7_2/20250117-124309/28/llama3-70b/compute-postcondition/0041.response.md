The code snippet `print(dp[n])` simply prints the value of `dp[n]`. Since `dp[n]` was not explicitly modified within the given code snippet, its value remains the same as it was in the initial state. 

The initial state is:
- \( n \) is an integer between 1 and 100.
- \( s \) is a string of \( n \) lowercase Latin letters.
- \( dp[0] = 0 \).
- \( dp[i] \) for \( i > 0 \) is either 1 or \( n + 1 \) depending on the substring condition.

Since no changes are made to `dp[n]`, the value of `dp[n]` remains as it was in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **\( dp[n] \) is either 1 or \( n + 1 \) depending on the substring condition, \( n \) is an integer between 1 and 100, \( s \) is a string of \( n \) lowercase Latin letters.**
