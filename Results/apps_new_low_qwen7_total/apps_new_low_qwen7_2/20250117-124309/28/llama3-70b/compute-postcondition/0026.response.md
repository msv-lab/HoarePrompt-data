Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `dp` is a list of length `n+1`, initialized such that `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = n + 1` for all other `i`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is `n - 1`.

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(i):
    if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
```

### Analysis of the Loop
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to `n + 1` and remains constant throughout the loop since it is not modified inside the loop. Hence, `i` is an invariant.
2. **Variable `j`**: The variable `j` starts at `n - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. So, after `k` iterations, `j` will be `n - k - 1`.
3. **Condition in the Loop**: The condition `s[j:i] in s[:j]` checks if the substring `s[j:i]` is a prefix of `s[:j]`.
4. **Update Rule**: If the substring `s[j:i]` is a prefix of `s[:j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)`. This simplifies to `min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` because `(i - j) // (i - j - j)` is always 1 (as long as `i > j`).

### Iteration Process
- After 1 iteration: `j` becomes `n - 1`, and the loop checks if `s[n-1:n+1]` is in `s[:n-1]`. Since `s[n-1:n+1]` is just one character, this check always fails, so no update happens.
- After 2 iterations: `j` becomes `n - 2`, and the loop checks if `s[n-2:n+1]` is in `s[:n-2]`. Again, this check always fails, so no update happens.
- This process continues until `j` reaches 0. At each iteration, the check always fails because `s[j:i]` is just one character (since `i` is always `n + 1`), and `s[:j]` has fewer characters.

### Final State
Since the condition `s[j:i] in s[:j]` never evaluates to true, `dp[i]` remains unchanged throughout the loop. Therefore, the final value of `dp[i]` will still be `n + 1`.

### Conclusion
The loop does not change the value of `dp[i]` because the substring condition is never met. Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop finishes is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters; `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = n + 1` for all other `i`; `i` is `n + 1`; `j` is `0`; `dp[i]` is `n + 1`.**
