Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

### Initial State
- `n`: An integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `s`: A string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `dp`: A list of length `n+1` where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is 1.
- `i`: Starts as 1.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`:
```python
for j in range(i):
    if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
```
This means that for each `i`, the loop checks if the substring `s[j:i]` is in the prefix `s[:j]`. If it is, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1`.

### Key Observations
1. **Invariant Variables**: The variables `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` are constants and do not change.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will only execute if `i > 1`.
3. **Substring Check**: The substring `s[j:i]` can only be checked if `j < i`, and `s[:j]` should contain the substring.

### Final State After Loop Execution
Since the loop increments `i` and checks substrings up to `n`, let's consider the final state after the loop completes.

- `i` will eventually reach `n`.
- `dp[i]` will be updated based on the condition inside the loop.

Given the conditions and the structure of the problem, we need to ensure that the loop fully runs from `i=1` to `i=n`.

### Output State Calculation
- `n`: Remains as provided (an integer between 1 and 100).
- `s`: Remains as provided (a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters).
- `dp[0]`: Remains 0.
- `dp[1]`: Remains 1.
- `i`: Reaches `n`.
- `j`: Will iterate from 0 to `n-1` within the loop.

Since the loop updates `dp[i]` based on the substring condition, and the loop runs from `i=1` to `i=n`, the final state of `dp` will be fully updated. The exact values of `dp` will depend on the specific string `s` and its substrings.

### Final Output State
- `n`: The same integer between 1 and 100.
- `s`: The same string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `dp`: A list of length `n+1` where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is 1, and `dp[i]` for `i > 1` is updated based on the substring condition.
- `i`: `n`.
- `j`: The last value of `j` will be `n-1`.

Thus, the output state after the loop finishes executing is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1` where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is 1, and `dp[i]` for `i > 1` is updated based on the substring condition, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`.**
