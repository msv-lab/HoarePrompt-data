The code `dp[i] = i` updates the value of `dp[i]` to `i`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `dp` is a list of length `n+1` initialized to zeros with `dp[0]` being 0, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, the value of `dp[1]` will be set to 1. The other values in the `dp` list remain unchanged (still 0), and the values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1` with `dp[0]` being 0 and `dp[1]` being 1, `i` is 1**
