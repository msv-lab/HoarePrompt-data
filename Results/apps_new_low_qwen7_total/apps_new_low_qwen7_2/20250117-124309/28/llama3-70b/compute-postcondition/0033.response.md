Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` as the variable iterating over the range from `0` to `i-1`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < i`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `0`.
   - `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)`.

4. **Update the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0` and `i` is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and checked against `i`.
   - Therefore, `j` should be `1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `i` remains unchanged since it is `n` and does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `n` remains the same, as it was an initial condition and not changed by the loop.
   - `i` remains `n`.
   - `j` changes from `0` to `1`.

6. **Final state before the next iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` must be `1`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `n`, `j` is `1`**.
