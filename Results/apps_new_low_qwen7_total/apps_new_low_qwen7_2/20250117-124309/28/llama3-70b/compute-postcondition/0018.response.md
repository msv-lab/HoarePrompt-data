Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n+1`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.
   - The substring `s[j:i]` is found within the prefix `s[:j]`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
   ```

3. Let's break down the impact of this line of code:
   - `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the expression `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1`.
   - `dp[j]` is already defined in the list `dp`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`, and `j` is `n - 1`.
   - Calculate `(i - j)` which is `(n + 1) - (n - 1) = 2`.
   - Then calculate `(i - j - j)` which is `2 - (n - 1) = 3 - n`.
   - Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `3 - n` will be a negative number (specifically, `-n + 3`).
   - The expression `2 // (-n + 3)` will always evaluate to 0 because dividing a positive number by a negative number results in a negative integer, and integer division rounds towards zero.

4. So, the expression simplifies to `dp[j] + 0 + 1`, which is `dp[j] + 1`.

5. Therefore, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n - 1`, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1).**
