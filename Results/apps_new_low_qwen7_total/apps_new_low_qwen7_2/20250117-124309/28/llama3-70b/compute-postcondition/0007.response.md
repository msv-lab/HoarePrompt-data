Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop in question is:
   ```python
   for j in range(i):
   ```
   The loop variable here is `j`.

2. **Determine the initial values**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `total` is 10
   - `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters
   - `dp` is a list of length `n+1` where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`. Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will run from `j=0` to `j=0`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is running from `j=0` to `j=0`, it means `j` will be incremented to `1` at the start of the next iteration (if there is one).
   - Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to `1`.

5. **Check other variables**:
   - `total` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `dp` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 10, `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1` where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
