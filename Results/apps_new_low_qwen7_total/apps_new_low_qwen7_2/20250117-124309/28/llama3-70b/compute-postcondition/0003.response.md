To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the information provided and analyze the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `dp` is a list of length `n+1` with `dp[0]` being 0 and `dp[1]` being 1.
- `i` is 1.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for j in range(i)` will iterate from `j = 0` to `j < i`.
- Since `i` is initially set to 1, the loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j < 1`, which means it will run exactly once.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute as long as `j < i`.
- Given `i = 1`, the condition `j < i` simplifies to `j < 1`.

### State of Variables in the Loop Head:
- When the loop starts, `j` will be initialized to 0 (since `range(i)` generates values from 0 to `i-1`).
- For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be less than `i`, which is 1.

### Conclusion:
- `j` will be 0 when the loop starts, and since `0 < 1`, the loop will execute the first time.
- There are no other variables or states within the loop head that affect the execution of the loop itself.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 10 (or any value, as it does not affect the loop execution), `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1` with `dp[0]` being 0 and `dp[1]` being 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute the first time as `j` is 0 and `0 < 1`.
