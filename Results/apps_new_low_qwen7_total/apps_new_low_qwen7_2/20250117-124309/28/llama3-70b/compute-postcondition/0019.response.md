Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of length `n+1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n - 1`. If the substring `s[j:i]` is found in the prefix `s[:j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1). Otherwise, no change is made to `dp[i]`.**
