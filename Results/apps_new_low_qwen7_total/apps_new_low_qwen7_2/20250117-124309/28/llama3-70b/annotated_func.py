#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the string. The second line contains a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())

s = input()

dp = [0] * (n + 1)

dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i
        
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: \( n \) is an integer between 1 and 100, \( s \) is a string of \( n \) lowercase Latin letters, \( dp[0] = 0 \), and \( dp[i] \) for \( i > 0 \) is either 1 or \( n + 1 \) depending on the substring condition.
    print(dp[n])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) from the input, where \( n \) represents the length of \( s \). It then computes a dynamic programming array \( dp \) such that \( dp[i] \) is the minimum number of substrings required to partition \( s[0:i] \) into substrings that do not appear before their first occurrence in \( s \). The function prints the value of \( dp[n] \). If no such partitioning is possible, \( dp[n] \) will be \( n + 1 \).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The code contains a logical error in the inner loop condition. Specifically, the denominator in the division operation \((i - j) // (i - j - j)\) can lead to a division by zero when \( i = 2 \) and \( j = 0 \). This should be handled appropriately to avoid runtime errors.
2. The code assumes that \( dp[i] \) will always be updated to either 1 or \( n + 1 \), but this may not be true. The correct value of \( dp[i] \) depends on the substring conditions, and it could be greater than 1 or less than \( n + 1 \) depending on the input string \( s \).
