You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.

Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation:  add a character to the end of the string. 

Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.

For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.

If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

Print the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containing only one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string you have to type. The second line containing the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
abcabca

Output
5

Input
8
abcdefgh

Output
8



-----Note-----

The first test described in the problem statement.

In the second test you can only type all the characters one by one.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
    print(dp[n])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the string. The second line contains a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())

s = input()

dp = [0] * (n + 1)

dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i
        
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: \( n \) is an integer between 1 and 100, \( s \) is a string of \( n \) lowercase Latin letters, \( dp[0] = 0 \), and \( dp[i] \) for \( i > 0 \) is either 1 or \( n + 1 \) depending on the substring condition.
    print(dp[n])



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of operations required to type a given string `s` using two operations: 
     - Add a character to the end of the current string.
     - Copy the entire current string and append it to itself.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The provided solution uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to solve this problem.
   - `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of operations needed to type the first `i` characters of the string `s`.

3. **DP Transition:**
   - For each position `i`, we consider adding a character to the end of the current string, which costs `dp[i] = i`.
   - We also check if any prefix of the substring `s[0:i]` is a suffix of `s[0:j]` where `j < i`. If such a prefix exists, it means we can copy the substring `s[0:j]` and then add the remaining characters. This reduces the cost to `dp[j] + 1` (cost to type the prefix `s[0:j]` and then copy and add the rest).

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The code correctly handles the edge case when `i == j`, meaning no copying is done.

5. **Optimization:**
   - The inner loop iterates from `0` to `i-1`, checking for the longest possible prefix that matches the suffix. This ensures that the minimum number of operations is found.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The final result is stored in `dp[n]`, which gives the minimum number of operations needed to type the entire string.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations needed to type the string using the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
