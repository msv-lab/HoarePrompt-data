Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the inner loop where it attempts to check if a substring `s[j:i]` exists in the prefix `s[:j]`. The expression `(i - j) // (i - j - j)` in the line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)` is incorrect and will result in a division by zero or an incorrect value due to the subtraction of `j` twice. This leads to incorrect calculations of the minimum number of operations needed.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
aaaaaa
```

The correct output should be 4 because you can type 'aaa' and then copy it twice. However, the given program will not handle this case correctly due to the aforementioned logical error, resulting in an incorrect number of operations.
