### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Loop Structure**: 
   - The function initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the starting position at the North Pole.
   - It then iterates through the movements provided in the input.
   
2. **Movement Calculation**:
   - For each movement, the latitude is updated using the conversion factor `111.195` (which approximates the number of kilometers per degree of latitude).
   - The directions "North" and "South" update the latitude accordingly, while "West" and "East" are ignored (as they do not affect the latitude).

3. **Boundary Checks**:
   - The code checks if the current latitude exceeds the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees. If it does, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - It also ensures that if the latitude reaches -90 or 90 degrees, the corresponding direction must be "North" or "South" respectively. If not, it prints "NO" and exits.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After processing all movements, the function checks if the final latitude is exactly 90 degrees. If so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given these points, the logic correctly follows the problem statement and constraints, ensuring that all conditions are met properly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the required checks and correctly determines whether the sequence of movements is valid according to the problem's conditions.
