Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires checking if Limak's journey, starting from the North Pole, ends at the North Pole after following the given instructions. The key constraints are:
   - Limak can only move South if he is currently at the North Pole.
   - Limak can only move North if he is currently at the South Pole.
   - The journey must end on the North Pole.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly initializes `curr_lat` to 90 degrees, representing the North Pole.
   - For each instruction, it updates the latitude based on the direction (`North` or `South`) and distance (`t`).
   - It checks if the current latitude exceeds -90 or 90 degrees, which would mean Limak has moved off the sphere. If so, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - It also ensures that if Limak is at the South Pole (-90 degrees), the next move must be North.
   - If Limak is at the North Pole (90 degrees), the next move must be South.
   - After processing all instructions, it checks if the final latitude is 90 degrees (indicating the North Pole) and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

3. **Verification**:
   - The code logic accurately reflects the problem constraints.
   - It correctly handles the boundary conditions for the poles.
   - It ensures the journey ends at the North Pole.

Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as stated.

Correctness: **True**
