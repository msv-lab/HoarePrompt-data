Reasoning:
1. The function correctly initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the starting point at the North Pole.
2. It processes each movement and updates the latitude based on the distance and direction. For North and South directions, the latitude is updated using the approximate conversion factor from kilometers to degrees (1 degree â‰ˆ 111.195 kilometers).
3. If the latitude goes outside the valid range (-90 to 90 degrees) or if the latitude reaches -90 or 90 with an invalid direction (North from South Pole or South from North Pole), the function immediately prints 'NO' and exits.
4. After processing all movements, the function checks if the final latitude is exactly 90 degrees and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
5. The logic handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement accurately.

Given the above reasoning, the provided function correctly implements the required conditions.

Correctness: **True**
