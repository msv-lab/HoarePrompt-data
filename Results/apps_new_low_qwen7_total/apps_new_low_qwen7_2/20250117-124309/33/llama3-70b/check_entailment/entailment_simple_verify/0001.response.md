### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires checking if Limak's journey, starting from the North Pole, ends at the North Pole after following the given instructions.
   - Key constraints include:
     - Limak can only move South if he is currently at the North Pole.
     - Limak can only move North if he is currently at the South Pole.
     - The journey must end on the North Pole.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly initializes `curr_lat` to 90 degrees, representing the North Pole.
   - For each instruction, it updates the latitude based on the direction (`North` or `South`) and distance (`t`).
   - It checks if the current latitude exceeds -90 or 90 degrees, which would mean Limak has moved off the sphere. If so, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - It also ensures that if Limak is at the South Pole (-90 degrees), the next move must be North.
   - If Limak is at the North Pole (90 degrees), the next move must be South.
   - After processing all instructions, it checks if the final latitude is 90 degrees (indicating the North Pole) and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Initialization and Boundary Checks**:
     - The initialization of `curr_lat` to 90 is correct.
     - The boundary checks ensure that Limak does not exceed the valid range of latitudes.
   - **Direction Constraints**:
     - The code correctly enforces that Limak cannot move North when at the South Pole and cannot move South when at the North Pole.
   - **Final Check**:
     - The final check to see if the latitude is 90 after all movements is correct.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation:

- **The Conversion Factor 111.195**:
  - The code uses a conversion factor of `111.195` to convert distances to latitude changes. This factor is based on the assumption that the Earth's circumference is 40,000 km and the degree of latitude corresponds to approximately 111.195 km. However, this factor is not necessary and incorrect for the problem constraints.
  - The problem states that the length of the equator is 40,000 km, and the length of any meridian is 20,000 km. Therefore, moving 1 degree of latitude should correspond to 20,000 km / 360 â‰ˆ 55.556 km, not 111.195 km.

Since the code uses an incorrect conversion factor, the latitude calculations will be inaccurate. This means that the conditions for movement (e.g., moving only to the South from the North Pole) may not be correctly enforced due to the incorrect conversion.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is not correct because it uses an incorrect conversion factor for converting distances to latitude changes. The journey constraints will not be accurately enforced, leading to incorrect results.

**Final: False**
