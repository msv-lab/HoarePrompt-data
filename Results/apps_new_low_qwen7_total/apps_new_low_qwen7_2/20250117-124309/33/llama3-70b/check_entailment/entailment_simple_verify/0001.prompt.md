You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Drawings below show how Limak's journey would look like in first two samples. In the second sample the answer is "NO" because he doesn't end on the North Pole. [Image]

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. For each i from 1 to n, t_{i} is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, and dir_{i} is one of "North", "South", "West", "East".

    n = int(input())

    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a list of integers, `dir` is a list of strings, `curr_lat` is 90, `n` is the final value of the loop variable.
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires checking if Limak's journey, starting from the North Pole, ends at the North Pole after following the given instructions. The key constraints are:
   - Limak can only move South if he is currently at the North Pole.
   - Limak can only move North if he is currently at the South Pole.
   - The journey must end on the North Pole.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly initializes `curr_lat` to 90 degrees, representing the North Pole.
   - For each instruction, it updates the latitude based on the direction (`North` or `South`) and distance (`t`).
   - It checks if the current latitude exceeds -90 or 90 degrees, which would mean Limak has moved off the sphere. If so, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - It also ensures that if Limak is at the South Pole (-90 degrees), the next move must be North.
   - If Limak is at the North Pole (90 degrees), the next move must be South.
   - After processing all instructions, it checks if the final latitude is 90 degrees (indicating the North Pole) and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

3. **Verification**:
   - The code logic accurately reflects the problem constraints.
   - It correctly handles the boundary conditions for the poles.
   - It ensures the journey ends at the North Pole.

Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as stated.
