Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks the conditions specified in the problem description. It keeps track of the current latitude (`curr_lat`) and updates it based on the movement directions. If at any point, Limak moves to a latitude outside the [-90, 90] range, it prints "NO" immediately. If Limak moves to the South Pole and tries to move South again, it also prints "NO". Similarly, if Limak moves to the North Pole and tries to move North, it again prints "NO". Finally, it checks if the journey ends at the North Pole (latitude 90) and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly. Given these checks, the program correctly handles all the specified conditions and potential edge cases, ensuring it works for every valid input.
