Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the starting position at the North Pole.
   - It correctly reads `n`, the number of movements, and iterates over each movement, handling the input and updating `curr_lat` based on the movement direction.

2. **Directional Movement**:
   - For each "North" movement, `curr_lat` is increased, and for each "South" movement, it is decreased. The conversion factor `111.195` is used to convert degrees to kilometers, which is appropriate for small changes in latitude but not necessary for this problem since we are checking boundary conditions rather than exact positions.
   - Movements in "West" and "East" directions are not handled, which is correct according to the problem statement since Limak cannot move in these directions if he is at the poles.

3. **Boundary Checks**:
   - The program correctly checks if `curr_lat` exceeds the valid range (-90 to 90) and prints "NO" if it does, which ensures Limak does not move beyond the North and South Poles.
   - It also ensures that if Limak is at the South Pole (-90), he can only move North, and if he is at the North Pole (90), he can only move South.

4. **Final Position Check**:
   - After processing all movements, the program checks if `curr_lat` is back at 90, indicating that Limak ends up at the North Pole. If not, it prints "NO".

Given that the logic in the program matches the requirements of the problem, ensuring that Limak follows the rules and ends up at the North Pole, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
