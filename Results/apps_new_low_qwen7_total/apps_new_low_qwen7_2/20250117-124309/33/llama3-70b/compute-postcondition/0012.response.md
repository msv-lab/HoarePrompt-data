Postcondition: **`t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` is the original value. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is updated to its original value plus `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', `dir` remains unchanged and `curr_lat` retains its original value. The current value of `curr_lat` is outside the range [-90, 90]**
