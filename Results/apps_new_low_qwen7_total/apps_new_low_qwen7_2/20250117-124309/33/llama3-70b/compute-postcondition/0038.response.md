The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop, the variables `t`, `dir`, `curr_lat`, and `n` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect any of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` is the original value, `n` is greater than 0**
