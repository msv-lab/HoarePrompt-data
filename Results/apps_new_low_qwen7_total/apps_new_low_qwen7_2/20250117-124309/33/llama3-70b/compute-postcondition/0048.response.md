The code snippet prints 'YES' if `curr_lat` is equal to 90, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Since `curr_lat` is initially set to 90, the condition `curr_lat == 90` evaluates to True. Therefore, 'YES' is printed. However, no variables are modified by this code. The output does not affect the values of `t`, `dir`, `curr_lat`, or `n`.

Output State: **`t` is a list of integers, `dir` is a list of strings, `curr_lat` is 90, printed output is 'YES'**
