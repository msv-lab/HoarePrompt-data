Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` is the original value. If `curr_lat` is outside the range [-90, 90], then `curr_lat` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dir` is a string indicating the direction (either 'North' or 'South'), and `curr_lat` is updated to its original value plus or minus `t / 111.195` depending on the direction.***
