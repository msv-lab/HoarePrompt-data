The provided code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

The first line prints `'NO'` to the console, and the second line terminates the program execution immediately. Given this, the program does not have the opportunity to perform any operations on the variables such as updating `curr_lat` based on the value of `t` and the direction `dir`.

Since the program is terminated without any further processing of the variables, the values of `t`, `dir`, `curr_lat`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is the original value, and n is greater than 0**
