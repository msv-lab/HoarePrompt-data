Output State: **`t` is a list of integers, `dir` is a list of strings, `curr_lat` is 90, `n` is the final value of the loop variable.**

### Analysis Breakdown:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The initial state has `n` as an integer between 1 and 50, and `curr_lat` set to 90.
   - The loop iterates `n` times, processing inputs in each iteration.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `curr_lat` starts at 90 and can change based on the direction (`dir`) provided in each iteration.
   - `t` and `dir` are updated in each iteration but their values are stored in lists outside the loop.
   - `n` is the number of iterations and does not change within the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - Each iteration of the loop updates `curr_lat` based on the direction (`dir`), where `t` is divided by 111.195.
   - The loop ensures `curr_lat` stays within the valid latitude range [-90, 90]. If it goes out of bounds, the program prints 'NO' and exits.
   - The loop also checks if `curr_lat` reaches either extreme (-90 or 90) only when the corresponding direction ('North' or 'South') is provided.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `n` will be the final value of the loop counter.
   - `curr_lat` will be the cumulative effect of all movements described by `t` and `dir`.
   - `t` and `dir` are stored as lists of inputs received in each iteration.
   - `curr_lat` will not exceed the range [-90, 90] due to the loop's validation logic.

Given the above analysis, the final output state of the program after the loop has executed all iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is a list of integers, `dir` is a list of strings, `curr_lat` is 90, `n` is the final value of the loop variable.**
