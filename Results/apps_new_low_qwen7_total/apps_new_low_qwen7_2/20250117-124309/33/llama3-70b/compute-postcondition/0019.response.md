Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is 90**

Explanation:
- The first line `print('NO')` simply prints "NO" to the console but does not modify any variables.
- The second line `exit()` terminates the program immediately without running any further code. This means no changes are made to the variables `t`, `dir`, or `curr_lat`.
- Given the initial condition that if `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', then `curr_lat` remains 90, and since `exit()` is called, this condition is not checked. Therefore, the values of `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged from their initial states.
