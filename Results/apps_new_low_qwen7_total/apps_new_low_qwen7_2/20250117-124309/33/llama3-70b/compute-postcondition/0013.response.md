The provided code snippet contains two lines that both attempt to execute commands that would modify the state (print and exit), but these lines are not reachable given the initial conditions and the structure of the code. Specifically, the initial state includes the condition that `curr_lat` is outside the range [-90, 90], which means the `if` statement's conditions ('North' or 'South') cannot be met because changing `curr_lat` would bring it within that range. Therefore, the print and exit statements are never executed due to the unreachable code scenario described by the initial state condition.

Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is the original value outside the range [-90, 90]**
