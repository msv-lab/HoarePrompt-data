State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` is the original value. If `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', then `curr_lat` remains 90. Otherwise, `curr_lat` retains its original value.

To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration, let's break down the loop head:

1. The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, meaning it does not rely on the value of the iterator itself.
2. The only variables directly modified or referenced within the loop head are `curr_lat`.

Given that the loop runs for `n` iterations, whether the loop can execute again depends solely on the value of `n` and whether it is greater than the current iteration count.

Since the loop body is omitted, the only state change that could occur is potentially with `curr_lat`. However, based on the given condition, `curr_lat` would only change if it was originally 90 and `dir` is not 'South'. If this condition is not met, `curr_lat` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current number of iterations. Assuming this is the first iteration, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `t` remains an integer.
- `dir` remains a string.
- `curr_lat` remains the original value unless the condition (curr_lat is 90 and dir is not 'South') is met, in which case it would remain 90.

However, since we are starting the loop, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that the loop can run at least one more time, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` is the original value, `n` must be greater than 1**
