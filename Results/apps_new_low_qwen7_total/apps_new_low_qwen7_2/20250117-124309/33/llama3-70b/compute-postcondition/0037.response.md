The value of `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. Since `t` is an integer, `t / 111.195` results in a floating-point number. The values of `dir` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer; `dir` is a string; `curr_lat` is the original value minus `t / 111.195`; `n` is greater than 0**
