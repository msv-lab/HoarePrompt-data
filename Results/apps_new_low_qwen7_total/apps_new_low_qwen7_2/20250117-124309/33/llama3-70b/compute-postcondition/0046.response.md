Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` is the original value, and `n` is greater than 0. If `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', `curr_lat` is updated to the original value plus `t / 111.195` if `dir` is 'North'. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is updated to the original value minus `t / 111.195'. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', `curr_lat` remains unchanged.***
