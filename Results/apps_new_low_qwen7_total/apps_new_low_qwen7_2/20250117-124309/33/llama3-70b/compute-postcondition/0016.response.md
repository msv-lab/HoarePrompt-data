The provided code block contains two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

These lines do not modify any of the existing variables (`t`, `dir`, `curr_lat`). Instead, they print 'NO' and terminate the program immediately without allowing any further execution of subsequent lines. Given that the initial state of `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', these conditions remain unchanged because the code does not attempt to alter them.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:
Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is -90**
