Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is the original value**

Explanation:
The given code consists of two lines:
1. `print('NO')`: This line prints 'NO' to the console but does not affect any variables.
2. `exit()`: This line terminates the program immediately without changing any variables or performing any further actions.

Since the code execution stops at `exit()`, no further modifications to variables occur. Therefore, the values of `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged from their initial states as described in the precondition.
