`curr_lat` is incremented by `t / 111.195`. The value of `t` is an integer, but its specific value is not given, so `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. The variable `dir` remains unchanged as it was previously set to 'North'. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is its original value plus `t / 111.195`**
