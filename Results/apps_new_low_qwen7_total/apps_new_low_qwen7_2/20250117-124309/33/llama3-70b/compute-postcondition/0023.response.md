`curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. The value of `t` is the integer input, which means `curr_lat` will be updated by adding `int(input()) / 111.195`. The variables `dir`, `n`, and the initial value of `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the integer value of the first input, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` is the original value plus `t / 111.195`, `n` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first input, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` is the original value plus `t / 111.195`, `n` is greater than 1**
