The given code snippet reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of iterations. It then initializes `curr_lat` to 90. However, the code snippet is incomplete as it does not include the logic to update `curr_lat` based on the direction and distance (`t_i`) for each iteration. Without this logic, we can only determine the initial value of `curr_lat` and confirm that `n` is set to the input integer.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\) and `curr_lat` is initialized to 90, and considering that no further operations are specified to modify `curr_lat`, the final output state will remain as follows:

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, curr_lat is 90**
