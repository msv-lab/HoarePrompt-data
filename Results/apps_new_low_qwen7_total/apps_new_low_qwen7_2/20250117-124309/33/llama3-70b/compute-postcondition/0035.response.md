The first line of the code takes input from the user and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `t` and the second part to `dir`. The second line converts `t` from a string to an integer. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer (let's denote its original value as `original_t`)
- `dir` is a string (let's denote its original value as `original_dir`)
- `curr_lat` is the original value (not affected by the code)
- `n` must be greater than 0 (not affected by the code)

After running the code block:
- `t` is now an integer (previously denoted as `original_t`), but its new value is explicitly converted from the input string.
- `dir` is now a string (previously denoted as `original_dir`), but its new value is explicitly set from the second part of the input string.
- `curr_lat` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not involved in the operations.

Since the specific values of `original_t` and `original_dir` were not provided, we will represent them as `original_t` and `original_dir` in the final state.

Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is the original value, n is greater than 0**
