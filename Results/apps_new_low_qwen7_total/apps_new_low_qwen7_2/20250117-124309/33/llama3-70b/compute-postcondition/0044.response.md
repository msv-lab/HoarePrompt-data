Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` is the original value, and `n` is greater than 0. If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the function does nothing. Otherwise, depending on the direction (`dir`), `curr_lat` is updated accordingly: if `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is updated to the original value plus `t / 111.195`; if `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is updated to the original value minus `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', `curr_lat` remains unchanged.***
