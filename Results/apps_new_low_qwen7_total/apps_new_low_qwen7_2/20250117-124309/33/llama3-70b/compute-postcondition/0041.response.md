The provided code consists of two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

These lines do not modify any of the variables (`t`, `dir`, `curr_lat`, or `n`) mentioned in the initial state. The `print('NO')` statement simply prints "NO" to the console, and the `exit()` function terminates the program execution immediately after printing "NO". Therefore, no further state updates occur after these lines are executed.

Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is the original value, and n is greater than 0**
