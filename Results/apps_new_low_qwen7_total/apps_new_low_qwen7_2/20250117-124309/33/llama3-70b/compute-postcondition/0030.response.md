Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is the original value**

Explanation: The provided code snippet consists of two lines. The first line prints 'NO' and the second line calls the `exit()` function, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, none of the variables (`t`, `dir`, or `curr_lat`) are updated or affected by the code. The values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the final output state retains the original values of `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` within the specified range for `curr_lat`.
