Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is the original value, n is greater than 0**

Explanation:
The provided code consists of two lines:
1. `print('NO')`: This line prints 'NO' to the console but does not modify any variables.
2. `exit()`: This line terminates the program immediately without modifying any variables.

Since both lines do not change any of the existing variables (`t`, `dir`, `curr_lat`, or `n`), the final state remains the same as the initial state. The value of `curr_lat` is unchanged based on the conditions provided in the precondition.
