`curr_lat` is incremented by `t / 111.195`. The value of `t` is an integer, so `t / 111.195` results in a floating-point number. The values of `dir`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` is the original value plus `t / 111.195`, `n` is greater than 0**
