Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is typically used when the loop counter is not needed. However, it still needs to check the condition to continue the loop. The relevant variables here are `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer
   - `dir` is a string
   - `curr_lat` is the original value
   - If `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', the function does nothing. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop only depends on `n` for its continuation, and no other variables are mentioned as needing adjustment within the loop head, the only state that needs to be checked and possibly adjusted is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `n` must be greater than 0.

**State: **`t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` is the original value, `n` must be greater than 0**.
