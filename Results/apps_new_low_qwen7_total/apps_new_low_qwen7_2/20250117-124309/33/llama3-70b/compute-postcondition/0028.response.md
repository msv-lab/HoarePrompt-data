The given code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

Let's analyze the impact of these lines on the initial state:

- The first line prints "NO" to the console.
- The second line exits the program immediately after printing "NO".

Since the program exits right after printing "NO", none of the variables (`t`, `dir`, or `curr_lat`) are modified by the code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.

Given the initial state where:
- `t` is an integer,
- `dir` is a string,
- `curr_lat` is the original value (based on the context provided before the code snippet).

The final output state is the same as the initial state because no modifications occur due to the execution of the provided code.

Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is the original value**
