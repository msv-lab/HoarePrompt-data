The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems that the function should be able to handle a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: an integer `n`, an integer `t_i`, and a string `dir_i`. The function should validate the constraints for `n` and `t_i`, and `dir_i` should be one of the specified directions.

Given the output cases are not explicitly stated, we will assume the function processes the input according to the constraints and returns a specific value based on the validation or some other logic. Since no specific return values are given, we'll describe the function's expected behavior in terms of its parameters and constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n`, an integer `t_i`, and a string `dir_i`. It validates that `n` is between 1 and 50, and `t_i` is between 1 and 10^6, and `dir_i` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East". Based on the validation, it returns a specific value (the nature of which is not detailed in the provided information).**
