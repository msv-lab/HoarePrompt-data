The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables outside of the loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables `t`, `dir`, `curr_lat`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (updated to the integer value of the first input), `dir` is a string, `curr_lat` is the original value, `n` is greater than 1**
