The function processes a series of movements (North, South, East, West) represented by distances and directions. Each movement updates the latitude (`curr_lat`), which starts at 90 degrees. If at any point the latitude goes out of the valid range (-90 to 90 degrees), or if the latitude reaches the extreme values (-90 or 90) with an invalid direction, the function prints 'NO' and exits. After processing all movements, if the final latitude is exactly 90 degrees, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This function ensures that the final latitude remains within the valid geographical range and correctly handles all possible edge cases.
