The function `can_distribute` accepts an integer `x` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of the integer division of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. Here, `a` represents the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` represents the number of pieces of the second cake, and `n` represents the number of plates. The function checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces of the two cakes among `n` plates such that each plate gets at least one piece from each cake. If the sum of `(a // x) + (b // x)` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This check covers all potential cases where `a`, `b`, and `n` are within the given constraints (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b).
