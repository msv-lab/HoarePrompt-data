    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `high` is \(\max(a, b) + 1\), and `mid` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\min(a, b) + \max(a, b)}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
    return low - 1
    #`The program returns low - 1 where low is min(a, b) + 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are integers with specific constraints. The function performs a binary search to find the smallest integer `x` (where \(2 \leq x \leq a + b\)) such that `can_distribute(x)` returns `True`. If no such `x` exists, the function returns `min(a, b)`. The function returns `low - 1` where `low` is the value determined by the binary search, which is `min(a, b) + 1` if `can_distribute(min(a, b) + 1)` returns `False`. This means the function effectively finds the smallest integer `x` within the specified range that meets the condition imposed by `can_distribute`, or returns `min(a, b)` if no such integer exists.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, and n is an integer representing the number of plates such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #`The program returns the result of (a // x) + (b // x) which is greater than or equal to n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_distribute` accepts an integer `x` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of the integer division of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. Here, `a` represents the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` represents the number of pieces of the second cake, and `n` represents the number of plates. The function checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces of the two cakes among `n` plates such that each plate gets at least one piece from each cake. If the sum of `(a // x) + (b // x)` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This check covers all potential cases where `a`, `b`, and `n` are within the given constraints (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b).
