Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is 1, `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\), and the function `can_distribute(mid)` evaluates to `True`***
