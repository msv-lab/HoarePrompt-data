The function `can_distribute` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` is derived from the integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is the number of pieces of the second cake, and `n` is the number of plates. The function returns the result of `(a // x) + (b // x)` which is greater than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_distribute` is to accept an integer `x` and return `(a // x) + (b // x)` if the result is greater than or equal to `n`.
