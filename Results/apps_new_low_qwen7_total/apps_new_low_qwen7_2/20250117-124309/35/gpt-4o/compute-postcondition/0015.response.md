The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. Given the initial state where `low` and `high` are unchanged if `can_distribute(mid)` returns false, and otherwise they are updated to ensure `low < high` holds true; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the value of `mid` remains unchanged, but `low` is now updated.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
