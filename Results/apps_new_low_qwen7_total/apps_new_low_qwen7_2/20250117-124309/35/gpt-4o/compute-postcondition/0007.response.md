Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\). If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, then `low` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1\) and `high` remains \(\min(a, b) + 1\). Otherwise, `low` remains 1 and `high` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\).***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
