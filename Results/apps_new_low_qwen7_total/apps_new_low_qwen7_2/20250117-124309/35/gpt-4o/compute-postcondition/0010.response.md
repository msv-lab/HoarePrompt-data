The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. From the initial state, we know that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`. Substituting this into the new assignment for `low`, we get `low = (low + high) // 2 + 1`. The values of `high` and `mid` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is unchanged.
Output State: **`low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is unchanged**
