The code `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to be equal to the current value of `mid`. Based on the initial state, `low` and `high` are unchanged if `can_distribute(mid)` returns false, and they are updated to ensure `low < high` holds true if `can_distribute(mid)` returns true. The value of `mid` remains `(low + high) // 2`.

Since the code only changes the value of `high` to `mid`, and no other changes occur to `low` or `can_distribute(mid)` (which is not executed here), the condition `low < high` still holds true because the only change is setting `high` to `mid`. Therefore, the precondition that `low` and `high` are updated to ensure `low < high` still applies.

Output State: **`low` and `high` are unchanged if `can_distribute(mid)` returns false, otherwise they are updated to ensure `low < high` holds true; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is now equal to `mid`.**
