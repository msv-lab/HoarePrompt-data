Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low < high`.
2. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**: The loop condition depends on the variables `low` and `high`.
3. **Understand the modifications to `low` and `high` based on the function call `can_distribute(mid)`**:
   - If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, then `low` becomes \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1\) and `high` remains \(\min(a, b) + 1\).
   - If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`, then `low` remains 1 and `high` becomes \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\).

Given that the loop continues as long as `low < high`, we need to ensure that `low < high` holds true for the next iteration.

### Case Analysis:

#### Case 1: `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`
- New `low` = \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1\)
- New `high` = \(\min(a, b) + 1\)

Since \(\min(a, b) + 1 > (\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1\) (because \(\min(a, b) + 1 > \frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\)), the condition `low < high` still holds true.

#### Case 2: `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`
- New `low` = 1
- New `high` = \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\)

For the condition `low < high` to hold true, \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 > 1\), which is always true since \(\min(a, b) \geq 1\).

### Conclusion:
In both cases, the condition `low < high` will hold true for the next iteration. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary to the current values of `low` and `high`.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1` if `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, otherwise `low` is 1, `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1` if `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, otherwise `high` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\)**.
