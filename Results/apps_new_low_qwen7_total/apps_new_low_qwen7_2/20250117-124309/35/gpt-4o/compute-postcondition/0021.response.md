Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are integers with specific constraints. The function performs a binary search to find the smallest integer `x` (where \(2 \leq x \leq a + b\)) such that `can_distribute(x)` returns `True`. If no such `x` exists, the function returns `min(a, b)`. The function returns `low - 1` where `low` is the value determined by the binary search, which is `min(a, b) + 1` if `can_distribute(min(a, b) + 1)` returns `False`. This means the function effectively finds the smallest integer `x` within the specified range that meets the condition imposed by `can_distribute`, or returns `min(a, b)` if no such integer exists.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `can_distribute(2)` returns `True`, the function will return `3`.
- If `can_distribute(min(a, b) + 1)` returns `False`, the function will return `min(a, b)`, indicating that no valid integer within the specified range exists.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes the existence of a `can_distribute` function, which is not defined in the provided code. This function is crucial for determining whether a given integer meets the condition. Without its definition, the exact behavior of the binary search cannot be fully determined.
