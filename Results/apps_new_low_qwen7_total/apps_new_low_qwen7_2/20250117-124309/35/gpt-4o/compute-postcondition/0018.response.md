Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `high` is \(\max(a, b) + 1\), and `mid` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\min(a, b) + \max(a, b)}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\).**

### Analysis

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low < high`.
   - `low` starts at 1.
   - `high` starts at \(\min(a, b) + 1\).

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `low` and `high` are updated within the loop based on the return value of `can_distribute(mid)`.
   - `mid` is calculated as \((low + high) // 2\).
   - `can_distribute(mid)` is a function that determines whether a certain condition holds for `mid`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will eventually terminate when `low` equals `high`, indicating that the smallest integer `k` has been found such that `can_distribute(k)` is `False` but `can_distribute(k-1)` is `True`.
   - The final values of `low` and `high` will be the same and will represent this boundary value `k`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - Since `low` and `high` converge, their final values will be the same, say `k`.
   - `low` and `high` will both be set to \( \min(a, b) + 1 \) if the loop never updates them, which is impossible because the loop always updates either `low` or `high` until they meet.
   - Given the range constraints and the behavior of `low` and `high`, the final values of `low` and `high` will be adjusted to the smallest value `k` where `can_distribute(k)` fails.

5. **Final Values**:
   - `n` remains within the range \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\).
   - `a` and `b` remain within their respective ranges.
   - `low` and `high` will both be \(\min(a, b) + 1\) when the loop terminates.
   - `mid` will be \(\left\lfloor \frac{\min(a, b) + \max(a, b)}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\) at the point of termination.

Thus, the final state of the variables is as described above.
