Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is correctly initialized with `low` set to 1 and `high` set to `min(a, b) + 1`. This ensures that we are searching within the valid range for the number of pieces per plate (`x`).

2. **Binary Search Loop**: The while loop correctly performs a binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x` such that each plate contains at least `x` pieces of cake. The condition `if can_distribute(mid):` checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate has at least `mid` pieces. If true, it means `x` can be larger, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Binary Search Termination**: The loop terminates when `low` equals `high`, and the final value of `low - 1` is returned, which represents the maximum possible number `x`.

4. **Helper Function `can_distribute`**: The helper function `can_distribute(x)` correctly checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate has at least `x` pieces. It does this by ensuring that the total number of pieces divided by `x` (integer division) from both cakes is at least equal to the number of plates `n`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program appears to correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate contains at least `x` pieces of cake.

Correctness: **True**
