You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n



- Annotated Code: 
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `high` is \(\max(a, b) + 1\), and `mid` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\min(a, b) + \max(a, b)}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
    return low - 1
    #`The program returns low - 1 where low is min(a, b) + 1`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, and n is an integer representing the number of plates such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #`The program returns the result of (a // x) + (b // x) which is greater than or equal to n`




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic of the two functions `func_1` and `can_distribute`.

1. **Binary Search (`func_1`)**:
   - The function performs a binary search to find the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake.
   - It sets the initial bounds for the binary search as `(low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)`, which is reasonable because the minimum possible value of `x` is 1, and the maximum possible value of `x` is the smaller of `a` and `b` (since the distribution must fit within these values).
   - The loop continues until `low` equals `high`, and in each iteration, it checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes with at least `mid` pieces per plate using the `can_distribute` function.
   - If it is possible, it means the current `mid` could be a potential solution, so it moves the lower bound `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - If it is not possible, it means `mid` is too large, so it moves the upper bound `high` to `mid`.
   - Finally, it returns `low - 1` as the answer, which is the largest possible value of `x`.

2. **Distribution Check (`can_distribute`)**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate has at least `x` pieces.
   - It calculates the total number of plates needed if each plate had at least `x` pieces from both cakes combined: `a // x + b // x`.
   - If this sum is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given the logic of these functions, they correctly implement the binary search algorithm to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions. The `can_distribute` function accurately checks whether a given `x` can be distributed among the plates without violating any constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
