You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n



- Annotated Code: 
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `high` is \(\max(a, b) + 1\), and `mid` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\min(a, b) + \max(a, b)}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
    return low - 1
    #`The program returns low - 1 where low is min(a, b) + 1`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, and n is an integer representing the number of plates such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #`The program returns the result of (a // x) + (b // x) which is greater than or equal to n`




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` cannot be evenly distributed among the plates to meet the requirement that each plate contains at least the minimum number of pieces. Specifically, the program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum possible number of pieces per plate (`x`). However, the binary search implementation does not correctly account for the distribution constraints.

For instance, consider the input `n = 3`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`. According to the problem description, the maximum possible number of pieces per plate (`x`) should be 1 because it is not possible to distribute the pieces such that each plate gets at least 2 pieces (since `2 + 3 = 5` and `5 / 3` is less than 2). However, the program incorrectly returns `2` as the result, which violates the condition that each plate must contain at least `x` pieces.

Here’s why the program fails:
- The binary search is not correctly adjusted to ensure that the sum of pieces divided by `x` is always greater than or equal to `n`.
- The `can_distribute` function only checks if the sum of pieces divided by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`, but it does not ensure that the distribution is valid under the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it fails to meet the requirements in certain cases.
