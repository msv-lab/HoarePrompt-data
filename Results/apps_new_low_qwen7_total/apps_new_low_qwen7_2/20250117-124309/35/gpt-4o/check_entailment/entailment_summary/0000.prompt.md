 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are integers with specific constraints. The function performs a binary search to find the smallest integer `x` (where \(2 \leq x \leq a + b\)) such that `can_distribute(x)` returns `True`. If no such `x` exists, the function returns `min(a, b)`. The function returns `low - 1` where `low` is the value determined by the binary search, which is `min(a, b) + 1` if `can_distribute(min(a, b) + 1)` returns `False`. This means the function effectively finds the smallest integer `x` within the specified range that meets the condition imposed by `can_distribute`, or returns `min(a, b)` if no such integer exists.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `can_distribute` accepts an integer `x` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of the integer division of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. Here, `a` represents the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` represents the number of pieces of the second cake, and `n` represents the number of plates. The function checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces of the two cakes among `n` plates such that each plate gets at least one piece from each cake. If the sum of `(a // x) + (b // x)` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This check covers all potential cases where `a`, `b`, and `n` are within the given constraints (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b).
