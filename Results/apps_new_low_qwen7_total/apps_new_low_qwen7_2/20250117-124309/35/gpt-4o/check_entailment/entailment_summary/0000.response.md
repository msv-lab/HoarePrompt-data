### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that all functions together correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to distribute pieces of two cakes (a and b pieces) onto n plates.
   - Each plate must contain at least one piece from each cake.
   - We want to maximize the minimum number of pieces per plate.

2. **Binary Search Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a binary search approach to find the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate can have at least `x` pieces of cake.
   - It uses the `can_distribute` function to check if a given `x` is feasible.
   - The binary search effectively narrows down the range of possible values for `x` until it finds the optimal value.

3. **Feasibility Check Function (`can_distribute`)**:
   - The function `can_distribute` checks if distributing the pieces of the cakes such that each plate has at least `x` pieces is possible.
   - It calculates the total number of pieces each plate would get by dividing `a` and `b` by `x` and ensuring the sum is at least `n`.

Given the provided execution summaries and the logic of the functions:

- `func_1` correctly uses binary search to find the maximum possible `x`.
- `can_distribute` correctly checks the feasibility of distributing the pieces with a given `x`.

Since both functions work together logically to solve the problem and adhere to the constraints and requirements, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
