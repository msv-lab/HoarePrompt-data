### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic of the two functions `func_1` and `can_distribute`.

1. **Binary Search (`func_1`)**:
   - The function performs a binary search to find the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake.
   - It sets the initial bounds for the binary search as `(low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)`, which is reasonable because the minimum possible value of `x` is 1, and the maximum possible value of `x` is the smaller of `a` and `b` (since the distribution must fit within these values).
   - The loop continues until `low` equals `high`, and in each iteration, it checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes with at least `mid` pieces per plate using the `can_distribute` function.
   - If it is possible, it means the current `mid` could be a potential solution, so it moves the lower bound `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - If it is not possible, it means `mid` is too large, so it moves the upper bound `high` to `mid`.
   - Finally, it returns `low - 1` as the answer, which is the largest possible value of `x`.

2. **Distribution Check (`can_distribute`)**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate has at least `x` pieces.
   - It calculates the total number of plates needed if each plate had at least `x` pieces from both cakes combined: `a // x + b // x`.
   - If this sum is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given the logic of these functions, they correctly implement the binary search algorithm to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions. The `can_distribute` function accurately checks whether a given `x` can be distributed among the plates without violating any constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
