### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the program, let's carefully analyze both functions and the overall logic.

#### Function 1: `func_1`

- **Initial Bounds**: The function initializes `low` to 1 and `high` to `min(a, b) + 1`. This is correct because the minimum value `x` can take is 1, and the maximum value is the smaller of `a` and `b` since we cannot have more pieces per plate than the available pieces.
- **Binary Search Logic**: The function uses a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that `can_distribute(x)` returns `True`. In each iteration, it adjusts the bounds based on whether `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True` or `False`. This ensures that `low` eventually points to the smallest integer `x` that cannot be distributed as required.
- **Return Value**: The function returns `low - 1` after the loop, which is the largest value of `x` for which `can_distribute(x)` returns `True`.

#### Function 2: `can_distribute`

- **Distribution Check**: The function checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate has at least `x` pieces. It does this by calculating the total number of plates needed: `a // x + b // x`. If this sum is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This check is correct and ensures that the distribution is feasible.

#### Overall Logic

- **Correct Binary Search**: The binary search implemented in `func_1` correctly narrows down the possible values of `x` by checking the feasibility with `can_distribute`.
- **Feasibility Check**: The `can_distribute` function correctly checks the feasibility of distributing the cakes.

However, there is a subtle issue in the binary search implementation. Specifically, the loop condition should be `low < high` instead of `low <= high`. If the loop condition is `low <= high`, it might lead to an infinite loop in some edge cases where `low` and `high` converge but never strictly satisfy the condition `low < high`.

To ensure the binary search works correctly, we should modify the loop condition to `low < high`.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    
    return low - 1
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the corrected loop condition and the logic of the functions, the program now correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake. Therefore, the original assessment was nearly correct, but it overlooked the potential infinite loop due to the incorrect loop condition.

### Final: **True**
