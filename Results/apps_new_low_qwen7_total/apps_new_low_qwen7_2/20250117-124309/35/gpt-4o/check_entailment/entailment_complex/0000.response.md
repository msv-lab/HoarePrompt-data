Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and Requirements**:
   - We need to maximize the minimum number of pieces of cake on any plate (`x`).
   - The total number of pieces of cake is `a + b`.
   - There are `n` plates, and each plate must have at least one piece of cake.
   - Pieces of cake from different cakes cannot be mixed on the same plate.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x` such that `can_distribute(x)` returns `True`.
     - It initializes `low` to 1 and `high` to `min(a, b) + 1` (since each cake needs at least one plate).
     - In the binary search, it checks if `can_distribute(mid)` is true. If true, it tries to increase `x` (by setting `low` to `mid + 1`). If false, it decreases `x` (by setting `high` to `mid`).
     - Finally, it returns `low - 1`, which is the largest `x` that satisfies the distribution requirement.
   - **Function `can_distribute(x)`**:
     - This function checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces of cake such that each plate gets at least `x` pieces.
     - It returns `True` if `(a // x) + (b // x) >= n`, meaning the total number of pieces divided by `x` should be enough to cover all `n` plates with at least one piece per plate from each cake.
   
3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` correctly identifies the maximum possible `x` that satisfies the distribution requirements.
   - The `can_distribute` function accurately checks if the current `x` can satisfy the conditions.
   - Given the constraints and the nature of the binary search, the solution correctly determines the maximum `x` that can be distributed across the plates without violating the conditions.

Given this analysis, the program meets the problem requirements and correctly computes the maximum possible number `x`.

Correctness: **True**
