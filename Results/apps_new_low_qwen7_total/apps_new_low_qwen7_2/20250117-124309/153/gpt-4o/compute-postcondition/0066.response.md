The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. In this case, since there is no indication of being inside a loop or if statement, the variables retain their initial states. 

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 0, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[2]`, and `d[j]` is greater than `remaining_manapoints`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
