Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `k` is the number of times the loop executed, `min_time` is the minimum value of `time_with_both_spells` calculated during the loop, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[0]` minus the sum of `b[i]` used during the loop, and `k` is the number of iterations the loop completed before breaking.***
