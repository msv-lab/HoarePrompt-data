Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `min_time` might have been updated, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[i])`, and `time_with_spell` is `remaining_potions * x` if `d[i] <= s`. If `d[i] > s`, the values of `i`, `k`, `min_time`, `remaining_potions`, and `time_with_spell` remain unchanged from their preconditions.***
