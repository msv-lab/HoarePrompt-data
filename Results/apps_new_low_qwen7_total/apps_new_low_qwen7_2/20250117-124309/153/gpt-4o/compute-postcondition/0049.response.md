Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `min_time` is the minimum value between its initial value and either `(max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i])` if `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, or the minimum value of `time_with_both_spells` calculated during the loop if `d[j]` is greater than `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`, and `s` is unchanged.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts, ensuring that all possible outcomes are accounted for after the execution of the if-else block.
