Postcondition: ***`i` is `k + 2`, `k` is the total number of iterations the loop completed, `min_time` is the minimum value between its initial value and `(max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i])` if `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints` for each `j` from `0` to `k-1`, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`. If `b[i] <= s`, `i` is set to 2 and `remaining_manapoints` is updated to `s - b[2]`. Otherwise, `i` remains as `k + 2` and `remaining_manapoints` remains unchanged.***
