Postcondition: ***`i` is `k + 1`, `k` is the total number of iterations the loop completed, `min_time` is the minimum value between its initial value and `(max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i])` if `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints` for each `j` from `0` to `k-1`, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`, and `s`, `n`, `c`, `a`, `d`, and `b` are unchanged.***
