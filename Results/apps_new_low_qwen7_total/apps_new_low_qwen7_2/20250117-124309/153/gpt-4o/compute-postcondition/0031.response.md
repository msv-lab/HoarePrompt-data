Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `min_time` remains unchanged, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is calculated based on `n - c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the old `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, `d[j]` is greater than `remaining_manapoints`.***
