Postcondition: **`d[j]`, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, and `min_time` are as follows: If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `remaining_potions` is calculated as `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to be the minimum of itself and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
