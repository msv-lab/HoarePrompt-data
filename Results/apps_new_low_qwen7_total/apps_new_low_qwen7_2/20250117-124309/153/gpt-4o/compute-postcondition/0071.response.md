Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[2]`. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, the following happens: `remaining_potions` is set to 0, `time_with_both_spells` is set to 0, and `min_time` remains unchanged. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
