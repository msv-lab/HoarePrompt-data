Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `k - 1`, `min_time` is the minimum value between its initial value and `(max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i])` if `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, or the minimum value of `time_with_both_spells` calculated during the loop if `d[j]` is greater than `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`, `n`, `c`, `a`, `d`, `s`, and `b` are unchanged, and `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[j])`, and `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`. After the if-else block, we either consider the case where `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints` or the case where `d[j]` is greater than `remaining_manapoints`.***
