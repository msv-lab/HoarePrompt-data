Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[2]`. If `d[j]` (which is `d[2]`) is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `remaining_potions` is set to `max(0, n - 3)`, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * 4`, and `min_time` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
