The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `d[j_end + 1]`, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, and `min_time`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`d[j_end + 1]` is as before, `remaining_manapoints` is as before, `remaining_potions` is as before, `time_with_both_spells` is as before, `min_time` is as before and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
