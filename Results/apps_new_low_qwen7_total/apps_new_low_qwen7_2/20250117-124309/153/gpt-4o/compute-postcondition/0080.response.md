The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: A non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `m`: A non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k`: A non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `x`: A positive integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `s`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `a`: A list of `m` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i < x\).
- `b`: A list of `m` positive integers such that \(1 \leq b_i \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `c`: A list of `k` positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and `c` is non-decreasing.
- `d`: A list of `k` positive integers such that \(1 \leq d_i \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and `d` is non-decreasing.

The function returns `min_time`, which is the minimum value between its initial value and \(\max(0, n - c[j]) \cdot a[i]\) for all valid pairs \((i, j)\) where \(d[j] \leq \text{remaining\_manapoints}\), and `remaining_manapoints` is \(s - b[m-1]\).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, x, s, a, b, c, and d, and returns min_time which is the minimum value between its initial value and \(\max(0, n - c[j]) \cdot a[i]\) for all valid pairs (i, j) where \(d[j] \leq \text{remaining\_manapoints}\), with remaining_manapoints being \(s - b[m-1]\).**
