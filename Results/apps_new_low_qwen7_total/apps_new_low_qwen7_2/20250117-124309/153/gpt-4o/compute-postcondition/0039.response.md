Postcondition: **`d[j_end + 1]`, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, and `min_time` remain unchanged. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is updated to `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is updated to `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to be the minimum of itself and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, the loops or if statements are exited without any changes to these variables.**
