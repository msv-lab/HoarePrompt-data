You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Anton is playing a very interesting computer game, but now he is stuck at one of the levels. To pass to the next level he has to prepare n potions.

Anton has a special kettle, that can prepare one potions in x seconds. Also, he knows spells of two types that can faster the process of preparing potions.  Spells of this type speed up the preparation time of one potion. There are m spells of this type, the i-th of them costs b_{i} manapoints and changes the preparation time of each potion to a_{i} instead of x.  Spells of this type immediately prepare some number of potions. There are k such spells, the i-th of them costs d_{i} manapoints and instantly create c_{i} potions. 

Anton can use no more than one spell of the first type and no more than one spell of the second type, and the total number of manapoints spent should not exceed s. Consider that all spells are used instantly and right before Anton starts to prepare potions.

Anton wants to get to the next level as fast as possible, so he is interested in the minimum number of time he needs to spent in order to prepare at least n potions.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of potions, Anton has to make, the number of spells of the first type and the number of spells of the second type.

The second line of the input contains two integers x and s (2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9) — the initial number of seconds required to prepare one potion and the number of manapoints Anton can use.

The third line contains m integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} < x) — the number of seconds it will take to prepare one potion if the i-th spell of the first type is used.

The fourth line contains m integers b_{i} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of manapoints to use the i-th spell of the first type.

There are k integers c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ n) in the fifth line — the number of potions that will be immediately created if the i-th spell of the second type is used. It's guaranteed that c_{i} are not decreasing, i.e. c_{i} ≤ c_{j} if i < j.

The sixth line contains k integers d_{i} (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of manapoints required to use the i-th spell of the second type. It's guaranteed that d_{i} are not decreasing, i.e. d_{i} ≤ d_{j} if i < j.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum time one has to spent in order to prepare n potions.


-----Examples-----
Input
20 3 2
10 99
2 4 3
20 10 40
4 15
10 80

Output
20

Input
20 3 2
10 99
2 4 3
200 100 400
4 15
100 800

Output
200



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the optimum answer is to use the second spell of the first type that costs 10 manapoints. Thus, the preparation time of each potion changes to 4 seconds. Also, Anton should use the second spell of the second type to instantly prepare 15 potions spending 80 manapoints. The total number of manapoints used is 10 + 80 = 90, and the preparation time is 4·5 = 20 seconds (15 potions were prepared instantly, and the remaining 5 will take 4 seconds each).

In the second sample, Anton can't use any of the spells, so he just prepares 20 potions, spending 10 seconds on each of them and the answer is 20·10 = 200.
Program:
```

    import sys

    data = input().split()

    d = list(map(int, data[5 + 2 * m + k:5 + 2 * m + 2 * k]))
    result = func_1(n, m, k, x, s, a, b, c, d)
    print(result)

def func_1(n, m, k, x, s, a, b, c, d):
    min_time = n * x
    for i in range(k):
        if d[i] <= s:
            remaining_potions = max(0, n - c[i])
            time_with_spell = remaining_potions * x
            min_time = min(min_time, time_with_spell)
    for i in range(m):
        if b[i] <= s:
            time_with_spell = n * a[i]
            min_time = min(min_time, time_with_spell)
    for i in range(m):
        if b[i] <= s:
            remaining_manapoints = s - b[i]
            for j in range(k):
                if d[j] <= remaining_manapoints:
                    remaining_potions = max(0, n - c[j])
                    time_with_both_spells = remaining_potions * a[i]
                    min_time = min(min_time, time_with_both_spells)
                else:
                    break
    return min_time


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
