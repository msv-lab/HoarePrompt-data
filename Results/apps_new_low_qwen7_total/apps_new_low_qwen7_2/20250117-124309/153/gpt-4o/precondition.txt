n, m, k are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2·10^5. x, s are positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9. a is a list of m positive integers where 1 ≤ a[i] < x for all 0 ≤ i < m. b is a list of m positive integers where 1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 2·10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < m. c is a non-decreasing list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ n for all 0 ≤ i < k. d is a non-decreasing list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ d[i] ≤ 2·10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < k.
