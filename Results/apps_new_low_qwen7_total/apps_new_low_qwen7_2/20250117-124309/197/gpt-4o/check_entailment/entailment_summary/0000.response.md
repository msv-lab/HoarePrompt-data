Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it meets the problem requirements.

### Analysis of `func_1`
- `func_1` is used for modular exponentiation, which is necessary to compute \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) efficiently.
- This function uses the exponentiation by squaring method, which is optimal for large exponents and ensures correctness for the given constraints.

### Analysis of `func_2`
- `func_2` handles the main computation required for the problem.
- **Step-by-step breakdown:**
  1. **Base Case:** If `x` is 0, it returns 0, which is correct.
  2. **Exponentiation Calculation:** It calculates \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) using `func_1`.
  3. **Final Calculation:** It computes the expected number of dresses using the formula \(x \cdot (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
    - This formula accounts for the doubling of dresses each month followed by a 50% chance of losing one dress (if any).

### Edge Cases and Correctness Verification
- **Edge Case 1: \(x = 0\)** 
  - The function correctly returns 0.
- **Edge Case 2: \(k = 0\) (1 month in the year)**
  - For \(k = 0\), \(2^{1} - 1 = 1\), leading to \(x \cdot 1 \mod (10^9 + 7) = x \mod (10^9 + 7)\), which is correct.
- **General Case:**
  - The function correctly applies the logic of doubling dresses each month and accounting for the 50% chance of losing one dress.

Given the analysis, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly implement the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
