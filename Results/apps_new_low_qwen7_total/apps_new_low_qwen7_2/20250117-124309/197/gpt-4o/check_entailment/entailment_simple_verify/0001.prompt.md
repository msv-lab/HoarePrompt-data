You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nastya received a gift on New Year — a magic wardrobe. It is magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it doubles (i.e. the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it is in the beginning of the month).

Unfortunately, right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of the dresses (if any) with the 50% probability. It happens every month except the last one in the year. 

Nastya owns x dresses now, so she became interested in the expected number of dresses she will have in one year. Nastya lives in Byteland, so the year lasts for k + 1 months.

Nastya is really busy, so she wants you to solve this problem. You are the programmer, after all. Also, you should find the answer modulo 10^9 + 7, because it is easy to see that it is always integer.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers x and k (0 ≤ x, k ≤ 10^18), where x is the initial number of dresses and k + 1 is the number of months in a year in Byteland.


-----Output-----

In the only line print a single integer — the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 0

Output
4

Input
2 1

Output
7

Input
3 2

Output
21



-----Note-----

In the first example a year consists on only one month, so the wardrobe does not eat dresses at all.

In the second example after the first month there are 3 dresses with 50% probability and 4 dresses with 50% probability. Thus, in the end of the year there are 6 dresses with 50% probability and 8 dresses with 50% probability. This way the answer for this test is (6 + 8) / 2 = 7.

- Program: 
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base % mod
        base = base * base % mod
        exponent //= 2
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2(x, k):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    power = func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)
    result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD
    return result

import sys

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
input = sys.stdin.read
(x, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_2(x, k))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: base is a non-negative integer, exponent is a non-negative integer, and mod is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
def func_1(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base % mod
        
        base = base * base % mod
        
        exponent //= 2
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: base is \( \text{base}^{\lfloor \log_2(\text{exponent}) \rfloor} \mod \text{mod} \), exponent is 0, result is the product of the original base raised to the power of the 1s in the binary representation of the original exponent, all taken modulo mod.
    return result
    #The program returns result which is the product of the original base raised to the power of the 1s in the binary representation of the original exponent, all taken modulo mod. Since exponent is 0, the binary representation of exponent is 0, which has no 1s, so the result is 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the initial number of dresses, k is an integer representing the number of months in a year minus one (k + 1 is the total number of months in the year), and MOD is a constant equal to 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(x, k):
    if (x == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer representing the initial number of dresses, k is an integer representing the number of months in a year minus one (k + 1 is the total number of months in the year), and MOD is a constant equal to 10^9 + 7. The value of x is not zero.
    power = func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)

result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD
    return result
    #`The program returns (x * ((2




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The given program defines two functions:
   - `func_1`: This function calculates `(base ^ exponent) % mod` using the method of exponentiation by squaring, which is an efficient algorithm for modular exponentiation.
   - `func_2`: This function calculates the expected number of dresses after one year. Here's how it works:
     - If `x == 0`, it returns `0` immediately, meaning if Nastya starts with no dresses, she will still have no dresses.
     - Otherwise, it uses `func_1` to calculate the number of dresses before considering the wardrobe eating one dress with 50% probability each month (except the last month).
     - It then computes the expected number of dresses as `x * (2^(k+1) - 1) % MOD`.

2. The logic in `func_2` appears correct:
   - Doubling the number of dresses over `k+1` months gives `2^(k+1)` times the initial number of dresses.
   - Subtracting one accounts for the fact that the wardrobe eats one dress with 50% probability each month (except the last one), which effectively reduces the count by one half on average.
   - Multiplying by `x` and taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7` ensures the final answer fits within the required constraints and handles large numbers correctly.

3. However, there is a potential issue in `func_2`:
   - The line `result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD` can be simplified to just `result = x * (power - 1) % MOD` since `% MOD` applied twice is redundant.

Despite this minor optimization, the logic is fundamentally sound.
