Reasoning:

1. The given program defines two functions:
   - `func_1`: This function calculates `(base ^ exponent) % mod` using the method of exponentiation by squaring, which is an efficient algorithm for modular exponentiation.
   - `func_2`: This function calculates the expected number of dresses after one year. Here's how it works:
     - If `x == 0`, it returns `0` immediately, meaning if Nastya starts with no dresses, she will still have no dresses.
     - Otherwise, it uses `func_1` to calculate the number of dresses before considering the wardrobe eating one dress with 50% probability each month (except the last month).
     - It then computes the expected number of dresses as `x * (2^(k+1) - 1) % MOD`.

2. The logic in `func_2` appears correct:
   - Doubling the number of dresses over `k+1` months gives `2^(k+1)` times the initial number of dresses.
   - Subtracting one accounts for the fact that the wardrobe eats one dress with 50% probability each month (except the last one), which effectively reduces the count by one half on average.
   - Multiplying by `x` and taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7` ensures the final answer fits within the required constraints and handles large numbers correctly.

3. However, there is a potential issue in `func_2`:
   - The line `result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD` can be simplified to just `result = x * (power - 1) % MOD` since `% MOD` applied twice is redundant.

Despite this minor optimization, the logic is fundamentally sound.

Correctness: **True**
