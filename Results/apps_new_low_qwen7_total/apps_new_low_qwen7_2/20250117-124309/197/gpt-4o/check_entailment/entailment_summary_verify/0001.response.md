Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` is correctly implementing the modular exponentiation using the method of exponentiation by squaring. This is an efficient way to compute \((base^{exponent}) \mod mod\) without causing overflow issues due to very large intermediate results.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the expected number of dresses after one year, considering the doubling and the wardrobe eating one dress with 50% probability each month (except the last month).
   - **Initial Check:** The check `if x == 0` is correct and ensures that if Nastya starts with no dresses, she will still have no dresses.
   - **Exponentiation Calculation:** The call to `func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)` correctly calculates \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - **Expected Number Calculation:** The formula \(x * (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) is derived from the fact that the wardrobe doubles the dresses and then potentially eats one dress each month, which on average reduces the count by half. Thus, the expected number of dresses is \(x \times (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Simplification Note:**
   - The line `result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD` is indeed redundant, as `% MOD` applied twice is equivalent to just `% MOD`. This can be simplified to `result = x * (power - 1) % MOD`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `x == 0` correctly.
   - For `k == 0` (one month in the year), the calculation \(2^1 - 1 = 1\) leads to the correct output \(x \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - All operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, ensuring the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the expected number of dresses after one year, and the provided function summaries and code align well with the problem description.

Final: **True**
