You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nastya received a gift on New Year — a magic wardrobe. It is magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it doubles (i.e. the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it is in the beginning of the month).

Unfortunately, right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of the dresses (if any) with the 50% probability. It happens every month except the last one in the year. 

Nastya owns x dresses now, so she became interested in the expected number of dresses she will have in one year. Nastya lives in Byteland, so the year lasts for k + 1 months.

Nastya is really busy, so she wants you to solve this problem. You are the programmer, after all. Also, you should find the answer modulo 10^9 + 7, because it is easy to see that it is always integer.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers x and k (0 ≤ x, k ≤ 10^18), where x is the initial number of dresses and k + 1 is the number of months in a year in Byteland.


-----Output-----

In the only line print a single integer — the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 0

Output
4

Input
2 1

Output
7

Input
3 2

Output
21



-----Note-----

In the first example a year consists on only one month, so the wardrobe does not eat dresses at all.

In the second example after the first month there are 3 dresses with 50% probability and 4 dresses with 50% probability. Thus, in the end of the year there are 6 dresses with 50% probability and 8 dresses with 50% probability. This way the answer for this test is (6 + 8) / 2 = 7.

    return result

#State of the program right berfore the function call: base is a non-negative integer, exponent is a non-negative integer, and mod is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
def func_1(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base % mod
        
        base = base * base % mod

    return result
    #The program returns result which is the product of the original base raised to the power of the 1s in the binary representation of the original exponent, all taken modulo mod. Since exponent is 0, the binary representation of exponent is 0, which has no 1s, so the result is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `exponent`, and `mod`. It calculates the modular exponentiation of `base` raised to the power of `exponent` using an efficient method known as exponentiation by squaring, and returns the result modulo `mod`. Specifically, the function iteratively squares the `base` and multiplies it into the `result` when the current bit of `exponent` is 1. This process continues until `exponent` becomes 0. If `exponent` is 0 at the start, the function directly returns 1, as the binary representation of 0 has no 1s. The function ensures that all calculations are performed under modulo `mod` to handle large numbers efficiently.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the initial number of dresses, k is an integer representing the number of months in a year minus one (k + 1 is the total number of months in the year), and MOD is a constant equal to 10^9 + 7.

    if (x == 0) :
        return 0

The value of x is not zero.
    power = func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)

result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD
    return result

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` (an integer representing the initial number of dresses) and `k` (an integer representing the number of months in a year minus one, where `k + 1` is the total number of months in the year). It returns 0 if `x` is 0, otherwise, it calculates and returns \((x * ((2^{k+1}) - 1)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

The function performs the following actions:
1. Checks if `x` is 0. If true, it returns 0.
2. If `x` is not 0, it calculates \(2^{k+1}\) using `func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)`.
3. Computes the result as \(x * ((2^{k+1}) - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `x` is 0, the function correctly returns 0.
- If `k` is 0 (meaning there is only 1 month in the year), the function calculates \(2^{1} - 1 = 1\), resulting in a final output of \(x * 1 \mod (10^9 + 7) = x \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- The function ensures that all calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the wardrobe eats a dress with 50% probability after each doubling, except for the last month. The `func_2` function calculates the expected number of dresses without considering the wardrobe's behavior of eating one dress with 50% probability after doubling.

To fix this, the function needs to account for the fact that after each doubling (except the last one), there is a 50% chance that one dress will be eaten. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to calculate (base^exponent) % mod using fast exponentiation
def func_1(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base % mod
        base = base * base % mod
        exponent //= 2
    return result

# Function to calculate the expected number of dresses
def func_2(x, k):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the expected number of dresses after doubling and possibly eating one
    expected_dresses = 0
    for month in range(k + 1):
        if month < k:
            expected_dresses = (x * func_1(2, 1, MOD) + expected_dresses - 1) % MOD
        else:
            expected_dresses = (x * func_1(2, 1, MOD)) % MOD
    
    return expected_dresses

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    x, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_2(x, k))
```

This corrected function iterates through each month, correctly applying the doubling and the 50% probability of losing a dress. This ensures that the program works as described for all potential cases.
