Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nastya received a gift on New Year — a magic wardrobe. It is magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it doubles (i.e. the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it is in the beginning of the month).

Unfortunately, right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of the dresses (if any) with the 50% probability. It happens every month except the last one in the year. 

Nastya owns x dresses now, so she became interested in the expected number of dresses she will have in one year. Nastya lives in Byteland, so the year lasts for k + 1 months.

Nastya is really busy, so she wants you to solve this problem. You are the programmer, after all. Also, you should find the answer modulo 10^9 + 7, because it is easy to see that it is always integer.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers x and k (0 ≤ x, k ≤ 10^18), where x is the initial number of dresses and k + 1 is the number of months in a year in Byteland.


-----Output-----

In the only line print a single integer — the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 0

Output
4

Input
2 1

Output
7

Input
3 2

Output
21



-----Note-----

In the first example a year consists on only one month, so the wardrobe does not eat dresses at all.

In the second example after the first month there are 3 dresses with 50% probability and 4 dresses with 50% probability. Thus, in the end of the year there are 6 dresses with 50% probability and 8 dresses with 50% probability. This way the answer for this test is (6 + 8) / 2 = 7.

# Annotated Functions:
import sys

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
input = sys.stdin.read
(x, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_2(x, k))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: base is a non-negative integer, exponent is a non-negative integer, and mod is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
def func_1(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base % mod
        
        base = base * base % mod
        
        exponent //= 2
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: base is \( \text{base}^{\lfloor \log_2(\text{exponent}) \rfloor} \mod \text{mod} \), exponent is 0, result is the product of the original base raised to the power of the 1s in the binary representation of the original exponent, all taken modulo mod.
    return result
    #The program returns result which is the product of the original base raised to the power of the 1s in the binary representation of the original exponent, all taken modulo mod. Since exponent is 0, the binary representation of exponent is 0, which has no 1s, so the result is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `exponent`, and `mod`. It calculates the modular exponentiation of `base` raised to the power of `exponent` using an efficient method known as exponentiation by squaring, and returns the result modulo `mod`. Specifically, the function iteratively squares the `base` and multiplies it into the `result` when the current bit of `exponent` is 1. This process continues until `exponent` becomes 0. If `exponent` is 0 at the start, the function directly returns 1, as the binary representation of 0 has no 1s. The function ensures that all calculations are performed under modulo `mod` to handle large numbers efficiently.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the initial number of dresses, k is an integer representing the number of months in a year minus one (k + 1 is the total number of months in the year), and MOD is a constant equal to 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(x, k):
    if (x == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer representing the initial number of dresses, k is an integer representing the number of months in a year minus one (k + 1 is the total number of months in the year), and MOD is a constant equal to 10^9 + 7. The value of x is not zero.
    power = func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)

result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD
    return result
    #`The program returns (x * ((2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` (an integer representing the initial number of dresses) and `k` (an integer representing the number of months in a year minus one, where `k + 1` is the total number of months in the year). It returns 0 if `x` is 0, otherwise, it calculates and returns \((x * ((2^{k+1}) - 1)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

The function performs the following actions:
1. Checks if `x` is 0. If true, it returns 0.
2. If `x` is not 0, it calculates \(2^{k+1}\) using `func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)`.
3. Computes the result as \(x * ((2^{k+1}) - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `x` is 0, the function correctly returns 0.
- If `k` is 0 (meaning there is only 1 month in the year), the function calculates \(2^{1} - 1 = 1\), resulting in a final output of \(x * 1 \mod (10^9 + 7) = x \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- The function ensures that all calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.
