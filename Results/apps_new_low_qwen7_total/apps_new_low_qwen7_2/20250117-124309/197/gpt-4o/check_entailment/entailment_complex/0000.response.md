Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the expected number of dresses in a wardrobe over a year, considering the doubling effect and the 50% chance of losing a dress each month (except the last month).

2. **Modular Exponentiation Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly implements modular exponentiation using the exponentiation by squaring technique.
   - This function handles large exponents and ensures results are within the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) range.
   - The logic and implementation of the function are correct and appropriate for the problem.

3. **Main Calculation Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function checks if the initial number of dresses `x` is 0. If so, it returns 0 immediately, which is correct since if there are no dresses initially, there won't be any dresses after the year.
   - For non-zero initial number of dresses, the function calculates \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) using `func_1`.
   - It then computes the expected number of dresses as \(x \times (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - The logic and calculations in `func_2` are consistent with the problem's requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `x` is 0.
   - For small values of `k` (like 0), the function also produces the correct output.

5. **Overall Program Structure**:
   - The program reads input correctly and passes it to `func_2`.
   - The output is produced correctly according to the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all necessary cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
