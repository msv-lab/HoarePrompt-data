    return result
    #The program returns result which is the product of the original base raised to the power of the 1s in the binary representation of the original exponent, all taken modulo mod. Since exponent is 0, the binary representation of exponent is 0, which has no 1s, so the result is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `exponent`, and `mod`. It calculates the modular exponentiation of `base` raised to the power of `exponent` using an efficient method known as exponentiation by squaring, and returns the result modulo `mod`. Specifically, the function iteratively squares the `base` and multiplies it into the `result` when the current bit of `exponent` is 1. This process continues until `exponent` becomes 0. If `exponent` is 0 at the start, the function directly returns 1, as the binary representation of 0 has no 1s. The function ensures that all calculations are performed under modulo `mod` to handle large numbers efficiently.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the initial number of dresses, k is an integer representing the number of months in a year minus one (k + 1 is the total number of months in the year), and MOD is a constant equal to 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(x, k):
    if (x == 0) :
        return 0

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer representing the initial number of dresses, k is an integer representing the number of months in a year minus one (k + 1 is the total number of months in the year), and MOD is a constant equal to 10^9 + 7. The value of x is not zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` (an integer representing the initial number of dresses) and `k` (an integer representing the number of months in a year minus one, where `k + 1` is the total number of months in the year). It returns 0 if `x` is 0, otherwise, it calculates and returns \((x * ((2^{k+1}) - 1)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

The function performs the following actions:
1. Checks if `x` is 0. If true, it returns 0.
2. If `x` is not 0, it calculates \(2^{k+1}\) using `func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)`.
3. Computes the result as \(x * ((2^{k+1}) - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `x` is 0, the function correctly returns 0.
- If `k` is 0 (meaning there is only 1 month in the year), the function calculates \(2^{1} - 1 = 1\), resulting in a final output of \(x * 1 \mod (10^9 + 7) = x \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- The function ensures that all calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.
