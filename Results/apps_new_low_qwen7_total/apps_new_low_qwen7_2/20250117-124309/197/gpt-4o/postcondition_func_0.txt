The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `exponent`, and `mod`. It calculates the modular exponentiation of `base` raised to the power of `exponent` using an efficient method known as exponentiation by squaring, and returns the result modulo `mod`. Specifically, the function iteratively squares the `base` and multiplies it into the `result` when the current bit of `exponent` is 1. This process continues until `exponent` becomes 0. If `exponent` is 0 at the start, the function directly returns 1, as the binary representation of 0 has no 1s. The function ensures that all calculations are performed under modulo `mod` to handle large numbers efficiently.
