Output State: **x is an integer, k is an integer, MOD is 1000000007, power is (2^(k+1)) % 1000000007, result is (x * (power - 1)) % 1000000007**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates `power` using the function `func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)`, which computes \(2^{k+1} \mod 1000000007\).
- The second line then sets `result` to \(x \times (power - 1) \mod 1000000007\).

Since the exact value of `x` and `k` are not specified, they remain unchanged, and `MOD` remains as 1000000007. The new variables `power` and `result` are introduced based on the calculations performed.
