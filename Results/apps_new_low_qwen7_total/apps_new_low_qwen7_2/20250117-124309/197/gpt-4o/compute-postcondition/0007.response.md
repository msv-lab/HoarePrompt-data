`result` is updated by multiplying it with `base` and then taking the modulus with `mod`. The original value of `exponent` does not affect this calculation, but it's mentioned that `exponent` must be greater than 0. The state of `base` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`base` is the squared value of its original value modulo `mod`, `exponent` must be greater than 0, and `result` is the product of its original value and `base` modulo `mod`.**
