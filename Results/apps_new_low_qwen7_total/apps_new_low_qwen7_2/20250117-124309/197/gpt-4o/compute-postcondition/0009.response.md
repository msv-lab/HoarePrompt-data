Output State: **base is the squared value of its original value modulo mod, exponent is half of its original value, result is the product of its original value and base modulo mod if exponent % 2 == 1, otherwise it remains unchanged**

Explanation:
1. The first line `base = base * base % mod` squares the current value of `base` and takes the result modulo `mod`. This updates the value of `base` to be its squared value modulo `mod`.
2. The second line `exponent //= 2` divides the current value of `exponent` by 2 using integer division, updating `exponent` to be half of its original value.
3. The variable `result` is not affected by these two lines, so it retains its original value based on the precondition, which states that `result` is the product of its original value and `base` modulo `mod` if `exponent % 2 == 1`, and unchanged otherwise.

Thus, the final output state reflects the updated values of `base` and `exponent`, while `result` remains as per the initial condition.
