The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `exponent`, and `mod`. `base` is a non-negative integer, `exponent` is a non-negative integer, and `mod` is a positive integer with a specific value of \(10^9 + 7\). If the exponent is 0, the binary representation of the exponent is 0, which has no 1s, so the result is 1. Otherwise, the function returns the product of the original `base` raised to the power of the 1s in the binary representation of the original `exponent`, all taken modulo `mod`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three parameters: `base`, `exponent`, and `mod`, and return the product of `base` raised to the power of the 1s in the binary representation of `exponent`, all taken modulo `mod`. If `exponent` is 0, it returns 1.
