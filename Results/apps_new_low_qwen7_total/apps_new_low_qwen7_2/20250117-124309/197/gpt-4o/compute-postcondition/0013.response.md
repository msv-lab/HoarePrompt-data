Initial State: `base` is the squared value of its original value modulo `mod`, `exponent` is half of its original value and must be greater than 0, and `result` is updated as follows: if `exponent % 2 == 1`, then `result` is multiplied by `base` modulo `mod`.

Code Block:
```
base = base * base % mod
exponent //= 2
```

Analysis:
1. The first line updates `base` to be the square of its current value modulo `mod`.
2. The second line halves `exponent` (using integer division) and updates the value of `exponent`.

Since the initial values of `base` and `exponent` are not provided, we can represent them as `base_original` and `exponent_original` for clarity, where `base` is `base_original^2 % mod` and `exponent` is `exponent_original // 2` (and `exponent_original > 0`).

After running the code block:
- `base` is updated to `(base_original^2) % mod`.
- `exponent` is updated to `exponent_original // 2`.

No other variables are affected, and the value of `result` is not changed by these lines of code.

Output State: **base is (base_original^2) % mod, exponent is exponent_original // 2, result is unchanged**
