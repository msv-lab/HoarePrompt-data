`result` is assigned the value of `result * base % mod`. Since `base` is the squared value of its original value modulo `mod`, and `exponent` is half of its original value and must be greater than 0, these values remain unchanged. The only variable affected is `result`, which now holds the value of `result * base % mod`.

Output State: **`base` is the squared value of its original value modulo `mod`, `exponent` is half of its original value and must be greater than 0, `result` is result * base % mod**
