The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` and `k`. `x` is an integer representing the initial number of dresses, and `k` is an integer representing the number of months in a year minus one (with `k + 1` being the total number of months in the year). The function returns either 0 or \((x * ((2^{k+1}) - 1)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `x` and `k`, and return 0 or \((x * ((2^{k+1}) - 1)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) based on the given conditions.
