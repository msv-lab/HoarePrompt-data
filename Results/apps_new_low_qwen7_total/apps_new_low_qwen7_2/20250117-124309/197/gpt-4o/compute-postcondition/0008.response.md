Postcondition: ***`base` is the squared value of its original value modulo `mod`, `exponent` must be greater than 0, and `result` is the product of its original value and `base` modulo `mod`, since the if condition checks if `exponent % 2 == 1`, and if true, `result` will be updated to be the product of its original value and `base` modulo `mod`. If the condition is false, `result` remains unchanged.***
