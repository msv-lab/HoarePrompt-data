Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly find a counterexample for any given \( n \) within the specified range. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input \( n \) and loops through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
2. **Prime Checking Function**: The `func_1` function correctly checks whether a number is prime. It handles small numbers directly and uses an efficient algorithm to check larger numbers.
3. **Counterexample Search**: For each \( m \), the program calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if it is prime using `func_1`. If it finds a composite number, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

Since the problem guarantees that an answer exists and the program is designed to find such an \( m \) within the specified range, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case, making it correct.
