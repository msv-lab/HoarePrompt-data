Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
2. The provided code correctly implements this logic:
   - It reads an integer \( n \) from input.
   - It iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime using the function `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.
3. The function `func_1` correctly implements a primality test:
   - It handles small numbers directly (less than or equal to 1 returns `False`, 2 and 3 return `True`, and multiples of 2 or 3 return `False`).
   - It uses a loop to check for factors up to the square root of \( x \), with optimizations for checking potential factors (checking both \( i \) and \( i+2 \)).

Given the above analysis, the provided code does indeed correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem. The logic in the code matches the problem statement, and the function `func_1` is correctly implemented as per the provided function summary.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
