### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program and its components step-by-step to determine if it correctly finds a counterexample for the given hypothesis.

#### 1. Input Handling
- The program correctly reads the input \( n \) and loops through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
- This part of the program is correct and meets the requirements.

#### 2. Prime Checking Function (`func_1`)
- The function `func_1` checks if a number \( x \) is prime:
  - It handles small numbers directly (less than or equal to 3).
  - For numbers greater than 3, it uses a trial division method up to the square root of \( x \).

The logic of the function is as follows:
```python
def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

This function is a well-known efficient method to check for primality for numbers up to 1000. It correctly identifies primes and non-primes within the given constraints.

#### 3. Counterexample Search
- For each \( m \) from 1 to 1000, the program calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if it is prime using `func_1`.
- If it finds a composite number (a number that is not prime), it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

Given that the function `func_1` is correct and efficient, and the loop iterates through all possible \( m \) values, the program should find a counterexample for any given \( n \) within the specified range.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations

- **Initial State**: \( n \) is read from input, and \( m \) starts from 1.
- **Loop through \( m \)**:
  - For each \( m \), calculate \( x = n \cdot m + 1 \).
  - Call `func_1(x)` to check if \( x \) is prime.
  - If `func_1(x)` returns `False`, print \( m \) and break out of the loop.

Based on the annotations:
- The function `func_1` correctly returns `False` for composite numbers and `True` for prime numbers.
- The loop will always find a composite number within the specified range and print the corresponding \( m \).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the required functionality. It reads the input \( n \), checks for composite numbers in the form \( n \cdot m + 1 \), and prints the first \( m \) where \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime. Given the constraints and the correctness of the prime checking function, the program will always find a valid counterexample.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
