### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
   - The provided code correctly implements this by iterating over possible values of \( m \) and using the `func_1` function to check if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is prime.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements a primality test:
     - It handles small numbers directly.
     - It checks divisibility by 2 and 3.
     - It uses a loop to check for factors up to the square root of \( x \), with optimizations for checking potential factors.
   - The loop ensures that all potential factors are checked efficiently.

3. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main logic correctly reads \( n \) from input.
   - It iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime using `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Guaranteed Solution Existence**:
   - The problem guarantees that there exists at least one such \( m \) within the specified range, so the provided solution will always find a valid \( m \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \( n \cdot m + 1 \) might be a prime number, and it correctly identifies the first non-prime number by breaking out of the loop.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the program.
- The program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
