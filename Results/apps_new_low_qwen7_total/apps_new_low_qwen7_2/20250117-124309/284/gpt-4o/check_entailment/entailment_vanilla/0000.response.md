Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
2. The provided code correctly implements this logic:
   - It reads an integer \( n \) from input.
   - It iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime using the function `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.
3. The function `func_1` correctly implements a primality test:
   - It handles small numbers directly.
   - It checks divisibility by 2 and 3.
   - It uses a loop to check for factors up to the square root of \( x \), with optimizations for checking potential factors.
4. Since the problem guarantees that there exists at least one such \( m \) within the specified range, the provided solution will always find a valid \( m \).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
