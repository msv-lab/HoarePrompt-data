### Reasoning:

1. **Program Logic**:
   - The program aims to find an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
   - It iterates over values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is composite using the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` correctly implements a primality test.
   - It returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1, for numbers 2 and 3, and for numbers divisible by 2 or 3.
   - For larger numbers, it uses a more efficient trial division method starting from 5, checking divisibility up to the square root of the number.

3. **Execution**:
   - The main loop will continue until it finds a non-prime number of the form \( n \cdot m + 1 \).
   - Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), there will always be at least one \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is composite (since the set of primes is finite and sparse).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the first \( m \) for which \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime.
   - Since the function `func_1` is correct, the program will indeed find such an \( m \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for any \( n \) within the given constraints. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
