Reasoning:
The given annotated program is designed to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. The function `func_1` correctly determines whether a number is prime according to standard prime-checking algorithms. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from input.
2. **Loop Over Possible Values of `m`**: It iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. **Check if `n * m + 1` is Prime**: For each value of `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and uses the `func_1` function to check if the result is a prime number.
4. **Print and Exit**: If a non-prime number is found, it prints the corresponding `m` and exits the loop.

The `func_1` function:
- Returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1.
- Returns `True` for 2 and 3.
- Returns `False` for numbers divisible by 2 or 3.
- For other numbers, it performs a more efficient primality test by checking divisibility from 5 up to \(\sqrt{x}\) with steps of 6.

Given the guarantees in the problem statement (that there exists an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number), the program should always find and print a valid `m` within the specified range.

Therefore, the program logic is sound, and it meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
