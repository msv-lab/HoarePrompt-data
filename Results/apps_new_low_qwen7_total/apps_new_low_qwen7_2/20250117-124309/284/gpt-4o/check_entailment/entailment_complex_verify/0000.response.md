### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step using the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input \( n \) and initializes a loop to iterate over values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.

2. **Prime Checking Function**:
   - The `func_1` function checks if a number \( x \) is prime.
   - It correctly handles small numbers directly (less than or equal to 3).
   - For larger numbers, it uses a trial division method optimized by checking divisibility up to \(\sqrt{x}\) and skipping even numbers and multiples of 3.

3. **Counterexample Search**:
   - For each \( m \) in the range 1 to 1000, the program calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \).
   - It then checks if this value is prime using `func_1`.
   - If a non-prime number is found, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

#### Key Points to Verify:
- The function `func_1` is indeed correct in identifying primes.
- The loop for finding \( m \) will eventually terminate with a valid counterexample due to the problem's guarantee.
- The range for \( m \) (1 to 1000) is sufficiently large to ensure a counterexample is found.

Given the analysis:
- The program correctly implements the logic required to find a counterexample.
- The function `func_1` accurately determines primality.
- The loop will always find a valid \( m \) as guaranteed by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies a counterexample for the given hypothesis for any valid input \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
