You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func_1(x):
    if (x <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 1
    if (x <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 3
    if (x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i += 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x\) is greater than 3, and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, and the function returns None if no divisors are found within the loop, otherwise it returns False. `i` is the smallest value such that \(i * i > x\).
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` where \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\). It returns `True` if `x` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. Specifically:
- If `x` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `False`.
- If `x` is 2 or 3, the function returns `True`.
- If `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns `False`.
- For other values of `x`, the function checks divisibility starting from 5 up to \(\sqrt{x}\) by incrementing by 6 each time, checking both `i` and `i+2`. If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
2. The provided code correctly implements this logic:
   - It reads an integer \( n \) from input.
   - It iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime using the function `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.
3. The function `func_1` correctly implements a primality test:
   - It handles small numbers directly.
   - It checks divisibility by 2 and 3.
   - It uses a loop to check for factors up to the square root of \( x \), with optimizations for checking potential factors.
4. Since the problem guarantees that there exists at least one such \( m \) within the specified range, the provided solution will always find a valid \( m \).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem.
