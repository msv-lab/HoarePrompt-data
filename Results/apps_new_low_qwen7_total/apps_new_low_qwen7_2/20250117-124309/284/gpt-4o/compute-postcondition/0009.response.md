The code assigns the value 5 to the variable `i`. The initial conditions for `x` (it is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3; `i` is 5**
