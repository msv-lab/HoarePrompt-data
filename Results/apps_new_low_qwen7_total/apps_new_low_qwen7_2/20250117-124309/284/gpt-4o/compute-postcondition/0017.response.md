Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x\) is greater than 3, and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, and \(x\) is less than 25 or divisible by 2 or divisible by 3; if \(x\) is divisible by \(i\) or \(x\) is divisible by \(i + 2\), the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns None.***
