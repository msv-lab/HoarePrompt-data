The initial state is described by the conditions on `x`. The code snippet increments `i` by 6. Since `i` was not mentioned in the initial state, it is assumed to be a new variable initialized before this code snippet. However, the value of `i` remains unchanged as no initial value for `i` was provided.

The output state will reflect the change in `i` due to the addition of 6, while maintaining the conditions on `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3, and x is less than 25, or x is divisible by 2, or x is divisible by 3; `i` is increased by 6.**
