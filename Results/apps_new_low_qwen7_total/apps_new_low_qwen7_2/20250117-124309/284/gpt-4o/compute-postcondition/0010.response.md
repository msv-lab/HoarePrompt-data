Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i * i <= x`.
2. **Initial values**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x\) is greater than 3, and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3.
   - `i` is 5.

3. **Determine the loop execution condition**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `i * i <= x` must be true initially.
   - Since `i` is 5, we calculate \(i * i = 5 * 5 = 25\).
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute, \(25 \leq x\) must be true.

4. **Check the given constraints on `x`**:
   - From the problem, \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\) and \(x > 3\).
   - Additionally, \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3.
   - To satisfy both the loop condition and the constraints, \(x\) must be at least 25 (since \(25 \leq x\)) and still meet the criteria of being between 1 and 1000, not divisible by 2, and not divisible by 3.

Given these points, the only thing that needs to be ensured is that \(x\) must be at least 25 and still meets all the other constraints.

Thus, the final state right before the loop that ensures the loop can execute the first time is:

**State: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3, and x must be at least 25**
