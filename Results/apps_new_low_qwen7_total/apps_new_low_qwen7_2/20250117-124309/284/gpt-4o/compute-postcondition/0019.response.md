Let's analyze the given problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i * i <= x`.

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `i`.

3. **Check the current state**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is such that `i * i <= x`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i * i` must be strictly less than or equal to `x` in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 6 each time the function returns `None` (from the given conditions), we need to ensure that the new value of `i` still satisfies the loop condition `i * i <= x`.
   - Therefore, we need to increase `i` by 6 until `i * i > x`.

Given the current state, let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`. The next value of `i` should be `i_current + 6` (or more if necessary) to ensure `i * i > x`.

**Step-by-step reasoning**:
- If `i_current * i_current <= x`, then `i` needs to be increased to `i_current + 6` to ensure `i * i > x`.
- We don't need to adjust any other states since the only variable involved in the loop condition is `i`.

**Final state**:
- The variable `i` needs to be adjusted to ensure `i * i > x`.

**Answer**:
State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x\) is greater than 3, and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, and \(x\) is less than 25 or divisible by 2 or divisible by 3; if \(x\) is divisible by \(i\) or \(x\) is divisible by \(i + 2\), the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns None, and `i` must be increased by 6 to ensure \(i * i > x\)**.
