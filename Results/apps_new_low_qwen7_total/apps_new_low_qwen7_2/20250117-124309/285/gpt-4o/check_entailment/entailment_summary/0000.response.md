Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem correctly. It iterates through all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers with the given constraints and checks if any combination exactly matches the initial amount of game-coins `n`. 

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the input `n` and calls the function `func_1(n)`.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It defines the costs of houses, cars, and computers.
   - It uses nested loops to iterate over the possible number of houses (`a`) and cars (`b`) that can be purchased.
   - For each combination of `a` and `b`, it calculates the remaining amount after purchasing those houses and cars.
   - It checks if the remaining amount is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer.
   - If such a combination is found, it immediately returns 'YES'.
   - If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, it returns 'NO'.

Given that the logic follows the problem statement accurately and the constraints are handled properly, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range.

Correctness: **True**
