You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.

- Program:
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It attempts to determine if it is possible to purchase a combination of houses, cars, and computers using exactly `n` units of currency. Each house costs `1234567` units, each car costs `123456` units, and each computer costs `1234` units. The function iterates over possible combinations of houses and cars to find if there exists a combination where the remaining amount of currency is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer. If such a combination is found, the function returns 'YES'. If no such combination is found, the function returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins using only houses (1,234,567 coins each), cars (123,456 coins each), and computers (1,234 coins each). 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all cases:

1. The program iterates over possible values of `a` (number of houses) from 0 to `n // house_cost`.
2. For each value of `a`, it calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `a` houses (`remaining_after_houses`).
3. It then iterates over possible values of `b` (number of cars) from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
4. For each value of `b`, it calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `b` cars (`remaining_after_cars`).
5. If the remaining coins (`remaining_after_cars`) are exactly divisible by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`), it means Kolya could have spent all his initial `n` coins buying only houses, cars, and computers.

Since the program systematically checks all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers, it covers all potential scenarios where Kolya could have spent all his coins. Therefore, the program is correct.
