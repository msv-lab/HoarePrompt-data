### Reasoning

The original assessment claims that the provided program correctly checks if it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins using only houses (1,234,567 coins each), cars (123,456 coins each), and computers (1,234 coins each). Let's break down the program and the logic step-by-step to verify this claim.

#### Program Breakdown

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. **Function Call**: It calls the `func_1` function with `n` as the argument.
3. **Main Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes the costs of houses, cars, and computers.
   - It uses a nested loop structure to iterate over possible numbers of houses (`a`) and cars (`b`).
   - For each combination of `a` and `b`, it calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `a` houses and `b` cars.
   - If the remaining coins are exactly divisible by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`), it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such combination is found after iterating through all possibilities, it returns 'NO'.

#### Correctness Analysis

To determine if the program is correct, we need to ensure that it covers all possible scenarios where Kolya could have spent exactly `n` coins using the given items. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Range of Values**: The program iterates over possible values of `a` from 0 to `n // house_cost` and `b` from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. This ensures that all combinations of houses and cars are checked.
2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The condition `if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:` correctly checks if the remaining coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer.
3. **Comprehensive Search**: The nested loops ensure that all combinations of `a` and `b` are considered, which is necessary to cover all possible scenarios.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program should indeed check all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers to determine if Kolya could have spent exactly `n` coins.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins using only houses, cars, and computers.

**Final: True**

The program is correct and systematically checks all possible combinations to determine if Kolya could have spent exactly `n` coins.
