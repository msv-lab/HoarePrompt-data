### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem and the code step-by-step.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to determine if there exist non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:
  \[ a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n \]
- The program should return "YES" if such integers exist and "NO" otherwise.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is correctly read and converted to an integer \(n\).
   
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(a\) (number of houses).
   - For each \(a\), it calculates the remaining coins after buying \(a\) houses: `remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost`.
   - It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) (number of cars) using the remaining coins: `for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`.
   - For each combination of \(a\) and \(b\), it calculates the remaining coins after buying \(b\) cars: `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
   - If the remaining coins are exactly divisible by the cost of a computer (`1234`), it returns "YES".
   - If no combination of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) satisfies the condition, it returns "NO".

3. **Logic**:
   - The logic is correct. It uses a brute-force approach to check all combinations of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the given constraints.
   - The outer loop iterates up to \(n // house_cost\), ensuring that \(a\) is a valid non-negative integer.
   - The inner loop iterates up to \(remaining_after_houses // car_cost\), ensuring that \(b\) is a valid non-negative integer.
   - The condition `if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0` checks if the remaining coins are exactly divisible by the cost of a computer.

#### Annotated Code Validation:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the conditions under which the function returns "YES" or "NO".
- The outer loop ensures that all possible numbers of houses are considered.
- The inner loop ensures that all possible numbers of cars are considered for each number of houses.
- The final check ensures that the remaining coins after buying houses and cars are exactly divisible by the cost of a computer.

#### Example Verification:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: \( n = 1359257 \)
  - The code correctly identifies that \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 1 \) satisfy the equation: \( 1 \times 1234567 + 1 \times 123456 + 1 \times 1234 = 1359257 \).
  - The function returns "YES".
- **Example 2**:
  - Input: \( n = 17851817 \)
  - The code correctly identifies that no combination of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) satisfies the equation.
  - The function returns "NO".

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It uses a brute-force approach to check all possible combinations of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and returns the appropriate result based on the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
