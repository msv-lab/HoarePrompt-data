You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.

- Program: 
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567

car_cost = 123456

computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`. After the loop completes, the variable `a` will represent the number of houses purchased, `b` will represent the number of cars purchased such that the remaining amount is a multiple of `computer_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` will be zero because the loop will ensure that any remaining amount after buying houses and cars is exactly divisible by `computer_cost`.
    #
    #Since the loop will continue to iterate until `remaining_after_cars` is zero and it is confirmed that this condition holds, the final values will be:
    #- `a`: The maximum integer such that `n - a * house_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost) % car_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero.
    #- `b`: The maximum integer such that `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero.
    #- `remaining_after_cars`: 0, since the loop ensures that this value becomes zero before exiting.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after the loop finishes executing is:
    #Output State: `a` is the maximum integer such that `n - a * house_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost) % car_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero, `b` is the maximum integer such that `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero, and `remaining_after_cars` is 0.
    return 'NO'
    #'a' is the maximum integer such that `n - a * house_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost) % car_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero, 'b' is the maximum integer such that `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero, and 'remaining_after_cars' is 0, 'NO'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to check if the logic and implementation align with the problem requirements. The goal is to find if there exist non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:

\[ a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n \]

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the provided code:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The input is correctly read and converted to an integer.
   
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(a\) (number of houses).
   - For each \(a\), it calculates the remaining coins after buying \(a\) houses.
   - It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) (number of cars) using the remaining coins.
   - For each combination of \(a\) and \(b\), it calculates the remaining coins after buying \(b\) cars.
   - If the remaining coins are exactly divisible by the cost of a computer (`1234`), it returns "YES".
   - If no combination of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) satisfies the condition, it returns "NO".

3. **Logic**:
   - The logic is sound. It uses a brute-force approach to check all combinations of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the given constraints.
   - Since the costs of houses, cars, and computers are fixed, and the loop limits the number of iterations based on the maximum possible number of each item that can be bought, the algorithm will correctly identify if any combination matches the total \(n\).

Given this analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
