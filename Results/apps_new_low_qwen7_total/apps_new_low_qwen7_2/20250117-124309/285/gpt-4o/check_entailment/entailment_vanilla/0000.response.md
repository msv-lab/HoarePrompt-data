Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to check if the logic and implementation align with the problem requirements. The goal is to find if there exist non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:

\[ a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n \]

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the provided code:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The input is correctly read and converted to an integer.
   
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(a\) (number of houses).
   - For each \(a\), it calculates the remaining coins after buying \(a\) houses.
   - It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) (number of cars) using the remaining coins.
   - For each combination of \(a\) and \(b\), it calculates the remaining coins after buying \(b\) cars.
   - If the remaining coins are exactly divisible by the cost of a computer (`1234`), it returns "YES".
   - If no combination of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) satisfies the condition, it returns "NO".

3. **Logic**:
   - The logic is sound. It uses a brute-force approach to check all combinations of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the given constraints.
   - Since the costs of houses, cars, and computers are fixed, and the loop limits the number of iterations based on the maximum possible number of each item that can be bought, the algorithm will correctly identify if any combination matches the total \(n\).

Given this analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
