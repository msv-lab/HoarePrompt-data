Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly represents the logic to check if Kolya can spend all his initial `n` game-coins by buying houses, cars, and computers.
2. The nested loops iterate over possible numbers of houses (`a`) and cars (`b`) that can be bought with the given constraints.
3. For each combination of `a` and `b`, the code calculates the remaining coins after purchasing these items.
4. If the remaining coins are exactly divisible by the cost of a computer (`c`), the function returns "YES".
5. If no combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfies the condition, the function returns "NO".
6. The program does not use unnecessary variables like `car_cost` and `computer_cost` within the loop, which simplifies the logic and makes it more efficient.
7. The loop bounds are correctly set to ensure that only valid combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` are considered.
8. The logic to check divisibility by `computer_cost` and the overall structure of the solution are correct.

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if Kolya could have spent all his initial `n` game-coins by buying only houses, cars, and computers.

Correctness: **True**
