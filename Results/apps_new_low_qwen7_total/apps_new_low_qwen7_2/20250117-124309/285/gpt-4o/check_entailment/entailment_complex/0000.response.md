Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the provided solution. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the initial game-coin score `n` from the input.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n)` is defined to check if it's possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins on houses, cars, and computers.

3. **Nested Loops**: 
   - The outer loop iterates over the possible number of houses (`a`) that can be bought with `n` game-coins.
   - The inner loop iterates over the possible number of cars (`b`) that can be bought with the remaining game-coins after purchasing `a` houses.
   - For each combination of `a` and `b`, it checks if the remaining game-coins are exactly divisible by the cost of a computer (`c * 1234`).

4. **Termination Conditions**:
   - The loops terminate when either `a` or `b` exceeds the maximum possible value (i.e., `n // house_cost` or `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`).
   - If a combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` is found where `remaining_after_cars` is exactly divisible by `computer_cost`, the function immediately returns 'YES'.
   - If no such combination is found after exhausting all possibilities, the function returns 'NO'.

5. **Output Handling**: The result of the function call is printed, which is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the internal logic.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Kolya could have spent all of his initial `n` game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers.

Correctness: **True**
