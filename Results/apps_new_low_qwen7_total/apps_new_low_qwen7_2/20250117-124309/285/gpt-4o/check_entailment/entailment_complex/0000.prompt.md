Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.

# Annotated Program:
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567

car_cost = 123456

computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`. After the loop completes, the variable `a` will represent the number of houses purchased, `b` will represent the number of cars purchased such that the remaining amount is a multiple of `computer_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` will be zero because the loop will ensure that any remaining amount after buying houses and cars is exactly divisible by `computer_cost`.
    #
    #Since the loop will continue to iterate until `remaining_after_cars` is zero and it is confirmed that this condition holds, the final values will be:
    #- `a`: The maximum integer such that `n - a * house_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost) % car_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero.
    #- `b`: The maximum integer such that `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero.
    #- `remaining_after_cars`: 0, since the loop ensures that this value becomes zero before exiting.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after the loop finishes executing is:
    #Output State: `a` is the maximum integer such that `n - a * house_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost) % car_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero, `b` is the maximum integer such that `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero, and `remaining_after_cars` is 0.
    return 'NO'
    #'a' is the maximum integer such that `n - a * house_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost) % car_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero, 'b' is the maximum integer such that `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero, and 'remaining_after_cars' is 0, 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It attempts to determine if it is possible to purchase a combination of houses, cars, and computers using exactly `n` units of currency. Each house costs `1234567` units, each car costs `123456` units, and each computer costs `1234` units. The function iterates over possible combinations of houses and cars to find if there exists a combination where the remaining amount of currency is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer. If such a combination is found, the function returns 'YES'. If no such combination is found, the function returns 'NO'.
