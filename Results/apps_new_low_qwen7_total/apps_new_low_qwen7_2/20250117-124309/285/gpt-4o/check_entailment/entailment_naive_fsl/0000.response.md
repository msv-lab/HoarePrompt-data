Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins using only houses (1,234,567 coins each), cars (123,456 coins each), and computers (1,234 coins each). 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all cases:

1. The program iterates over possible values of `a` (number of houses) from 0 to `n // house_cost`.
2. For each value of `a`, it calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `a` houses (`remaining_after_houses`).
3. It then iterates over possible values of `b` (number of cars) from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
4. For each value of `b`, it calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `b` cars (`remaining_after_cars`).
5. If the remaining coins (`remaining_after_cars`) are exactly divisible by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`), it means Kolya could have spent all his initial `n` coins buying only houses, cars, and computers.

Since the program systematically checks all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers, it covers all potential scenarios where Kolya could have spent all his coins. Therefore, the program is correct.
