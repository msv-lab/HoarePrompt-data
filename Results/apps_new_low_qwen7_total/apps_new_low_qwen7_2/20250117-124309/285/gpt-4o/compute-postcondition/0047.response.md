Postcondition: ***`a` is 2, `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_old + 2) * car_cost`, `b` is `b_old + 1`, and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` remains the same. If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.***
