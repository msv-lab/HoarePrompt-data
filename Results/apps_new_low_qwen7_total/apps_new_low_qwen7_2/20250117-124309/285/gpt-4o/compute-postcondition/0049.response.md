Output State: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`. After the loop completes, the variable `a` will represent the number of houses purchased, `b` will represent the number of cars purchased such that the remaining amount is a multiple of `computer_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` will be zero because the loop will ensure that any remaining amount after buying houses and cars is exactly divisible by `computer_cost`.

Since the loop will continue to iterate until `remaining_after_cars` is zero and it is confirmed that this condition holds, the final values will be:
- `a`: The maximum integer such that `n - a * house_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost) % car_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero.
- `b`: The maximum integer such that `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero.
- `remaining_after_cars`: 0, since the loop ensures that this value becomes zero before exiting.

Therefore, the output state after the loop finishes executing is:
Output State: `a` is the maximum integer such that `n - a * house_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost) % car_cost` is non-negative and `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero, `b` is the maximum integer such that `(n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) % computer_cost` is zero, and `remaining_after_cars` is 0.
