`remaining_after_cars` is reassigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Given that `b` is 2, this means `remaining_after_cars` becomes `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`. The values of `a`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at least 1234567, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`**
