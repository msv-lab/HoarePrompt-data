`remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. The value of `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged, and `b` is updated to `b_old + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_old + 1) * car_cost`.

Given the precondition that `remaining_after_cars` is initially equal to `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`, we can substitute `remaining_after_houses - car_cost` for `remaining_after_cars` in the equation:

\[ \text{remaining\_after\_cars} = (\text{remaining\_after\_houses} - \text{car\_cost}) - (b_old + 1) \times \text{car\_cost} \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ \text{remaining\_after\_cars} = \text{remaining\_after\_houses} - \text{car\_cost} - b_old \times \text{car\_cost} - \text{car\_cost} \]
\[ \text{remaining\_after\_cars} = \text{remaining\_after\_houses} - (b_old + 2) \times \text{car\_cost} \]

Since `b` is now `b_old + 1`, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is 2, `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_old + 2) * car_cost`, `b` is `b_old + 1`, and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` remains the same.**
