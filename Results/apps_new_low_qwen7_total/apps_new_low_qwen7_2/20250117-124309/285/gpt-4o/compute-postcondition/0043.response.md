Postcondition: ***`a` is 2, `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `remaining_after_cars` is non-negative and equals `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is 0, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything since there is no else part.***
