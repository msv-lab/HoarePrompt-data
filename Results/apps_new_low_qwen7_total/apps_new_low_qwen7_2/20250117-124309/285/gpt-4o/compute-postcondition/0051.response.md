The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9. Based on the conditions described, the function returns 'YES' in all cases from Case_1 to Case_10, except for Case_10 where specific conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `remaining_after_cars` must be met before returning 'NO'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return 'YES' unless the specific conditions in Case_10 are met, in which case it returns 'NO'.
