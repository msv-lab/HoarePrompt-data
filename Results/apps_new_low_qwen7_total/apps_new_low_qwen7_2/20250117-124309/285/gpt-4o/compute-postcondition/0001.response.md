Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):`.
   - The variables involved are `a`, `n`, `house_cost`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute for each value of `a` in the range from `0` to `n // house_cost`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute the first time when `a` is `0`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `a`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `a = 0`, this is the initial value of `a`.

4. **Determine the condition on `n` and `house_cost`:**
   - For the loop to start executing, `n // house_cost + 1` must be at least `1`.
   - This means `n // house_cost` must be at least `0`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least `house_cost` (since `n // house_cost` will be `0` if `n < house_cost`).

5. **Verify the given values:**
   - `house_cost` is `1234567`.
   - `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 10^9`.
   - To ensure the loop starts, `n` must be at least `1234567`.

Given the above reasoning, the initial state for the loop to execute the first time should be:

- `a` is `0`.
- `n` must be at least `1234567`.

Thus, the final answer is:

**State: **`a` is 0, `n` must be at least 1234567**
