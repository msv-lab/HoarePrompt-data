The code `remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost` calculates the remaining value after subtracting `a * house_cost` from `n`. Given that `a` is 0, the expression simplifies to `remaining_after_houses = n - 0 * house_cost`, which further simplifies to `remaining_after_houses = n`. Since `n` must be at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` will also be at least 1234567.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `n` must be at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` is `n`**
