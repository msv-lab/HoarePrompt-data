Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `b` and `n`. However, since `n` is not directly used in the loop itself but rather is given as a state condition, it doesn't need to be adjusted here. The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `b`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs from `b = 0` to `b = remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `b` must be less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

3. **Current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 0, `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`. 

4. **Next iteration state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1. Since `b` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `b` would be `b + 1`. Also, the condition `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0` should still hold true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `a` remains 0 (unchanged)
- `n` remains at least 1234567 (unchanged)
- `b` is now `b + 1`
- `remaining_after_cars` is now `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`
- The condition `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0` should still hold true

However, since we are asked to provide the state in the required format, we only need to adjust the values of `b` and `remaining_after_cars`.

**State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at least 1234567, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`**
