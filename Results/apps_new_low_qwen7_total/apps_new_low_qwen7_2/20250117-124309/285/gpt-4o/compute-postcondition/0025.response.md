`remaining_after_cars` is updated to be `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Given that `b` is 1 and `car_cost` is not specified in the initial state but is a cost related to cars, we can express the new value of `remaining_after_cars` in terms of these known and unknown values.

Since `remaining_after_houses` is the same as `remaining_after_cars` initially, we can denote `remaining_after_houses` as `R`. Thus, the equation becomes:

\[ \text{remaining\_after\_cars} = R - 1 \times \text{car\_cost} = R - \text{car\_cost} \]

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states:
- `a` is 1
- `n` is at least 1234567
- `b` is 1
- `remaining_after_houses` remains `remaining_after_cars` (which is now \(R - \text{car\_cost}\))
- The condition `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0` is preserved.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `n` is at least 1234567, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`, and `remaining_after_houses % computer_cost` is not equal to 0**
