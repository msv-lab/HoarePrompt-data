Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It attempts to determine if it is possible to purchase a combination of houses, cars, and computers using exactly `n` units of currency. Each house costs `1234567` units, each car costs `123456` units, and each computer costs `1234` units. The function iterates over possible combinations of houses and cars to find if there exists a combination where the remaining amount of currency is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer. If such a combination is found, the function returns 'YES'. If no such combination is found, the function returns 'NO'.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is less than the cost of a single house (`1234567`), the function will immediately return 'NO' because it is impossible to buy even one house.
- If the loop completes without finding a valid combination (i.e., no remaining amount divisible by `1234`), the function returns 'NO'.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations suggest that the code should find specific values for `a`, `b`, and `remaining_after_cars` if a valid combination is found. However, the actual code only checks if the remaining amount is divisible by `1234` and returns 'YES' without storing these values. Therefore, the function does not store or return these specific values even if a valid combination is found.
