The initial state is:
- `a` is 0
- `n` is at least 1234567
- `b` is 1
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`

The code snippet is:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
```

Here, `remaining_after_cars` is reassigned to the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Since `b` is 1, this simplifies to `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `a` is 0
- `n` is at least 1234567
- `b` is 1
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`

Output State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at least 1234567, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`**
