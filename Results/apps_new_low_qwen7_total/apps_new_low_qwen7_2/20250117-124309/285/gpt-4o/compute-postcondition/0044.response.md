Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `b` and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is 2
   - `n` is at least 1234567
   - `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative
   - `remaining_after_cars` is non-negative and equals `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`.
   - If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is 0, the function returns 'YES'.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `b` was some value `b_old` (we don't know the exact value but it was less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `b` will be `b_old + 1`.
   - Since `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` does not change within the loop, this value remains the same.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `a` remains 2.
   - `n` remains at least 1234567.
   - `remaining_after_houses` remains non-negative.
   - `remaining_after_cars` remains non-negative and equals `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`b < remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`) will now check with the updated `b` value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is 2, `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `remaining_after_cars` is non-negative and equals `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`, `b` is `b_old + 1` where `b_old` was the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration, and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` remains the same.**
