`remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Given the initial state, `b` is 0, so the expression simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 0 * car_cost`, which further simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses`. Therefore, the value of `remaining_after_cars` remains the same as the value of `remaining_after_houses`.

Output State: **`a` is 2, `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `remaining_after_cars` is non-negative, `b` is 0**
