The given code block does not include any lines that modify the value of `n` or perform any operations that change the values of `house_cost`, `car_cost`, or `computer_cost`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, house_cost is 1234567, car_cost is 123456, computer_cost is 1234**
