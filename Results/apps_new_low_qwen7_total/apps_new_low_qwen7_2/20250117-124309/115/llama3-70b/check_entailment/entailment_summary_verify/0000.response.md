### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem requirements to validate the original assessment.

#### Original Program Analysis

The original program has the following issues:
1. **Incorrect Operation Selection**: The original program only appends an operation if all four elements in the \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are already \(1\). This is incorrect because we need to set the \(2 \times 2\) submatrix to \(1\) if any of the elements are \(1\).
2. **Redundant Operations**: The program can append the same operation multiple times, leading to redundant operations and potentially exceeding the limit of 2500 operations.

Here's the original program for reference:
```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
```

#### Corrected Program

The corrected program addresses these issues:
1. **Proper Operation Selection**: It appends an operation for any \(2 \times 2\) submatrix that contains at least one \(1\).
2. **Avoid Redundant Operations**: It avoids appending the same operation multiple times by ensuring each \(2 \times 2\) submatrix is processed only once.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = set()

    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                ops.add((i + 1, j + 1))

    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])

func()
```

#### Validation

With the corrected program, the function now correctly identifies all \(2 \times 2\) submatrices that need to be set to \(1\) and ensures no redundant operations are added. This aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The original program did not correctly implement the solution, but the proposed correction fixes the issue.
