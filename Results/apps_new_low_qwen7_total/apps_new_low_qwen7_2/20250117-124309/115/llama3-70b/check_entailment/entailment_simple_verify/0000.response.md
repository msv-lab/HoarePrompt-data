### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to make matrix \( B \) equal to matrix \( A \) by setting \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices of \( B \) to \( 1 \) if they correspond to \( 1 \) in \( A \).
   - The program should output a sequence of operations or return \(-1\) if it's impossible.

2. **Analyzed Program Code**:
   - The program iterates through each cell \((i, j)\) in \( A \) and checks if any of the adjacent cells in the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are \( 1 \).
   - It only appends the operation \((i+1, j+1)\) to `ops` if all four elements in the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are \( 1 \).

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The program initializes \( n \) and \( m \), reads the matrix \( A \), and sets up the operations list `ops`.
   - It iterates over each cell in \( A \) and checks if any of the adjacent cells in the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are \( 1 \). If so, it appends the operation to `ops`.
   - Finally, it prints the number of operations and the operations themselves.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not correctly implement the solution because it only appends an operation if all four elements in the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are already \( 1 \).
   - This is incorrect because the problem requires setting the entire \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix to \( 1 \) if any of its elements are \( 1 \), not just if all four are \( 1 \).

5. **Corrected Version**:
   - The original assessment provides a corrected version of the program that checks and sets the required \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices regardless of their initial state, ensuring that all necessary submatrices are set to \( 1 \).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original program does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement, but the provided corrected version does. Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not ensure that all required \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices are set to \( 1 \) whenever necessary. The corrected version provided in the original assessment addresses this issue.
