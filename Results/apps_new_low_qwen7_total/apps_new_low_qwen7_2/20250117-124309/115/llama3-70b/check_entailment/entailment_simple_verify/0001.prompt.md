You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ — the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.

After the loop completes all its iterations, `ops` will contain the coordinates of all cells \((k, k+1)\) for \(k\) from \(i - 1\) to \(n - 2\), provided that at least one of the conditions \(A[k][k+1] == 1\) or \(A[k+1][k+2] == 1\) is true for those coordinates. If no such cells exist, `ops` will remain an empty list. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the outer loop, while `j` increments to `m - 1` and then to `m` as the inner loop completes. The loop continues to append the next coordinate to `ops` until no more valid cells are found, and finally, `i` reaches `n - 1`.

If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the printed value is the last printed tuple (if any).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) using the given operations. An operation sets four elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix to 1. 

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) from the input.
   - It then reads the matrix \( A \) row by row.
   - It initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations needed.
   - It iterates over all positions \((i, j)\) where \(1 \leq i < n\) and \(1 \leq j < m\).
     - For each position, it checks if the corresponding \(2 \times 2\) submatrix in \( A \) needs to be modified.
     - If any of the four elements in the \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are 1, it adds the operation \((i+1, j+1)\) to the list `ops`.
   - Finally, it checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500. If so, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations followed by the operations themselves.

3. **Issues with the Given Code**:
   - The logic for adding operations is flawed. The current implementation adds an operation whenever any of the four elements in the \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are 1, which is not necessarily correct. We should only add an operation if the entire \(2 \times 2\) submatrix is supposed to be transformed to 1s.
   - The logic does not account for the possibility that some parts of \( A \) might already be 1s, and we should only operate on the necessary submatrices.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate through the matrix and identify all \(2 \times 2\) submatrices that need to be transformed.
   - Only add an operation if the entire \(2 \times 2\) submatrix in \( A \) is composed of 1s.
   - Ensure that the sequence of operations will correctly transform \( B \) into \( A \).

Given the issues with the provided code, the current implementation is not correct.
