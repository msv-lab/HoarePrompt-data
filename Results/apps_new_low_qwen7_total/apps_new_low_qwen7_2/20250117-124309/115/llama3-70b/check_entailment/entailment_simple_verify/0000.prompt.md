You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ — the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.

-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$

After the loop completes all its iterations, `ops` will contain the coordinates of all cells \((k, k+1)\) for \(k\) from \(i - 1\) to \(n - 2\), provided that at least one of the conditions \(A[k][k+1] == 1\) or \(A[k+1][k+2] == 1\) is true for those coordinates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for making matrix \( B \) equal to matrix \( A \). Specifically, the program does not ensure that all required \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices are set to \( 1 \) whenever necessary to match \( A \). 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
```

The program will not produce the correct sequence of operations to transform \( B \) into \( A \). According to the problem description, we need to ensure that for every \( 1 \) in \( A \), the corresponding \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix in \( B \) is set to \( 1 \). However, the current implementation only appends an operation if all four elements in the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are already \( 1 \), which is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to modify the program to check and set the required \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices regardless of their initial state. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []

    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
            if A[i + 1][j] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
            if A[i][j + 1] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
            if A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))

    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all necessary \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices are set to \( 1 \) if they contain at least one \( 1 \) from matrix \( A \).
