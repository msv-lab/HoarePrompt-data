Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) using the given operations. An operation sets four elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix to 1. 

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) from the input.
   - It then reads the matrix \( A \) row by row.
   - It initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations needed.
   - It iterates over all positions \((i, j)\) where \(1 \leq i < n\) and \(1 \leq j < m\).
     - For each position, it checks if the corresponding \(2 \times 2\) submatrix in \( A \) needs to be modified.
     - If any of the four elements in the \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are 1, it adds the operation \((i+1, j+1)\) to the list `ops`.
   - Finally, it checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500. If so, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations followed by the operations themselves.

3. **Issues with the Given Code**:
   - The logic for adding operations is flawed. The current implementation adds an operation whenever any of the four elements in the \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are 1, which is not necessarily correct. We should only add an operation if the entire \(2 \times 2\) submatrix is supposed to be transformed to 1s.
   - The logic does not account for the possibility that some parts of \( A \) might already be 1s, and we should only operate on the necessary submatrices.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate through the matrix and identify all \(2 \times 2\) submatrices that need to be transformed.
   - Only add an operation if the entire \(2 \times 2\) submatrix in \( A \) is composed of 1s.
   - Ensure that the sequence of operations will correctly transform \( B \) into \( A \).

Given the issues with the provided code, the current implementation is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
