Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for making matrix \( B \) equal to matrix \( A \). Specifically, the program does not ensure that all required \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices are set to \( 1 \) whenever necessary to match \( A \). 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
```

The program will not produce the correct sequence of operations to transform \( B \) into \( A \). According to the problem description, we need to ensure that for every \( 1 \) in \( A \), the corresponding \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix in \( B \) is set to \( 1 \). However, the current implementation only appends an operation if all four elements in the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are already \( 1 \), which is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to modify the program to check and set the required \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices regardless of their initial state. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []

    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
            if A[i + 1][j] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
            if A[i][j + 1] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
            if A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))

    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all necessary \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices are set to \( 1 \) if they contain at least one \( 1 \) from matrix \( A \).
