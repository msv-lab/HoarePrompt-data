Reasoning:
1. The provided solution does not correctly handle the problem statement. The logic in the `for` loops checks for conditions that do not align with the requirement to make `B` equal to `A` through specific `2x2` submatrix operations.
2. The solution attempts to find cells `(i, j)` where at least one of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i+1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j+1] == 1`, or `A[i+1][j+1] == 1` is true, which is not sufficient to guarantee that `B` can be transformed into `A`.
3. The solution does not account for the fact that a `2x2` submatrix must be completely filled with `1`s to match the corresponding elements in `A`. It merely checks individual elements and does not ensure the entire `2x2` submatrix is correctly set.
4. The output format is also incorrect. The code should only output the operations needed to transform `B` into `A`, but instead, it prints a sequence of coordinates without ensuring the transformations are correct.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
