Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided code and compare it against the problem statement and the given execution summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the matrix.
   - It also correctly reads the matrix \( A \) from the input.

2. **Identifying Operations:**
   - The code checks each \(2 \times 2\) submatrix in \( A \) starting from the top-left corner.
   - For each position \((i, j)\), it checks if any of the four elements in the submatrix are 1. 
   - If any of the four elements are 1, it adds the coordinate \((i+1, j+1)\) to the list `ops`.

3. **Checking Constraint:**
   - The code checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500 and prints -1 if so.

4. **Output:**
   - If the number of operations is within the limit, it prints the number of operations followed by the coordinates of the operations.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic used to identify the operations:
- The current logic will only record the operations when all four elements in a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are 1. This means it will miss cases where only one or two of the four elements are 1.
- The problem statement requires transforming \( B \) to match \( A \), which means we need to turn all 1s in \( A \) into 1s in \( B \) using \(2 \times 2\) submatrix operations. The provided logic does not ensure this transformation for all cases.

Given this analysis, the provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated because it does not account for all necessary transformations.

Correctness: **False**
