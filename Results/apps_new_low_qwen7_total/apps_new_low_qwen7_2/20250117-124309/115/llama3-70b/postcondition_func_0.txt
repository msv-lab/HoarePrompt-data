The function processes an \( n \times m \) matrix \( A \) where each element is either 0 or 1. It identifies pairs of adjacent cells \((k, k+1)\) where at least one of the cells is 1. If more than 2500 such pairs are found, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the count of such pairs followed by the coordinates of these pairs.
