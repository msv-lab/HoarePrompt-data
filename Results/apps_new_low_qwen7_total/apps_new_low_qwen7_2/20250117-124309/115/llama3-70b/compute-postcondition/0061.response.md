Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1. `ops` contains the coordinates of all cells \((k, k+1)\) for \(k\) from `i - 1` to `n - 2` where at least one of the conditions \(A[k][k+1] == 1\) or \(A[k+1][k+2] == 1\) is true, provided that `i` does not reach `n - 1` and the length of `ops` does not exceed 2500. If no such cells exist, `ops` remains an empty list.**
