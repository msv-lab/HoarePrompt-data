Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is a list. At least one of the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i + 1][j]\), \(A[i][j + 1]\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1]\) is equal to 1, and if this condition is met, `ops` contains \((2, m)\). Otherwise, no changes are made to `ops` and it remains an empty list.***
