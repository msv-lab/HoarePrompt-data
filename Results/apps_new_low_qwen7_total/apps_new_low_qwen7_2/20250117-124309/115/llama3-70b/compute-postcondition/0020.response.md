The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must satisfy \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` contains all coordinates \((1, j)\) for \(j\) from `0` to `m-1` if any of the conditions in the if statement are true for those coordinates. Otherwise, `ops` remains an empty list.**
