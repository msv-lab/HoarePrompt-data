Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `op`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `j` is `m`
   - `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\)
   - `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
   - `ops` is a non-empty list
   - The printed value is `op[0]` and `op[1]`

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `ops` list.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `ops`, the variable `op` changes with each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `op` would have been the current element from the `ops` list.
   - For the next iteration, `op` should be set to the next element in the `ops` list.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `op` to reflect the next element in the `ops` list.

**Final State**:
- `i` remains `n - 1`
- `j` remains `m`
- `n` and `m` remain \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\)
- `A` remains an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a non-empty list, but the first element `op[0]` and `op[1]` will change to the next element in the list

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a non-empty list, and the printed value is the next `op[0]` and `op[1]` in the list**.
