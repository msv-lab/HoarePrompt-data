The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **- `i` remains unchanged at 0. - `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `j = 2`. - The constraints on `n` and `m` remain the same. - The matrix `A` remains unchanged. - The list `ops` remains unchanged.**
