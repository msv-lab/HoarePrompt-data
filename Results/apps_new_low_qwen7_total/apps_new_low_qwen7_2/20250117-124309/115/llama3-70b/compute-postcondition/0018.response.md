Postcondition: ***`i` remains 0, `j` is either 3 or 4, and `ops` includes either `(1, 4)` or `(1, 3)`. If any of the conditions in the if statement are true (i.e., `A[i][j] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j] == 1` or `A[i][j + 1] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`), then `j` is 3. Otherwise, `j` remains 4. The matrix `A` and the list `ops` remain unchanged.***
