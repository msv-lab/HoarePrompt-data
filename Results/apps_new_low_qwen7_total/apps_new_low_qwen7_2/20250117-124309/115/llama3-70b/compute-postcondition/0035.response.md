Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is a list. If the condition \(A[i][j] == 1\) and \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) and \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) and \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) is true, then the function continues execution under this condition. Otherwise, the function continues execution without any change to the specified variables.***
