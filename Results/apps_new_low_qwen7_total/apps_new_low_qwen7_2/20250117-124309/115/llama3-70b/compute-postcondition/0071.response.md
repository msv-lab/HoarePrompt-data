The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints given, it seems the function should operate on a matrix `A` which is an \( n \times m \) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1. The function's behavior is not specified in the snippet, but we can infer that it might return some information about the matrix.

Given the constraints:
- \( n \) and \( m \) are integers such that \( 2 \le n, m \le 50 \).
- \( A \) is an \( n \times m \) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.

The functionality of the function `func` would involve processing the matrix \( A \). Since the output is not specified, we cannot provide a detailed return statement without more information.

Functionality: **The function processes an \( n \times m \) matrix \( A \) where each element is either 0 or 1, and returns some unspecified information about the matrix.**
