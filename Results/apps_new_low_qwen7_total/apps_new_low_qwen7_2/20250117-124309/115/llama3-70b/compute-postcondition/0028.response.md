Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `j`. The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is `m - 1`
   - `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\)
   - `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
   - `ops` is a list
   - At least one of the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i + 1][j]\), \(A[i][j + 1]\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1]\) is equal to 1, and if this condition is met, `ops` contains \((2, m)\). Otherwise, no changes are made to `ops` and it remains an empty list.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs over `j` from `0` to `m - 2`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `m - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `m`.
   - Since the loop runs up to `m - 2`, `j` cannot be `m` for the loop to continue. Therefore, the loop does not execute one more time because `j` would exceed the upper bound of the loop.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` should be set to `m` since the loop will not execute one more time.
   - `n` and `m` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `A` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ops` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case is not executed) remains the same as the current state.

**State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is a list.**
