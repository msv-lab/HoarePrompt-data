Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` and `m` must satisfy 2 <= n, m <= 50, `A` is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is `[ (1, 1) ]` if at least one of the following conditions is true: `A[0][0] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j] == 1` or `A[i][j + 1] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, otherwise `ops` remains an empty list.***
