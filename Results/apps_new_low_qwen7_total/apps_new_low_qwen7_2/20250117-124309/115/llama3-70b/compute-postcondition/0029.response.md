The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop context is provided, the `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables. The variables `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, `A`, and `ops` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is a list.**
