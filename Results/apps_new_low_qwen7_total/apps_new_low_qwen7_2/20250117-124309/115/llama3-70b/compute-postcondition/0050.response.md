The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, `j` is `m`, and the conditions for `ops` are checked based on the matrix `A`, the value of `i + 1` is 3 and `j + 1` is `m + 1`. Since these are the only changes, the updated state will reflect this.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `m`, `ops` contains the coordinate `(3, m + 1)`, and the conditions for `ops` remain the same.**
