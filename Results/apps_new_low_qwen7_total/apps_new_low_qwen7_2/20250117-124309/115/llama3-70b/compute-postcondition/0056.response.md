Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1. The matrix `A` at positions \((3, m)\) and \((4, m)\) is set to 0, and `ops` contains the coordinates \((3, m)\) and \((4, m)\). The length of `ops` is 2.***
