Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is a list. If the condition \(A[i][j] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) or \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) is true, then `ops` is appended with `(2, m + 2)`. Otherwise, the list `ops` remains unchanged.***
