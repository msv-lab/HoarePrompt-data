Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1. After the loop completes all its iterations, `ops` will contain the coordinates of all cells \((k, k+1)\) for \(k\) from 3 to \(n\), provided that at least one of the conditions \(A[k][k+1] == 1\) or \(A[k+1][k+2] == 1\) is true for those coordinates. If no such cells exist, `ops` will remain an empty list. The variable `i` remains constant at 2 throughout the loop, and `j` increments to `m - 1` and then to `m` as the loop iterates. The loop continues to append the next coordinate to `ops` until no more valid cells are found.
