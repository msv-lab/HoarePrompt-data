Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1; `ops` remains an empty list if the condition \(A[i][j] == 1\) and \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) and \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) and \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) is not met. Otherwise, `ops` contains the coordinate \((3, m)\).***
