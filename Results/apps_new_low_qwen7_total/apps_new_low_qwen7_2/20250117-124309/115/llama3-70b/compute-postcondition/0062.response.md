The code snippet prints the length of the list `ops`. The list `ops` is constructed based on certain conditions involving the matrix `A`. However, the specific values of `A`, `i`, and `m` are not provided, only their constraints. The length of `ops` is determined by the number of valid operations defined by the conditions given.

Since the exact values of `A`, `i`, and `m` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact length of `ops`. But we can state the general outcome of the code based on the initial conditions and the operation performed.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is `m`
- `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\)
- `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` contains the coordinates of all cells \((k, k+1)\) for \(k\) from `i - 1` to `n - 2` where at least one of the conditions \(A[k][k+1] == 1\) or \(A[k+1][k+2] == 1\) is true, provided that `i` does not reach `n - 1` and the length of `ops` does not exceed 2500

Since `i` is `n - 1`, `i` does not reach `n - 1` (as `i` would be exactly `n - 1`). Therefore, the condition for constructing `ops` does not apply, meaning `ops` will remain an empty list.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list, and the printed value is 0.**
