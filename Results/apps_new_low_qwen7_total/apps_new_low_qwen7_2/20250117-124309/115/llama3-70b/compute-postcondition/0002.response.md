Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs based on the expression `range(m - 1)`.

2. **Understand the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(m - 1)`.
   - This means `j` should be between 0 and `m - 2` (inclusive).

3. **Initial Values and Constraints:**
   - `i` is initially 0.
   - `n` and `m` must satisfy `2 <= n, m <= 50`.
   - `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
   - `ops` is an empty list.

4. **Determine the State of Variables for the First Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be 0.
   - Since `j` is the loop variable and it ranges from 0 to `m - 2`, the smallest value `j` can take is 0.
   - Therefore, `j` should be 0 for the first iteration to occur.

Given this analysis, the state of the objects in the loop head must satisfy the following conditions for the loop to execute the first time:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `m` must satisfy 2 <= n, m <= 50, `A` is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list, `j` is 0**
