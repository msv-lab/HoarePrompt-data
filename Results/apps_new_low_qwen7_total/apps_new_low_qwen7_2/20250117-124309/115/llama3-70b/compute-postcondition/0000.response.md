The provided code reads two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a matrix `A`, which is then initialized with `n` rows and `m` columns, each containing elements that are either `0` or `1`. However, the code snippet given does not complete the initialization of matrix `A` and also does not perform any operations on it or assign any values to the `ops` list. Therefore, after executing the provided code snippet, the matrix `A` will be fully defined based on user input, and the `ops` list will remain empty.

Since no specific values are provided for `n`, `m`, and `A`, we can represent the final state in a general form.

Output State: **n and m are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, A is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, ops is an empty list**
