Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the coordinate \((2, j)\) since \(A[2][m-1] == 1\) and the adjacent elements \(A[2][m], A[3][m-1], A[3][m]\) also equal 1, otherwise `ops` remains an empty list**
