Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list, and at least one of the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i + 1][j]\), \(A[i][j + 1]\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1]\) is equal to 1.**
