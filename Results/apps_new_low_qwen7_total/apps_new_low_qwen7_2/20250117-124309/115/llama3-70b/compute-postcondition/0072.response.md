Functionality: **The function processes an \( n \times m \) matrix \( A \) where each element is either 0 or 1. It identifies pairs of adjacent cells \((k, k+1)\) where at least one of the cells is 1. If more than 2500 such pairs are found, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the count of such pairs followed by the coordinates of these pairs.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If no valid pairs \((k, k+1)\) are found, `ops` will be an empty list, and the function will print 0.
- The function does not handle the case where the input matrix \( A \) might be invalid (e.g., dimensions out of bounds or elements not being 0 or 1). However, the function assumes that \( 2 \leq n, m \leq 50 \) and each element in \( A \) is either 0 or 1.
- The function does not check for any specific constraints on the values of \( n \) and \( m \) other than \( 2 \leq n, m \leq 50 \). If these constraints are not met, the behavior of the function is undefined.
