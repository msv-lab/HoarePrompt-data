The code `print(op[0], op[1])` simply prints the first and second elements of the `ops` list. This does not change any variables but rather outputs them. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, and the matrix `A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a non-empty list, and the printed value is the next `op[0]` and `op[1]` in the list**
