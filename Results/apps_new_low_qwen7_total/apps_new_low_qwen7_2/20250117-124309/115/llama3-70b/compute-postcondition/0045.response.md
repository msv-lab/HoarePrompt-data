Given the initial state: `i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, and the conditions specified for `ops`, let's analyze the code:

1. The conditions for `ops` to contain the coordinate \((2, m-1)\) are:
   - \(A[2][m-1] == 1\)
   - \(A[3][m-1] == 1\)
   - \(A[2][m] == 1\)
   - \(A[3][m] == 1\)

2. The if condition checks if any of the following are true:
   - \(A[i][j] == 1\)
   - \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\)
   - \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\)
   - \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\)

Since the if condition is true (as per the problem statement), `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` will be executed.

3. Since \(i\) is 2 and \(j\) is \(m - 1\):
   - \(i + 1\) is 3
   - \(j + 1\) is \(m\)

Therefore, `ops.append((3, m))`.

The value of `ops` will now be \([(3, m)]\).

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` is \([(3, m)]\)**
