`ops` is a list that contains tuples representing operations. Initially, `ops` contains one tuple `(1, 1)`. The code appends a new tuple to `ops`, which is `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the new tuple becomes `(0 + 1, 1 + 1)`, which simplifies to `(1, 2)`. Therefore, the updated `ops` will be `[ (1, 1), (1, 2) ]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` and `m` must satisfy 2 <= n, m <= 50, `A` is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is `[ (1, 1), (1, 2) ]`**
