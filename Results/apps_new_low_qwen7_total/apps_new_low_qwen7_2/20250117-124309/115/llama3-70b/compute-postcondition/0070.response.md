Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer starting from 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration of the outer loop, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains the coordinates of all cells \((k, k+1)\) for \(k\) from `i - 1` to `n - 2` (provided at least one of the conditions \(A[k][k+1] == 1\) or \(A[k+1][k+2] == 1\) is true for those coordinates), if no such cells exist, `ops` remains an empty list, and the loop continues to append the next coordinate to `ops` until no more valid cells are found, and finally, `i` reaches `n - 1`. If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the printed value is the last printed tuple (if any).***
