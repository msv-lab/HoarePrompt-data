The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The variables `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, `A`, and `ops` retain their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` and `m` must satisfy 2 <= n, m <= 50, `A` is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is `[ (1, 1) ]` if at least one of the following conditions is true: `A[0][0] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j] == 1` or `A[i][j + 1] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, otherwise `ops` remains an empty list.**
