The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `ops` is an empty list. Therefore, `ops` will be updated to contain the tuple `(1, 1)`. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` and `m` must satisfy 2 <= n, m <= 50, `A` is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is `[ (1, 1) ]`, and at least one of the following conditions is true: `A[0][0] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j] == 1` or `A[i][j + 1] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`.**
