The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` and does not affect the values of any variables. The outer loop and the operations on `ops` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the outer loop, `j` increments to `m - 1` and then to `m` as the inner loop completes, `ops` contains the coordinates of all cells \((k, k+1)\) for \(k\) from `i - 1` to `n - 2`, provided that at least one of the conditions \(A[k][k+1] == 1\) or \(A[k+1][k+2] == 1\) is true for those coordinates, if no such cells exist, `ops` remains an empty list, and the loop continues to append the next coordinate to `ops` until no more valid cells are found, and finally, `i` reaches `n - 1`, and the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, and `-1` is printed.**
