Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies `j` as the iterating variable, and it ranges from `0` to `m - 2`. Therefore, the only variable being iterated over in this loop is `j`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is `m`.
   - `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\).
   - `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
   - `ops` is a list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` from `0` to `m - 2`. This means `j` will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `m - 2`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `m`. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become `m + 1`.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged, as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` and `m` also remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `A` and `ops` remain unchanged as well, as no operations on them are specified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is a list.**
