Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` and `m` must satisfy 2 <= n, m <= 50, `A` is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is `[ (1, 1), (1, 2) ]`. This is true if any of the following conditions are met: `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`.***
