The `continue` statement in the given code does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if it's inside a loop) and moves on to the next iteration. Since no loop context is provided, we assume this statement is outside any loop and thus does not affect any variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `m` must satisfy 2 <= n, m <= 50, `A` is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list, `j` is 0, and the condition A[0][0] == 1 and A[1][0] == 1 and A[0][1] == 1 and A[1][1] == 1 is true**
