The code snippet appends the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `j` is \(m - 1\). Since \(A[i][j] == 1\) and \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) and \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) and \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\), the coordinates \((3, m)\) are already in `ops`. After appending \((i + 1, j + 1)\), the new coordinate \((3, m)\) is added again to `ops`. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains the coordinates \((3, m)\) and \((4, m)\); the length of `ops` is 2.**
