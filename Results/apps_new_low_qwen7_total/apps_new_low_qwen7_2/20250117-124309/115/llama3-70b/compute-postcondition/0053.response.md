The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Given the initial state and the fact that no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1; `ops` contains the coordinate \((3, m)\) because the condition \(A[i][j] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) or \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) is met.**
