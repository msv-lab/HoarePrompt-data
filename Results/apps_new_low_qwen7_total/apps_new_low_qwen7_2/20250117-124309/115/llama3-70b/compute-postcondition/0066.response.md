The code `print(op[0], op[1])` prints the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` but does not change the values of any variables. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, `A`, and `ops` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a non-empty list, and the printed value is `op[0]` and `op[1]`.**
