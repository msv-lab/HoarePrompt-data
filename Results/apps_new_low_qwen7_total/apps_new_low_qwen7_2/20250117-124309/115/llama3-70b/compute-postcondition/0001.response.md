Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `n` and `m` are integers with `2 <= n, m <= 50`.
   - `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
   - `ops` is an empty list.

2. **Understand the For Loop Statement:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n - 2`, inclusive. This means the loop variable `i` will take values from `0` to `n - 2`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the First Execution of the Loop:**
   - The loop will execute the first time when `i = 0`.
   - The condition `i in range(n - 1)` will evaluate to `True` if `i` is within the range `[0, n - 2]`.

4. **Check the State of Variables Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop does not directly depend on `n` or `m` for its first execution; it only needs `i` to be within the specified range.
   - The matrix `A` and the list `ops` are not directly involved in the loop condition but could affect the loop body.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the value of `i` must be `0`.
   - There is no specific requirement for `n` or `m` to change for the first iteration, as long as `n` is at least 2 (since `2 <= n, m <= 50`).

Thus, the required state before the first execution of the loop is:
- `i` must be `0`.
- `n` and `m` must satisfy `2 <= n, m <= 50` (though this does not change for the first iteration).
- `A` remains an `n x m` matrix with elements being either 0 or 1.
- `ops` remains an empty list.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `m` must satisfy 2 <= n, m <= 50, `A` is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list**
