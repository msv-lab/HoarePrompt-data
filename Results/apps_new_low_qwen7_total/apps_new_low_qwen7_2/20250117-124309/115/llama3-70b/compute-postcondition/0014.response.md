Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables:**
   The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2` because `range(m - 1)` generates values from 0 to `m-2`.

3. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\).
   - `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
   - `ops` is `[ (1, 1), (1, 2) ]`.

4. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition for `j` is `j < m - 1`. Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented.

5. **Update the State:**
   - `i` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `j = 2`.
   - The constraints on `n` and `m` remain the same.
   - The matrix `A` remains unchanged.
   - The list `ops` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is `[ (1, 1), (1, 2) ]`.**
