The code snippet appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` are 1 and `m` respectively from the initial state. After executing the code, the list `ops` will contain the new tuple.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(2, 2)`.**
