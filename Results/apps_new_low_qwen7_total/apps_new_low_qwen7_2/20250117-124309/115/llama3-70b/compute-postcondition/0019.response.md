Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m-1`, `n` and `m` must satisfy 2 <= n, m <= 50, `A` is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` contains all coordinates `(1, j)` for `j` from `0` to `m-1` if any of the conditions in the if statement are true for those coordinates. Otherwise, `ops` remains an empty list.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-2` (inclusive).
   - For each `j`, it checks if any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are true.
   - If the conditions are true, the loop continues without appending anything to `ops`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` starts at `0` and remains `0` throughout the loop because the loop only changes `j`.
   - `j` increases from `0` to `m-2` (inclusive).
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.
   - `A` is unchanged unless the conditions are true, but the problem specifies that `A` remains an n x m matrix with elements either `0` or `1`.
   - `ops` is appended with `(i + 1, j + 1)` if any of the conditions are true for the current `j`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will always be `0` since the loop does not modify it.
   - `j` will be `m-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `m-2`, and `m-1` is the last value `j` can take before the loop ends.
   - `n` and `m` remain as provided in the initial state.
   - `A` remains unchanged unless the conditions are true, but based on the problem statement, `A` is left as an n x m matrix of 0s and 1s.
   - `ops` will contain all coordinates `(1, j)` for `j` from `0` to `m-1` if any of the conditions are true for those coordinates. Otherwise, `ops` remains an empty list.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The final state of `i` being `0` is consistent with the initial state and the loop's behavior.
   - The final value of `j` being `m-1` is correct because the loop runs up to `m-2`, inclusive.
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged as expected.
   - The behavior of `ops` is consistent with the described iterations, ensuring that all conditions for `ops`'s inclusion are correctly tracked.
