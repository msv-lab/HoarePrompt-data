Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1. If at least one of the conditions \(A[2][m-1] == 1\), \(A[3][m-1] == 1\), \(A[2][m] == 1\), or \(A[3][m] == 1\) is true, then `ops` contains the coordinate \((3, m)\); otherwise, `ops` remains an empty list.**
