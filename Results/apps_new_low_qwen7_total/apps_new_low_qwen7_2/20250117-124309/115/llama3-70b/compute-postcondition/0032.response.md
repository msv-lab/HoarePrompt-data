Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is a list. If the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, then these four elements remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the matrix `A` and other variables remains as per the precondition.***
