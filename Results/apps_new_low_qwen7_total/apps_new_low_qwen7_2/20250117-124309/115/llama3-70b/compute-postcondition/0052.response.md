State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1; `ops` contains the coordinate \((3, m)\) because the condition \(A[i][j] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) or \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) is met.** 

Explanation:
- The loop starts with `j = m`.
- The loop runs from `j` in the range `range(m - 1)`, meaning `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `m`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `m - 1`.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to `m - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` remains 2,
- `j` changes to `m - 1`,
- `n` and `m` remain within the bounds \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\),
- `A` remains an \(n \times m\) matrix with elements being 0 or 1,
- `ops` contains the coordinate \((3, m)\) because the condition is still met.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1; `ops` contains the coordinate \((3, m)\) because the condition \(A[i][j] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) or \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) is met.**
