The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this context, there is no loop, so the `continue` statement does not change the current state of the variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1; `ops` remains an empty list.**
