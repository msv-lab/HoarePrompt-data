Let's analyze the given code and the initial state step-by-step.

### Initial State
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is `m`
- `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\)
- `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is an empty list
- The printed value is 0

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the elements of the `ops` list and prints each element as a tuple `(op[0], op[1])`.

### Observations from Given Output States
- After the loop executes 1 time, `ops` is a non-empty list, and it prints the first element of `ops` as a tuple `(op[0], op[1])`.
- After the loop executes 2 times, `ops` is a non-empty list, and it prints the second element of `ops` as a tuple `(op[0], op[1])`.
- After the loop executes 3 times, `ops` is a non-empty list, and it prints the third element of `ops` as a tuple `(op[0], op[1])`.

From this, we can infer that the loop will continue to print elements from the `ops` list until there are no more elements left to print.

### Invariants and Variables
- **Invariant**: The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `m` remain constant throughout the loop.
- **Variables changing**: The length of `ops` changes as the loop progresses. Initially, `ops` is empty, and after each iteration, one element is added to `ops`.

### Final State
Since the loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in `ops`, the final state will be when `ops` becomes an empty list after all its elements have been printed. 

Therefore, after the loop finishes executing all iterations:
- `i` remains `n - 1`
- `j` remains `m`
- `n` and `m` remain within the range \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\)
- `A` remains an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` becomes an empty list
- The printed value will be the last printed tuple, but since `ops` is now empty, no further printing occurs.

### Conclusion
Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list, and the printed value is the last printed tuple (if any).**
