You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: $n$ and $m$ are integers such that $2 \le n, m \le 50$, and $A$ is a $n \times m$ matrix where each element is either $0$ or $1$.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][
                j + 1] == 1:
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1
                ] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1. After the loop completes all its iterations, `ops` will contain the coordinates of all cells \((k, k+1)\) for \(k\) from \(i - 1\) to \(n - 2\), provided that at least one of the conditions \(A[k][k+1] == 1\) or \(A[k+1][k+2] == 1\) is true for those coordinates. If no such cells exist, `ops` will remain an empty list. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the outer loop, while `j` increments to `m - 1` and then to `m` as the inner loop completes. The loop continues to append the next coordinate to `ops` until no more valid cells are found, and finally, `i` reaches `n - 1`.
    if (len(ops) > 2500) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list, and the printed value is the last printed tuple (if any).
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is an integer starting from 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration of the outer loop, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains the coordinates of all cells \((k, k+1)\) for \(k\) from `i - 1` to `n - 2` (provided at least one of the conditions \(A[k][k+1] == 1\) or \(A[k+1][k+2] == 1\) is true for those coordinates), if no such cells exist, `ops` remains an empty list, and the loop continues to append the next coordinate to `ops` until no more valid cells are found, and finally, `i` reaches `n - 1`. If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the printed value is the last printed tuple (if any).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes an \( n \times m \) matrix \( A \) where each element is either 0 or 1, and returns some unspecified information about the matrix.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
