To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given information and the structure of the for loop.

### Analysis:

- **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over the `ops` list using the variable `op`.
- **Initial State**:
  - `i` is `n - 1`
  - `j` is `m`
  - `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\)
  - `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
  - `ops` is an empty list
  - The printed value is 0

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop `for op in ops:` will execute as long as `ops` contains at least one element.
   - Since `ops` is initially empty (`[]`), the loop will not execute even once because there are no elements to iterate over.

2. **Modifying the Initial State**:
   - To make the loop execute at least once, we need to ensure that `ops` is not empty.
   - Therefore, we need to add at least one element to the `ops` list.

### Final State:

- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is `m`
- `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\)
- `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a non-empty list (at least one element)
- The printed value is 0

### Conclusion:

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a non-empty list, and the printed value is 0**.
