Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head in the given for loop statement is `for op in ops:`. The only variable in the loop head is `op`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one element (which it does, as it is mentioned that `ops` is a non-empty list).

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `j` is `m`
   - `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\)
   - `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
   - `ops` is a non-empty list
   - The printed value is `op[0]` and `op[1]`

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop iterates over the elements in `ops`, the only variable that needs adjustment is `op`. In the next iteration, `op` will be the next element in the list `ops`.
   - Therefore, `op` will change to the next element in the list `ops`.

### Final State

Given that the loop continues as long as there are elements in `ops`, the only thing that changes is the current element being processed by `op`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a non-empty list (with one less element than before), and the printed value is `op[0]` and `op[1]`**.
