Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list, and if the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i+1][j]\), \(A[i][j+1]\), and \(A[i+1][j+1]\) are all equal to 1, no changes are made to the matrix and `ops` remains as an empty list.***
