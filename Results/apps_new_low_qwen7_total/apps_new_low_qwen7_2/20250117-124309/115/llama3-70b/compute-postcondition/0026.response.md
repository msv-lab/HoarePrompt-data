The code appends a tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 1 and the value of `j` is `m - 1`. Therefore, `i + 1` is 2 and `j + 1` is `m`. The list `ops` was initially empty, so after appending the tuple, it contains \((2, m)\).

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing \((2, m)\), and at least one of the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i + 1][j]\), \(A[i][j + 1]\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1]\) is equal to 1.**
