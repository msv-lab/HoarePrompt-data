`i` remains unchanged at 0. If `A[0][2] == 1` and `A[1][2] == 1` and (`A[0][3] == 1`) and (`A[1][3] == 1`), then `j` becomes 3. Otherwise, `j` remains 2. The constraints on `n` and `m` remain the same. The matrix `A` remains unchanged. The list `ops` is updated by appending `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

Since the conditions for `j` are not specified in the initial state, we consider both cases:

1. If `A[0][2] == 1` and `A[1][2] == 1` and (`A[0][3] == 1`) and (`A[1][3] == 1`), then `j` becomes 3.
2. Otherwise, `j` remains 2.

In both cases, `i` remains 0. The value of `i + 1` is 1, and `j + 1` is either 4 (if `j` is 3) or 3 (if `j` is 2).

Therefore, the output state is:
- `i` is 0
- `j` is either 3 or 4
- `ops` is updated to include `(1, 4)` if `j` is 3, or `(1, 3)` if `j` is 2

Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is either 3 or 4; `ops` includes either `(1, 4)` or `(1, 3)`**
