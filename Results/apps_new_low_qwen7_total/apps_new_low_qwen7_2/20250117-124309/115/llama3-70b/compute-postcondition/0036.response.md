The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `i` is 1 and `j` is `m + 1`. Therefore, the tuple added to `ops` will be `(2, m + 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list with an additional element `(2, m + 2)`.**
