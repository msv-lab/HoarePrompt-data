The `continue` statement in the provided code does not change the values of any variables or affect the conditions under which `ops` is defined. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop (which is not explicitly shown here). Since there is no loop to break from or continue through, and no other changes to the variables, the state of the variables remains the same.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the coordinate \((2, j)\) since \(A[2][m-1] == 1\) and the adjacent elements \(A[2][m], A[3][m-1], A[3][m]\) also equal 1, otherwise `ops` remains an empty list**
