The code `print(op[0], op[1])` simply prints the first and second elements of the list `op`. No variables are assigned new values in this line of code. Therefore, the only information that changes from the initial state is the output of the print statement, which is `op[0]` and `op[1]`.

Given the initial state, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`, `n` and `m` satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a non-empty list, and the printed value is `op[0]` and `op[1]`.**
