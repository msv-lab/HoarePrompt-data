Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Information:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is `m-1`
- `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\)
- `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` contains all coordinates \((1, j)\) for \(j\) from `0` to `m-1` if any of the conditions in the if statement are true for those coordinates. Otherwise, `ops` remains an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < m - 1`.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: The initial value of `j` is `m - 1`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `j < m - 1` must not be satisfied, because `j` starts at `m - 1`. This means that the loop should not execute at all given the initial value of `j`.

However, since the problem asks us to think about the state required for the loop to execute the first time, we need to consider what would be necessary for the loop to start executing, even though it will not in this specific case due to the initial value.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial value of `j` is `m - 1`, the loop will not execute the first time. Therefore, no adjustments to the states of the variables are necessary to make the loop execute the first time under the given initial conditions.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `n` and `m` must satisfy \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\), `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list** (since `j` is already `m-1` and the loop won't execute).
