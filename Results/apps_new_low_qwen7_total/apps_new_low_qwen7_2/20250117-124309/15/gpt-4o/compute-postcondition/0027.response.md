To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the condition inside the `while` loop: `stack and stack[-1] < num`.

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition checks two things:
     1. `stack` is not empty (`stack` is truthy).
     2. The last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `p` is a non-empty list of `k-2` integers.
   - `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`.
   - If `num` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (returns None).

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions of the `while` loop must be satisfied.
   - `stack` must not be empty.
   - The last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) must be less than `num`.

Given that `p` is a non-empty list of `k-2` integers, `p` is equivalent to `stack` since `stack` is derived from `p`. Therefore, `stack` is non-empty.

4. **Final Requirement**:
   - We need to ensure that the last element of `stack` (which is `num`) is less than some value. Since `num` is the last element of `p`, we need to make sure `num` is less than the last element of `stack` for the loop to execute.

Since `num` is the last element of `p` and `p` is equivalent to `stack`, we need to ensure `num` is less than the last element of `stack`.

Therefore, the final state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k-2` integers, `num` is the last element of the updated list `p` and `num` must be less than the last element of `stack`**.
