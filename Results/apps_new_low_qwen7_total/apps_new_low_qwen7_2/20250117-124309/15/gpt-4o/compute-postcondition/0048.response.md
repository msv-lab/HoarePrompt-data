The code `result.append(stack.pop())` has the following impacts:
- It pops an element from `stack` and appends it to `result`.
- Since `p` is an empty list, it remains unchanged.
- `stack` loses one element, which is the last element of the original `stack` plus `num`.
- `remaining_numbers` has one less element, so it now has `remaining_numbers - 1` elements.
- `max_seen` retains its last updated value, so it remains unchanged.
- `num` must be greater than the last element of the original `stack`, and since it was popped, it is no longer in `stack`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is an empty list, `result` contains the last element of the original `stack`, `stack` is the original stack minus its last element, `remaining_numbers` has one less element, `max_seen` retains its last updated value, and `num` must be greater than the last element of the original `stack`.

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` is the last element of the original `stack`, `stack` is the original stack minus its last element, `remaining_numbers` has one less element, `max_seen` retains its last updated value, and `num` must be greater than the last element of the original `stack`.**
