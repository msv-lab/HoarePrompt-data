The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. The value of `max_seen` is now the previous last element of `stack`. The state of `total` and `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k-2` integers, `num` is the last element of the updated list `p` and `num` must be less than the last element of `stack`, `max_seen` is the last element of the previous `stack`**
