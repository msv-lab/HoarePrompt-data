The code `stack.append(num)` appends the value of `num` to the list `stack`. Given the initial state:

- `stack` contains the elements of `p` in the order they were processed.
- `remaining_numbers` is a list containing at least one element.
- `num` is initially set to the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
- `max_seen` retains its last updated value.

After executing `stack.append(num)`:

- The value of `num` is added to the end of the `stack` list.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `p` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `result` is unchanged.
- `stack` now contains all elements from the original `stack` plus the new element `num`.
- `remaining_numbers` is unchanged.
- `max_seen` retains its last updated value (unchanged).

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, result is unchanged, stack is the original stack plus `num`, remaining_numbers is unchanged, max_seen retains its last updated value.**
