To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states step by step.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while stack and stack[-1] < num:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty and the top element of `stack` (i.e., `stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

### Given States
- `p` is an empty list
- `result` must contain at least one less element
- `stack` must contain at least one less element
- `remaining_numbers` is an empty list
- `max_seen` is equal to the previous top element of `stack`

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `stack` must not be empty (`stack` is not empty).
   - The top element of `stack` must be less than `num` (`stack[-1] < num`).

2. **Current States**:
   - `p` is empty.
   - `result` contains at least one less element.
   - `stack` contains at least one less element.
   - `remaining_numbers` is empty.
   - `max_seen` is the previous top element of `stack`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `p` is empty and `remaining_numbers` is empty, they do not affect the loop condition.
   - `result` contains at least one less element, but this is not relevant to the loop condition.
   - `max_seen` is already set correctly based on the previous top element of `stack`.
   - For the loop to continue, `stack` must contain at least one element, and the top element of `stack` must be less than `num`.

Since `stack` is required to be non-empty and the top element must be less than `num`, we need to ensure these conditions are met before the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `stack` contains at least one element and the top element of `stack` is less than `num`.

### Final Answer
State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` must contain at least one less element, `stack` must contain at least one element and its top element must be less than `num`, `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, and `max_seen` is equal to the previous top element of `stack`**.
