`result` appends the value popped from `stack`. Since `stack` contains at least one element that is less than `num`, the value popped from `stack` will be one of those elements. The value of `remaining_numbers` and `max_seen` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `p` is an empty list, `result` is `[num, stack's last element]`, `stack` is missing its last element (which was less than `num`), `remaining_numbers` must be greater than 0, `max_seen` retains its last updated value.

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` is `[num, stack's last element]`, `stack` is missing its last element (which was less than `num`), `remaining_numbers` must be greater than 0, `max_seen` retains its last updated value**
