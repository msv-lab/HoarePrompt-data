Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop is iterating over `remaining_numbers` using `num`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `num` and `remaining_numbers`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `remaining_numbers`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `p` is an empty list, `result` is unchanged, `stack` is the original stack plus `num`, `remaining_numbers` is unchanged, and `max_seen` retains its last updated value.

3. **Adjust the states:**
   - Since `num` is taken from `remaining_numbers` in each iteration, after the previous iteration, `remaining_numbers` should have one less element (assuming the loop has processed one element).
   - The other variables (`p`, `result`, `stack`, and `max_seen`) remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`p` is an empty list, result is unchanged, stack is the original stack plus num, remaining_numbers is a list with one less element than before, max_seen retains its last updated value**.

However, to fit the required format, we can summarize it as:

State: **`p` is an empty list, result is unchanged, stack is the original stack plus num, remaining_numbers has one less element, max_seen retains its last updated value**.
