`max_seen` is assigned the value of the top element of `stack` and then that element is popped from `stack`. Since the top element of `stack` was less than `num`, `max_seen` now holds that value, and `stack` no longer contains that element.

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` must contain at least one less element, `stack` must contain at least one element (with the top element being greater than or equal to `max_seen`), `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, and `max_seen` is equal to the previous top element of `stack` which is now the new max seen value.**
