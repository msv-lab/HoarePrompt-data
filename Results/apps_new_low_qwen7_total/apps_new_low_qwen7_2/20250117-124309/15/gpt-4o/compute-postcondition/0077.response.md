Initial State: `p` is an empty list, `result` must contain at least one element, `stack` is empty, `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `max_seen` retains its last updated value, and `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.

Code Snippet:
```python
stack.append(num)
```

Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `p` is an empty list.
   - `result` must contain at least one element.
   - `stack` is empty.
   - `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
   - `max_seen` retains its last updated value.
   - `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.

2. **Effect of the Code**:
   - The line `stack.append(num)` appends the value of `num` to the `stack`.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - `p` remains an empty list.
   - `result` remains unchanged and contains at least one element.
   - `stack` now contains the value of `num` (since `num` is appended to it).
   - `remaining_numbers` remains an empty list.
   - `max_seen` retains its last updated value.
   - `num` remains unchanged.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` must contain at least one element, `stack` contains the value `num`, `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, and `max_seen` retains its last updated value.**
