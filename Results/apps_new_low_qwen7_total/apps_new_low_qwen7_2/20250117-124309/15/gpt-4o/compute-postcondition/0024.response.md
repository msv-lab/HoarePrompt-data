Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `p` is a non-empty list of `k-1` integers
   - `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`
   - `stack` is a list containing `num`
   - `max_seen` is the last element of the original `stack` before it became empty

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for num in p:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `p`.
   - Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `p`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`.
   - For the loop to continue, `p` should now contain `k-2` elements (since one element has already been processed).
   - `num` will be the new last element of this updated `p`.

5. **New States After the Next Iteration:**
   - `p` will have one less element, so it will now be a list of `k-2` integers.
   - `num` will be the last element of this new `p`.

6. **Other States Remain Unchanged:**
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `stack` will be updated based on the value of `num`, but since we are only asked to adjust the states from the loop head, we focus on `p` and `num`.
   - `max_seen` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k-2` integers, `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`**
