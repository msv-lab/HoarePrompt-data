Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`. This means the loop will continue as long as `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `num`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `p` is an empty list.
   - `result` is `[num, stack's last element]`.
   - `stack` is missing its last element (which was less than `num`).
   - `remaining_numbers` must be greater than 0.
   - `max_seen` retains its last updated value.

3. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop condition involves `stack` and `stack[-1] < num`, we need to ensure these conditions are met for the next iteration.
   - `stack` is missing its last element, which implies that the last element was popped out during the current iteration. For the loop to execute again, `stack` must have at least one element and the last element must be less than `num`.
   - `remaining_numbers` being greater than 0 is not directly related to the loop condition but ensures there are still numbers to process, so this state should remain unchanged.
   - `max_seen` retaining its last updated value is also not directly related to the loop condition, so this state should remain unchanged.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Ensure `stack` has at least one element and the last element is less than `num`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `stack` must have at least one element, and the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` is `[num, stack's last element]`, `stack` must have at least one element and the last element must be less than `num`, `remaining_numbers` must be greater than 0, `max_seen` retains its last updated value**
