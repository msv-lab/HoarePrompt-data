Let's analyze the given code and the provided information step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\) and \(1 \leq k < n\).
   - `p` is a list of `k` integers representing the first `k` elements of a permutation of size `n`. These integers are pairwise distinct and lie in the range \([1, n]\).
   - `stack` is an empty list.
   - `max_seen` is `0`.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `p`.
   - For each `num`, it checks if `num < max_seen`. If true, it returns `-1`.
   - If `num >= max_seen`, it enters a while loop that pops elements from `stack` as long as the top of `stack` is less than `num`. After popping, it updates `max_seen` to the popped value.
   - Finally, it appends `num` to `stack`.

3. **Output States**:
   - **After 1 iteration**:
     - `total` is `0`.
     - `p` is a non-empty list of `k` integers.
     - `num` is the last element of the list `p`.
     - `stack` contains the elements that were popped during the loop iterations plus `num`.
     - `max_seen` is the maximum value among the elements that were popped from `stack`.
   - **After 2 iterations**:
     - `total` is `0`.
     - `p` is a non-empty list of `k-1` integers.
     - `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`.
     - `stack` is a list containing `num`.
     - `max_seen` is the last element of the original `stack` before it became empty.
   - **After 3 iterations**:
     - `total` is `0`.
     - `p` is an empty list.
     - `num` is undefined.
     - `stack` is `[num]`.

### Summary of Loop Behavior

- The loop continues to execute until all elements in `p` have been processed.
- `max_seen` is updated to ensure it always holds the maximum value seen so far that was popped from `stack`.
- `stack` accumulates elements that meet the condition `num >= max_seen`.

### Final Output State

- **When the loop completes**:
  - All elements in `p` have been processed.
  - `p` becomes an empty list since all its elements have been processed and removed from the loop.
  - `num` is undefined because there are no more elements left in `p`.
  - `stack` contains the elements that were popped during the loop iterations, which would be the elements of `p` in reverse order if none were popped (since `num` would be appended directly).

### Final Output State Calculation

Given the behavior of the loop, the final state after processing all elements in `p` will be:

- `p` is an empty list.
- `num` is undefined.
- `stack` contains the elements of `p` in the order they were processed.
- `max_seen` retains its last updated value.

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `num` is undefined, `stack` contains the elements of `p` in the order they were processed, and `max_seen` retains its last updated value.**
