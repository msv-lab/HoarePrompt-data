The code `stack.append(num)` appends the current value of `num` to the list `stack`. Since `num` is the last element of the list `p`, the new value of `stack` will include this element.

Let's summarize the changes:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total` is 0.
   - `p` is a non-empty list of `k` integers.
   - `num` is the last element of the list `p`.
   - `stack` contains the elements that were popped during the loop iterations.
   - `max_seen` is the maximum value among the elements that were popped from `stack`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - `num` is appended to `stack`.
   - No other variables are affected.

3. **Final State**:
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `p` remains a non-empty list of `k` integers.
   - `num` remains the last element of the list `p`.
   - `stack` now includes the new element `num`.
   - `max_seen` remains the maximum value among the elements that were popped from `stack` during the loop.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k` integers, `num` is the last element of the list `p`, `stack` contains the elements that were popped during the loop iterations plus `num`, and `max_seen` is the maximum value among the elements that were popped from `stack`.**
