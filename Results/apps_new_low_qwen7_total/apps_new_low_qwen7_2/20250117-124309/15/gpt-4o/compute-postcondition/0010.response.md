`max_seen` is assigned the value of the last element of `stack`, which is less than `num`. The last element of `stack` is removed (popped) from the stack. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k` integers, `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `stack` is not empty, the last element of `stack` is less than `num`, and `max_seen` is the last element of `stack` before it was popped.**
