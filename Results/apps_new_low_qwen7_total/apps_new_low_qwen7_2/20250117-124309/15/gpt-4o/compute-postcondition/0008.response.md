`max_seen` is assigned the value of the element that was popped from `stack`. Since the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`, the value of `max_seen` is equal to the last element of `stack`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k` integers, `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `stack` does not contain the element that was popped (less than `num`), the last element of `stack` is now `max_seen`, and `max_seen` is the value of the element that was popped from `stack`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k` integers, `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `stack` does not contain the element that was popped (less than `num`), the last element of `stack` is `max_seen`, and `max_seen` is the value of the element that was popped from `stack`**.
