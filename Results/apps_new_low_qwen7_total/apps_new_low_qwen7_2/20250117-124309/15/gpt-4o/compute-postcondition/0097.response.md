`max_seen` is assigned the value of `stack.pop()`, which removes and returns the last element of `stack`. Therefore, `max_seen` now holds the value of the last element of `stack` before it was popped. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` has no elements left, `stack` is not empty (but `max_seen` now holds the last element that was in `stack` before popping), `max_seen` is the last element of `stack` before popping, `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, and `num` must be greater than `max_seen`**
