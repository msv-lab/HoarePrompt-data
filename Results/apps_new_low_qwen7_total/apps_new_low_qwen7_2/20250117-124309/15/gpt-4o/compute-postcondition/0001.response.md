Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop control variables and objects involved:**
   - The loop is iterating over the elements of the list `p`.
   - The primary loop control variable is `num`, which takes the value of each element from the list `p` during each iteration.

2. **Determine the initial state of the objects before the loop:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\) and \(1 \leq k < n\).
   - `p` is a list of `k` integers representing the first `k` elements of a permutation of size `n`, where these integers are pairwise distinct and lie in the range \([1, n]\).
   - `stack` is an empty list.
   - `max_seen` is 0.

3. **Determine what must hold true for the loop to execute:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the list `p` must contain at least one element.
   - Since `p` is a list containing `k` elements, and `k` is a positive integer (as per the given conditions), `p` will always contain at least one element.
   - The loop variable `num` will take the value of the first element in the list `p`.

4. **Formulate the required state for the loop head:**
   - The list `p` must not be empty (which it won't be, since it contains `k` elements).
   - The variable `num` should be set to the first element of the list `p`.

Given this analysis, the required state for the loop head is as follows:

**State: **`p` is a non-empty list of `k` integers, `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `stack` is an empty list, `max_seen` is 0**
