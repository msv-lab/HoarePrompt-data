To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the loop condition `stack and stack[-1] < num`.

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `stack` is not empty (`stack`) and the last element of `stack` is less than `num` (`stack[-1] < num`).

2. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `total` is 0: This is irrelevant to the loop condition.
   - `p` is a non-empty list of `k-1` integers: This ensures that `p` exists but doesn't directly affect the loop condition.
   - `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`: This means `num` is a valid integer and could be the last element of `p`.
   - `stack` contains the elements that were popped during this iteration plus `num`: This indicates that `stack` is a list containing some elements.
   - `max_seen` is the maximum value among the elements in the updated `stack`: This is used to check the condition within the loop but does not affect the loop's entry.

3. **Loop Entry Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `stack` must not be empty (`stack`).
   - Additionally, the last element of `stack` must be less than `num` (`stack[-1] < num`).

Given that `stack` is non-empty due to containing elements (either popped from another source or added during this iteration plus `num`), the critical condition for the loop to execute is that the last element of `stack` should be less than `num`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute the first time, `num` must be greater than the last element of `stack`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k-1` integers, `num` is the last element of the updated list `p` and must be greater than the last element of `stack`, `stack` contains the elements that were popped during this iteration plus `num`, and `max_seen` is the maximum value among the elements in the updated `stack`.**
