The given code snippet initializes two variables: `stack` which is an empty list, and `max_seen` which is set to 0. There are no assignments or operations performed on these variables within the provided code block. Therefore, the values of `stack` and `max_seen` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\) and \(1 \leq k < n\).
- `p` is a list of `k` integers representing the first `k` elements of a permutation of size `n`, where these integers are pairwise distinct and lie in the range \([1, n]\).

Since no changes are made to `n`, `k`, or `p` in the provided code, their values remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000 and 1 ≤ k < n, p is a list of k integers representing the first k elements of a permutation of size n, where these integers are pairwise distinct and lie in the range [1, n], stack is an empty list, max_seen is 0**
