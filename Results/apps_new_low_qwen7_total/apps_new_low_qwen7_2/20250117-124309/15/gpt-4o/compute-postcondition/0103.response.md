Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `p`. Here, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\) and \(1 \leq k < n\). `p` is a list of `k` integers representing the first `k` elements of a permutation of size `n`, where these integers are pairwise distinct and lie in the range \([1, n]\).

After executing the function, the following states are possible:
1. If at any point during the execution, a number in `p` is found to be less than `max_seen`, the function immediately returns -1.
2. Otherwise, the function constructs a new list `result` by appending numbers from the remaining elements of the permutation in descending order, ensuring that the resulting list is a valid permutation of size `n`. This is achieved by maintaining a stack to keep track of the next greater elements and appending them to `result` in the correct order.
3. After constructing `result`, the function verifies that no element in `result` is less than `max_seen`. If this condition is violated, the function returns -1; otherwise, it returns the empty list `result`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where `p` is not a valid permutation of size `k`. However, the function ensures that if `p` is invalid, it returns -1.
- The function does not explicitly check if `p` is a permutation of size `k` before proceeding with the construction of `result`. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `p` is not a valid permutation.
- The function assumes that the remaining numbers in the permutation are available and can be used to construct `result`. If `p` contains all elements from 1 to `k`, the function will return -1 because there are no remaining numbers to form a valid permutation.**

Therefore, the function `func_1` either returns -1 if any condition violates the requirements for a valid permutation or returns an empty list `result` if a valid permutation can be constructed.
