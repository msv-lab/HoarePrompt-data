The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. Since `stack` originally contained elements that were popped during the iteration plus `num`, and `num` is the last element of the updated `p`, the last element of `stack` before popping is `num`. After popping, the `stack` loses its last element, which is `num`.

Therefore, the new value of `max_seen` is `num`, and the `stack` no longer contains `num`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k-1` integers, `num` is the last element of the updated list `p` and must be greater than the last element of `stack`, `stack` does not contain `num`, and `max_seen` is equal to `num`.**
