Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty (`stack`) and the last element of `stack` is less than `num` (`stack[-1] < num`).

2. **Current state**: 
   - `total` is 0
   - `p` is a non-empty list of `k` integers
   - `num` is the first element of the list `p`
   - `stack` does not contain the element that was popped (less than `num`)
   - `max_seen` is the value of the element that was popped from `stack`

3. **Loop execution requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
   - `stack` should not be empty.
   - The last element of `stack` should be less than `num`.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since `stack` is not empty, the condition `stack` is already satisfied.
   - We need to ensure that the last element of `stack` is less than `num`.

5. **Ensuring the loop can execute one more time**:
   - Since `num` is the first element of the list `p`, we know that `num` is an integer.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`.

6. **Final state**:
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `p` remains a non-empty list of `k` integers.
   - `num` is the first element of the list `p`.
   - `stack` does not contain the element that was popped (less than `num`), but now the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`.
   - `max_seen` is the value of the element that was popped from `stack`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the last element of `stack` to be less than `num`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k` integers, `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `stack` does not contain the element that was popped (less than `num`), the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`, `max_seen` is the value of the element that was popped from `stack`**.
