Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` has no elements left, `stack` is empty, `max_seen` is the largest number that was in `stack` before the loop starts (or -1 if `stack` was empty), `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The initial state is given where `p` is an empty list, `result` has no elements left, `stack` contains `[num]`, `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, and `num` is less than `max_seen` results in an immediate return of -1. Otherwise, the loop can start.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **`p`**: Remains an empty list because there is no code modifying it within the loop.
   - **`result`**: Also remains unchanged as it is not involved in any operations within the loop.
   - **`stack`**: This is modified by the loop through `stack.pop()`. The loop continues until `stack` is empty or `stack[-1]` is not less than `num`.
   - **`max_seen`**: Updated with the value of `stack.pop()` each time the condition `stack and stack[-1] < num` is met. The final value of `max_seen` will be the last element that was in `stack` before the loop terminates.
   - **`remaining_numbers`**: Remains an empty list because there is no code adding to or modifying this list within the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop runs while `stack` is not empty and the top element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.
   - Each iteration of the loop pops the top element from `stack` and updates `max_seen` with this value.
   - The loop stops when `stack` becomes empty or the top element of `stack` is no longer less than `num`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After the loop, `stack` is empty.
   - `max_seen` is set to the largest value that was popped from `stack` during the loop, ensuring that `max_seen` is the largest element that was in `stack` before the loop started or -1 if `stack` was empty.
   - `p` and `result` remain unchanged and are both empty lists.
   - `remaining_numbers` remains empty.

Thus, the final output state is: **`p` is an empty list, `result` has no elements left, `stack` is empty, `max_seen` is the largest number that was in `stack` before the loop starts (or -1 if `stack` was empty), `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.**
