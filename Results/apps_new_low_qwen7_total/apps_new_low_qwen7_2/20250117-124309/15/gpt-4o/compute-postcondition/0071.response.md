`max_seen` is assigned the value of the element popped from the `stack`. The value of `max_seen` is now the last element of the `stack`. The `stack` loses its last element, and the `remaining_numbers` and `p` lists remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is an empty list, `result` must contain at least one element, `stack` has lost its last element (which is now in `max_seen`), `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, and `max_seen` retains its last updated value.

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` must contain at least one element, `stack` has lost its last element (which is now in `max_seen`), `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, and `max_seen` retains its last updated value.**
