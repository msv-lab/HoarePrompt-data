Output State: **p is an empty list, result contains all elements from the stack in reverse order, stack is empty, remaining_numbers is an empty list, and max_seen retains its last updated value**.

Explanation:
- The first line `result.extend(reversed(stack))` appends all elements of the reversed stack to the result list. Since the stack is initially empty, the result list remains empty.
- The second line `stack = []` empties the stack, which it already is.
- The third line `max_seen = 0` updates the value of `max_seen` to 0, assuming `max_seen` was previously set to some value that is now replaced by 0. However, since the initial state did not specify an initial value for `max_seen`, we assume it retains its last updated value, which is 0 after this operation.

Thus, the final state includes the updated or unchanged values of the variables as described.
