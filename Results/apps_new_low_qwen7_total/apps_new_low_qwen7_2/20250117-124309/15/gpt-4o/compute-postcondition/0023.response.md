The code appends the value of `num` to the `stack`. Since `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`, the `stack` becomes a list containing this single element `num`. The other variables (`total`, `p`, `max_seen`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k-1` integers, `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`, `stack` is a list containing `num`, and `max_seen` is the last element of the original `stack` before it became empty.**
