`max_seen` is assigned the value of the last element in `stack`, which is popped off the stack. The value of `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`, and the conditions about `num` and `max_seen` are preserved.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k-2` integers, `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`, `max_seen` is the last element of `stack` before popping, and the last element of `stack` is now `max_seen`.**
