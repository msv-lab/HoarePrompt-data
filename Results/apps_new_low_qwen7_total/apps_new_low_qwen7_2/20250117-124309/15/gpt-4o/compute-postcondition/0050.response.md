The code snippet `result.append(stack.pop())` has the following impacts:

- `stack.pop()` removes and returns the last element of `stack`.
- This returned value is appended to `result`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `p` is an empty list.
- `result` is the last element of the original `stack`.
- `stack` should not be empty and the last element of `stack` should be less than `num`.
- `remaining_numbers` has one less element.
- `max_seen` retains its last updated value.
- `num` must be greater than the last element of the original `stack`.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `stack` is popped and appended to `result`.
- Since `result` was originally the last element of `stack`, after appending, `result` will contain this last element twice (the first being the original value).

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `stack` is now one element shorter.
- `result` contains the last element of the original `stack` twice.

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` is the last element of the original `stack` twice, `stack` is one element shorter, `remaining_numbers` has one less element, `max_seen` retains its last updated value, and `num` must be greater than the last element of the original `stack`.**
