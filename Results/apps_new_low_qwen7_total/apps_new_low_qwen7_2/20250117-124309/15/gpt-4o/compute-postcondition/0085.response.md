To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while stack and stack[-1] < num:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to continue executing, two conditions must be met:
1. `stack` must not be empty (`stack` should exist).
2. The top element of the stack (`stack[-1]`) must be less than `num`.

### Current State
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `p` is an empty list.
- `result` must contain at least one less element.
- `stack` must contain at least one element (with the top element being greater than or equal to `max_seen`).
- `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
- `max_seen` is equal to the previous top element of `stack` which is now the new `max_seen` value.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **`stack` must not be empty**: This is already satisfied as per the given state.
2. **`stack[-1] < num`**: This condition determines whether the loop continues. For the loop to continue, the top element of `stack` must be less than `num`.

Given that `stack` contains at least one element and the top element is greater than or equal to `max_seen`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is related to `num`. Specifically, `num` must be such that `stack[-1] < num`.

### Adjusted State
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `num`. `num` must be greater than the top element of `stack`.

State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` must contain at least one less element, `stack` must contain at least one element (with the top element being greater than or equal to `max_seen`), `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, and `num` must be greater than the top element of `stack`.**
