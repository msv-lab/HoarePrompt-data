`max_seen` is assigned the value popped from the `stack`. The `stack` originally contained `[less_than_num]`, so after popping, `max_seen` will be `less_than_num` and the `stack` will be empty. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` has no elements left, `stack` is an empty list, `max_seen` is `less_than_num`, `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.**
