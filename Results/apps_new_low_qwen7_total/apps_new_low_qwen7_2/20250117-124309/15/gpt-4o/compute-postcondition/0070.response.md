Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`.

2. **Current State Before Loop:**
   - `p` is an empty list.
   - `result` must contain at least one element.
   - `stack` is empty.
   - `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
   - `max_seen` retains its last updated value.
   - `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `stack` must not be empty, and `stack[-1]` must be less than `num`.

4. **Current State Check:**
   - `stack` is currently empty (`stack == []`).

5. **Required State Change:**
   - To satisfy the loop condition, `stack` must not be empty. Therefore, `stack` must contain at least one element.

6. **Other State Considerations:**
   - The value of `num` being greater than or equal to `max_seen` is irrelevant to the current check since the loop condition is solely based on `stack` and `stack[-1]`.

### Conclusion:
To make the loop execute the first time, we need to ensure that `stack` is not empty, i.e., `stack` must contain at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` must contain at least one element, `stack` must contain at least one element, `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, and `max_seen` retains its last updated value, and the number `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.**
