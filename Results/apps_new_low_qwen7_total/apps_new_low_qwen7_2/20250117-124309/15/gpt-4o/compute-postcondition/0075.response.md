The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. The value of `max_seen` before the pop operation is the last element of `stack`, and after the pop operation, `max_seen` takes this value, while the `stack` loses its last element.

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` must contain at least one element, `stack` does not contain the last element which was `max_seen` before the pop operation, `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `max_seen` is the value of the last element of `stack` before the pop operation, and `num` must be greater than `max_seen`.**
