To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `while stack and stack[-1] < num:`. For this loop to continue executing, both conditions inside the `and` operator must be true:

1. `stack` must not be empty (`stack` is not `[]`).
2. The last element of `stack` must be less than `num` (`stack[-1] < num`).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `p` is an empty list.
- `result` must contain at least one element.
- `stack` has lost its last element (which is now in `max_seen`).
- `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
- `max_seen` retains its last updated value.

Let's break down the adjustments needed:

1. **`stack` must not be empty**: Since `stack` has lost its last element, it could either be empty or contain other elements. For the loop to continue, `stack` must not be empty. Therefore, `stack` should retain at least one element.
   
2. **`stack[-1] < num`**: For this condition to be true, the last element of `stack` (now stored in `max_seen`) must be less than the current `num`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `stack` must not be empty.
- The last element of `stack` (which is now in `max_seen`) must be less than the current `num`.

State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` must contain at least one element, `stack` must not be empty and the last element of `stack` (which is now in `max_seen`) must be less than the current `num`, `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, and `max_seen` retains its last updated value.**
