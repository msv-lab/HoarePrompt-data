Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of `k-1` integers, `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`, `stack` contains the elements that were popped during this iteration plus `num`, and `max_seen` is the maximum value among the elements in the updated `stack`. If `num` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function continues with the updated `stack` and `max_seen` without returning anything.***
