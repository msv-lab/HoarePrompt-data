The code `stack.append(num)` appends the value of `num` to the list `stack`. However, since `num` is undefined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is an empty list, `num` is undefined, and `stack` is `[num]`**
