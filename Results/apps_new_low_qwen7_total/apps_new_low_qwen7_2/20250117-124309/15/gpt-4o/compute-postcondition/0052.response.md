The code `result.append(stack.pop())` affects the variables `result` and `stack`. 

- `stack.pop()` removes and returns the last element of `stack`. Since `stack` was one element shorter before this operation, it now has two elements less than its original length.
- `result.append(stack.pop())` appends this removed element to `result`.

Given the initial state:
- `p` is an empty list,
- `result` is the last element of the original `stack` twice,
- `stack` is one element shorter,
- `remaining_numbers` has one less element,
- `max_seen` retains its last updated value,
- `num` must be greater than the last element of the original `stack`.

After executing the code:
- `stack` loses another element (so it is now two elements shorter than its original length),
- `result` gains the last element of the now-shorter `stack` (which was the second-to-last element of the original `stack`).

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `p` is an empty list,
- `result` is the second-to-last element of the original `stack` twice,
- `stack` is two elements shorter,
- `remaining_numbers` has two less elements,
- `max_seen` retains its last updated value,
- `num` must be greater than the last element of the original `stack`.

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` is the second-to-last element of the original `stack` twice, `stack` is two elements shorter, `remaining_numbers` has two less elements, `max_seen` retains its last updated value, and `num` must be greater than the last element of the original `stack`.**
