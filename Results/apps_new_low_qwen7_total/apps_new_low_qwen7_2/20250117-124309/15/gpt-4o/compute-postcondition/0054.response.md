`stack` appends the value of `num` to itself. Since `num` must be greater than or equal to the largest element in the original `stack`, which is currently empty, `num` is non-empty and appended to an initially empty `stack`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` contains the elements popped from the stack in decreasing order, `stack` is [num], `remaining_numbers` is 0, `max_seen` retains its last updated value, and `num` must be greater than or equal to the largest element in the original `stack`.**
