`max_seen` is assigned the value of `stack.pop()`. Since `stack` is not empty and has one less element after popping, `max_seen` takes the value of `stack[-1]`, which was less than `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0; `p` is a non-empty list of \( k-1 \) integers; `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`; `stack` is not empty (with one less element); `max_seen` is equal to `stack[-1]`.
