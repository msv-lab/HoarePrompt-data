`max_seen` is assigned the value of `stack.pop()`. Since `stack` is not empty and `stack[-1] < num`, the last element of `stack` is popped and assigned to `max_seen`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` has no elements left, `stack` is not empty, `max_seen` is the last element of `stack` before popping, `remaining_numbers` is an empty list**
