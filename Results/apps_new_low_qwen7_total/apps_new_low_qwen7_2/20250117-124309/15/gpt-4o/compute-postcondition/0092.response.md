Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `p` is an empty list.
- `result` has no elements left.
- `stack` is `[num]`.
- `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
- If `num` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while stack and stack[-1] < num:`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute as long as `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

### Current State Before the Loop:
- `stack` is `[num]`.

### Determining the First Execution:
- For the loop to execute the first time, `stack` must be non-empty, which it is.
- Additionally, the condition `stack[-1] < num` must be true. Since `stack[-1]` is `num`, this condition cannot be true because `num` is not less than `num`.

### Adjustment Needed:
Since `stack[-1]` is `num` and we need `stack[-1] < num` for the loop to execute, there is no way to satisfy this condition based on the given initial state. Therefore, we need to adjust the initial state such that the last element of `stack` is less than `num`.

### New State:
To make the loop execute the first time, we need to ensure that the last element of `stack` is less than `num`. One possible adjustment could be to set `num` to a value less than the current value stored in `stack`.

However, since `num` is defined as being less than `max_seen` would cause the function to return -1, we cannot directly set `num` to be less than itself. Instead, we can adjust `stack` to contain a different value that is less than `num`.

### Final State:
State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` has no elements left, `stack` is [less_than_num], `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.**

Here, `less_than_num` should be any value less than `num` to satisfy the loop condition `stack[-1] < num`.
