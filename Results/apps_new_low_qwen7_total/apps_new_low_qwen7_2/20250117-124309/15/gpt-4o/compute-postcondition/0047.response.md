To determine the conditions under which the loop will execute at least once, we need to focus on the variables that control the loop's continuation, which are `stack` and `num`.

1. The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`.
2. For the loop to execute, both parts of the condition need to be true:
   - `stack` must not be empty.
   - The last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) must be less than `num`.

Given the initial state:
- `p` is an empty list.
- `result` is unchanged.
- `stack` is the original stack plus `num`.
- `remaining_numbers` has one less element.
- `max_seen` retains its last updated value.

For the loop to execute the first time:
- `stack` should not be empty. Since `stack` is initially the original stack plus `num`, it is not empty as long as the original stack was not empty and `num` was added to it.
- The last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) should be less than `num`.

Since `stack` is the original stack plus `num`, we need to ensure that `num` is greater than the last element of the original stack. If `num` is not greater than the last element of the original stack, the loop will not execute even if `stack` is not empty.

Therefore, the only condition we need to adjust is ensuring that `num` is greater than the last element of the original stack.

State: **`p` is an empty list, `result` is unchanged, `stack` is the original stack plus `num`, `remaining_numbers` has one less element, `max_seen` retains its last updated value, and `num` must be greater than the last element of the original stack**.
