`max_seen` is assigned the value of `stack.pop()`. Since `stack` is not empty, `stack.pop()` removes and returns the last element of `stack`. The value of `max_seen` was previously equal to the last element of `p`, which is now removed from `stack`. The state of `total` and `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of k-1 integers, `num` is the last element of the updated list `p`, `stack` is not empty (with one less element), `max_seen` is equal to the last element of the original `stack` before popping.**
