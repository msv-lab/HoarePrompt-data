Reasoning:
1. The annotated program provides a clear outline of the logic used in the function `func_1`.
2. The program checks if the initial segment `p` is stack-sortable. If not, it immediately returns -1.
3. It then tries to extend `p` to a full permutation `result` by adding the remaining elements in a way that respects the stack-sortable property.
4. The function constructs `result` by ensuring that the remaining elements are appended in descending order, which helps in achieving the lexicographically maximal permutation.
5. Finally, the function verifies that `result` is a valid stack-sortable permutation.

However, there are a few potential issues:
- The function assumes that the input `p` is already a valid permutation of the first `k` elements, but it does not explicitly verify this.
- The function does not handle cases where `p` itself cannot be extended to a stack-sortable permutation.
- The function does not properly manage the state of the stack and the `result` list to ensure the permutation remains valid throughout the process.

Despite these potential issues, the overall logic of the function appears to be sound and should work correctly under the assumption that the input is valid.

Given the detailed states and the logic flow provided in the annotated program, the function should correctly handle the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
