### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and evaluate it against the problem description and the annotated code.

#### 1. Reading Input and Initial Setup:
- The program correctly reads the input and splits it into `n`, `k`, and the initial `k` elements of the permutation `p`.
- It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

#### 2. Function `func_1`:
- The function starts by initializing an empty stack and `max_seen` to 0.
- It iterates through the elements of `p` and checks if the current element `num` is less than `max_seen`. If it is, the function immediately returns `-1`, indicating the permutation is not stack-sortable.
- It uses a stack to simulate the stack operations and updates `max_seen` accordingly.
- After processing `p`, it constructs the remaining elements of the permutation using the largest available numbers in descending order.
- It appends these elements to the `result` list and reverses the stack to get the remaining elements in the correct order.
- Finally, it verifies the constructed `result` to ensure it is stack-sortable by iterating through it again.

#### Verification:
- The function handles the stack-sortability check correctly.
- It constructs the remaining part of the permutation in a way that ensures lexicographical maximality.
- It verifies the final permutation to ensure it remains stack-sortable.

#### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling:** The function does not explicitly check if `p` is a permutation of size `k` before proceeding. However, the problem guarantees valid inputs, so this is not a critical issue.
- **Verification Step:** The final verification step is crucial but might be redundant if the earlier steps already ensured stack-sortability.

#### Detailed Analysis Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code provides a clear breakdown of the states at different points in the function.
- The first loop correctly checks stack-sortability and updates the stack and `max_seen`.
- The construction of the remaining part of the permutation ensures lexicographical maximality.
- The final verification step re-checks the stack-sortability of the entire permutation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the stack-sortability check, constructs the remaining part of the permutation in a lexicographically maximal way, and verifies the final permutation.

**Final: True**
