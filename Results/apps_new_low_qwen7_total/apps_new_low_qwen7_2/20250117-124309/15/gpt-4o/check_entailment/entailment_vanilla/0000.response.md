Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the solution step-by-step and ensure it adheres to the problem description.

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into parts, correctly extracting `n`, `k`, and the initial `k` elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function first checks if the given `p` is stack-sortable.
   - It uses a stack to simulate the operations and keeps track of the maximum value seen (`max_seen`) to ensure the stack-sortability condition is met.
   - If at any point a value in `p` is less than `max_seen`, it returns `-1` indicating the permutation cannot be stack-sortable.
   - After checking, it constructs the remaining part of the permutation using the largest available numbers (to ensure lexicographical maximality).
   - Finally, it constructs the full permutation and verifies it again to ensure it remains stack-sortable throughout.

3. **Verification:**
   - The program logic appears to handle all necessary steps:
     - Ensuring the initial part is stack-sortable.
     - Adding the remaining elements in a way that maintains stack-sortability.
     - Verifying the final permutation is stack-sortable.

Given the detailed breakdown, the provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
