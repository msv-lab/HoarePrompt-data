Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine whether a given sequence `p` (the first `k` elements of a permutation) can be extended to a stack-sortable permutation of size `n`. The approach taken in the `func_1` function seems fundamentally sound, but let's break down the key aspects and verify its correctness:

1. **Initial Validation**:
   - The function checks if any number in `p` is less than `max_seen` at any point. If so, it returns `-1`. This correctly identifies invalid sequences.
   - It also uses a stack to ensure the order of elements and to verify the correctness of the constructed permutation.

2. **Remaining Numbers Handling**:
   - The function calculates the remaining numbers that need to be placed in the permutation (`remaining_numbers`). These are sorted in descending order to maximize the lexicographical order of the final permutation.
   - It then constructs the full permutation by appending these remaining numbers and ensuring the stack order is maintained.

3. **Final Verification**:
   - After constructing the permutation, the function verifies again using the stack that no element is less than `max_seen`. If this verification fails, it returns `-1`.

### Potential Issues:
- The initial validation (checking if any number in `p` is less than `max_seen`) is correct.
- Constructing the permutation by appending remaining numbers in descending order and ensuring the stack order is maintained is correct.
- The final verification step is necessary and correct.

### Edge Cases:
- The function correctly handles cases where `p` cannot be extended to a valid stack-sortable permutation.
- It correctly ensures the lexicographical maximality by appending remaining numbers in descending order.

### Conclusion:
Given the logical flow and the handling of edge cases, the provided program appears to be correct. The function `func_1` correctly determines whether a given sequence can be extended to a stack-sortable permutation and constructs the lexicographically maximal one if possible.

Correctness: **True**
