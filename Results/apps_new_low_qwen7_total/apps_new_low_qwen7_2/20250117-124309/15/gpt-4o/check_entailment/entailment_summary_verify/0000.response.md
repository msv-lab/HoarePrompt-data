### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to validate its correctness based on the given problem description and function summary.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to determine if a given permutation can be extended to a stack-sortable permutation.
- If possible, we should return the lexicographically maximal such permutation.
- If not possible, we should return -1.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` takes `n`, `k`, and `p` as input.
- It checks if the initial `k` elements can be part of a stack-sortable permutation.
- If they cannot, it returns -1.
- Otherwise, it extends the permutation using the remaining numbers in descending order, ensuring the stack-sortable property is maintained.

#### Key Points:
1. **Checking Initial Elements**: The function checks if the initial `k` elements are in a stack-sortable order. If not, it returns -1.
2. **Constructing Remaining Permutation**: The function constructs the remaining part of the permutation by appending numbers in descending order, ensuring the stack-sortable property is maintained.
3. **Verification**: The function verifies the entire constructed permutation to ensure it is stack-sortable.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial Check**:
   - The function correctly checks if the initial `k` elements are in a stack-sortable order.
   - If not, it returns -1, which aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Constructing Remaining Permutation**:
   - The function correctly uses the remaining numbers in descending order to construct the permutation.
   - It ensures that the stack-sortable property is maintained by using a stack to manage the order of elements.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function verifies the entire constructed permutation to ensure it is stack-sortable.
   - If the verification fails, it returns -1, ensuring the output is correct.

Given the detailed analysis and the function summary, the program appears to be handling all necessary checks and constructions correctly. There are no edge cases mentioned in the original assessment that the program does not address. The function ensures that the initial elements are checked, the remaining elements are added in the correct order, and the final permutation is verified.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the stack-sortable property is maintained throughout the process. However, the provided function summary and detailed analysis show that the program indeed maintains the stack-sortable property correctly.

**Final: True**

The program is correct based on the given problem description and function summary.
