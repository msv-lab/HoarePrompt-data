### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and splits it into `n`, `k`, and the initial `k` elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Checking Stack-Sortability:**
     - The function first checks if the given `p` is stack-sortable by simulating the stack operations and maintaining a `max_seen` variable.
     - If at any point a value in `p` is less than `max_seen`, it immediately returns `-1`.
   - **Constructing the Remaining Part of the Permutation:**
     - The function identifies the remaining numbers that are not in `p` and sorts them in descending order.
     - It constructs the result list by appending these numbers in the correct order, ensuring that the stack operations remain valid.
   - **Final Verification:**
     - After constructing the result list, the function verifies that the entire list is stack-sortable by re-simulating the stack operations.

#### Potential Issues:

1. **Handling of Invalid Permutations:**
   - The function does not explicitly check if `p` is a valid permutation of size `k` before proceeding with the construction of `result`.
   - If `p` is not a valid permutation, the function might return an incorrect result.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `p` contains all elements from 1 to `k`, the function will return `-1` because there are no remaining numbers to form a valid permutation.
   - However, the function should also handle cases where the initial part of `p` is not stack-sortable but can be made so by adding the remaining numbers.

3. **Stack-Sortability Check:**
   - The function performs a stack sort check twice: once during the construction of `result` and again after constructing `result`.
   - This redundancy might be unnecessary and could lead to inefficiencies.

#### Detailed Verification:

1. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The function should include a check to ensure `p` is a valid permutation of size `k`. If not, it should return `-1`.

2. **Correctness of Stack-Sortability:**
   - The function correctly simulates the stack operations and maintains `max_seen` to ensure stack-sortability.
   - However, it should only perform the verification once after constructing the full permutation.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If `p` contains all elements from 1 to `k`, the function should handle this case correctly by returning `-1`.

#### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a permutation is stack-sortable and constructs the lexicographically maximal permutation if possible. The potential issues mentioned do not significantly impact the overall correctness of the solution.
