### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the annotated version to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### 1. Reading Input and Initial Setup:
- The program correctly reads the input and extracts `n`, `k`, and the initial `k` elements of the permutation `p`.
- It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

#### 2. Function `func_1`:
- **Stack Sortability Check:**
  - The function initializes an empty stack and a variable `max_seen` to keep track of the maximum value encountered so far.
  - For each number in `p`, it checks if the number is less than `max_seen`. If it is, the function returns `-1` immediately because the permutation cannot be stack-sortable.
  - Otherwise, it pops elements from the stack and updates `max_seen` if necessary, ensuring the stack remains in the correct order.
  - If all numbers in `p` pass the stack sortability check, the function proceeds to construct the remaining part of the permutation.

- **Constructing the Remaining Part:**
  - The function creates a set of all numbers from `1` to `n` that are not in `p`.
  - It sorts this set in descending order to ensure the lexicographically maximal permutation.
  - It then appends these numbers to `p` while maintaining the stack sortability condition.
  - Finally, it reverses the stack and appends its contents to `p`.

- **Final Verification:**
  - The function constructs the full permutation and performs a final check to ensure it is stack-sortable.

#### Systematic Evaluation Using Annotations:

1. **Before Function Call:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers with appropriate ranges.
   - `p` is a list of `k` distinct integers from `1` to `n`.

2. **After Initial Stack Sortability Check:**
   - `p` is checked for stack sortability.
   - If any number in `p` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the stack and `max_seen` are updated accordingly.

3. **Constructing Remaining Part:**
   - The remaining numbers are determined and sorted in descending order.
   - These numbers are appended to `p` while maintaining stack sortability.
   - The stack is reversed and appended to `p`.

4. **Final Verification:**
   - The constructed permutation is verified one last time to ensure it is stack-sortable.
   - If successful, the permutation is returned; otherwise, `-1` is returned.

#### Verification Against Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `5 3 3 2 1`
  - Expected Output: `3 2 1 5 4`
  - The program correctly identifies that `[3, 2, 1]` is stack-sortable and appends the remaining numbers in descending order.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `5 3 2 3 1`
  - Expected Output: `-1`
  - The program correctly identifies that the given sequence cannot be extended to form a stack-sortable permutation.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `5 1 3`
  - Expected Output: `3 2 1 5 4`
  - The program correctly identifies that `[3]` is stack-sortable and appends the remaining numbers in descending order.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `5 2 3 4`
  - Expected Output: `-1`
  - The program correctly identifies that the given sequence cannot be extended to form a stack-sortable permutation.

Based on the detailed analysis and examples, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.
