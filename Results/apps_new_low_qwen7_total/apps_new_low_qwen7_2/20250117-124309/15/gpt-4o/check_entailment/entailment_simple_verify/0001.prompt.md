You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's suppose you have an array a, a stack s (initially empty) and an array b (also initially empty).

You may perform the following operations until both a and s are empty:

  Take the first element of a, push it into s and remove it from a (if a is not empty);  Take the top element from s, append it to the end of array b and remove it from s (if s is not empty). 

You can perform these operations in arbitrary order.

If there exists a way to perform the operations such that array b is sorted in non-descending order in the end, then array a is called stack-sortable.

For example, [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable, because b will be sorted if we perform the following operations:

  Remove 3 from a and push it into s;  Remove 1 from a and push it into s;  Remove 1 from s and append it to the end of b;  Remove 2 from a and push it into s;  Remove 2 from s and append it to the end of b;  Remove 3 from s and append it to the end of b. 

After all these operations b = [1, 2, 3], so [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable. [2, 3, 1] is not stack-sortable.

You are given k first elements of some permutation p of size n (recall that a permutation of size n is an array of size n where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once). You have to restore the remaining n - k elements of this permutation so it is stack-sortable. If there are multiple answers, choose the answer such that p is lexicographically maximal (an array q is lexicographically greater than an array p iff there exists some integer k such that for every i < k q_{i} = p_{i}, and q_{k} > p_{k}). You may not swap or change any of first k elements of the permutation.

Print the lexicographically maximal permutation p you can obtain.

If there exists no answer then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, 1 ≤ k < n) — the size of a desired permutation, and the number of elements you are given, respectively.

The second line contains k integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the first k elements of p. These integers are pairwise distinct.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to restore a stack-sortable permutation p of size n such that the first k elements of p are equal to elements given in the input, print lexicographically maximal such permutation.

Otherwise print -1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the solution step-by-step and ensure it adheres to the problem description.

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into parts, correctly extracting `n`, `k`, and the initial `k` elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function first checks if the given `p` is stack-sortable.
   - It uses a stack to simulate the operations and keeps track of the maximum value seen (`max_seen`) to ensure the stack-sortability condition is met.
   - If at any point a value in `p` is less than `max_seen`, it returns `-1` indicating the permutation cannot be stack-sortable.
   - After checking, it constructs the remaining part of the permutation using the largest available numbers (to ensure lexicographical maximality).
   - Finally, it constructs the full permutation and verifies it again to ensure it remains stack-sortable throughout.

3. **Verification:**
   - The program logic appears to handle all necessary steps:
     - Ensuring the initial part is stack-sortable.
     - Adding the remaining elements in a way that maintains stack-sortability.
     - Verifying the final permutation is stack-sortable.

Given the detailed breakdown, the provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as per the problem statement.
