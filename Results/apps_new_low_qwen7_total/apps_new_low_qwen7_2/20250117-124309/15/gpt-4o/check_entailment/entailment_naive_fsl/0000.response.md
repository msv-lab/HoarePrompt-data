Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the restored part of the permutation is stack-sortable after the initial k elements are processed. 

Consider the input:
```
5 2
3 4
```

The program attempts to restore the remaining elements to make the permutation stack-sortable. However, it incorrectly appends the remaining elements without ensuring that the stack-sortable property is maintained throughout the process. This leads to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.

For instance, the program might generate an output like `3 4 2 1 5`, which is not stack-sortable. A correct approach would involve carefully managing the stack and ensuring that the appended elements maintain the stack-sortable property. The current implementation does not guarantee this, hence the program is incorrect.
