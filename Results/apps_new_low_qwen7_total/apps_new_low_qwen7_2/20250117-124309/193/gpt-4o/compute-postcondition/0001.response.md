The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, based on the constraints, it seems there might be implied parameters `x` and `y` that should be part of the function signature but are not explicitly listed. Given the constraints, `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`.

Output:
Case_1: The function does not return anything (returns None).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept implicitly two parameters `x` and `y` where `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`, and if no explicit return statement is present, it returns None.

Functionality: **The function accepts implicitly two parameters `x` and `y` where `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`, and returns `None`.**
