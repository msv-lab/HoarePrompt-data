The initial state is that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). 

The code snippet provided is:
```
x, y = map(int, input().split())
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

This code first takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. Then, it prints the result of the expression \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\).

Let's break down the expression:
- \(x - y\) computes the difference between `x` and `y`.
- \((x - y) // 2\) computes the integer division of the difference by 2, which means it gives the quotient when \(x - y\) is divided by 2.
- \((x - y) \% 2\) computes the remainder when \(x - y\) is divided by 2.

The expression \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\) essentially checks if \(x - y\) is even or odd:
- If \(x - y\) is even, then \((x - y) \% 2 = 0\) and the expression evaluates to \((x - y) // 2 + 0 = (x - y) // 2\).
- If \(x - y\) is odd, then \((x - y) \% 2 = 1\) and the expression evaluates to \((x - y) // 2 + 1\).

Since \(x\) and \(y\) are integers and \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\), the difference \(x - y\) will always be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, \(x - y\) can either be even or odd, but the expression \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\) will always evaluate to the ceiling of \(\frac{x - y}{2}\).

For example, if \(x = 10\) and \(y = 3\), then \(x - y = 7\), and the expression evaluates to \(\left\lceil \frac{7}{2} \right\rceil = 4\).

Given the general nature of the problem, without specific values for \(x\) and \(y\), we can state that the final output will be the ceiling of half of the difference between \(x\) and \(y\).

Therefore, the output state after running the code is:
Output State: **(x is an integer, y is an integer, the printed value is the ceiling of half of the difference between x and y)**
