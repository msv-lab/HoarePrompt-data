Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the solution. The key part is the expression \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\), which essentially computes the minimum number of steps required to reduce the side length from \(x\) to \(y\) while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate at every step.

Here's the detailed breakdown:
- To reduce the side length from \(x\) to \(y\), we need to decrease the side length by \(x - y\).
- Each operation can reduce one side by at most 1, but since we are dealing with an equilateral triangle, all three sides must be adjusted simultaneously to maintain the triangle property.
- The minimum number of operations required to reduce the side length from \(x\) to \(y\) is \(\frac{x - y}{2}\) when \(x - y\) is even, or \(\frac{x - y + 1}{2}\) when \(x - y\) is odd. This is because in each step, we can adjust one side by 1, and to keep the triangle property, we effectively need to make two such adjustments simultaneously (since reducing one side would force the others to also change).

Given this, the provided solution accurately calculates the minimum number of steps using the formula \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\), which is mathematically equivalent to the logic described above.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
