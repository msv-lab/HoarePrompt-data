You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.

- Program: 
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000.
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())

print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of seconds needed to transform an equilateral triangle with side length `x` into an equilateral triangle with side length `y`, where each transformation involves changing the length of one side to ensure the resulting shape remains a non-degenerate triangle. The key point is that the length of each side must remain an integer and form a valid triangle at all times.

The provided solution uses the formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` to compute the number of seconds. Let's analyze this formula step-by-step:

1. **`(x - y)`**: This represents the total reduction in side length from `x` to `y`.
2. **`(x - y) // 2`**: This computes the integer division of the total reduction by 2. It gives the number of full "halves" of reductions possible.
3. **`(x - y) % 2`**: This computes the remainder after the integer division. If there is any remainder, it means there is an additional step needed to reach the exact side length `y`.

The logic here is that you can reduce the side length in steps of 1, but every two reductions can be considered as one step towards reducing the difference. However, if there is a remainder, you need one additional step to reach the exact value.

Given this understanding, let's verify the examples provided:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `x = 6`, `y = 3`
  - Calculation: `(6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Expected Output: `4` (The expected output is actually 4, not 2)
  - Explanation: The correct sequence would be: \( (6,6,6) \rightarrow (6,5,6) \rightarrow (5,5,6) \rightarrow (5,5,5) \rightarrow (3,5,5) \rightarrow (3,3,5) \rightarrow (3,3,3) \), which takes 4 steps.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `x = 8`, `y = 5`
  - Calculation: `(8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Expected Output: `3` (The expected output is actually 3)
  - Explanation: The correct sequence would be: \( (8,8,8) \rightarrow (8,8,5) \rightarrow (8,5,5) \rightarrow (5,5,5) \), which takes 3 steps.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `x = 22`, `y = 4`
  - Calculation: `(22 - 4) // 2 + (22 - 4) % 2 = 18 // 2 + 18 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9`
  - Expected Output: `6` (The expected output is actually 6)
  - Explanation: The correct sequence would be: \( (22,22,22) \rightarrow (7,22,22) \rightarrow (7,22,16) \rightarrow (7,10,16) \rightarrow (7,10,4) \rightarrow (7,4,4) \rightarrow (4,4,4) \), which takes 6 steps.

From the above analysis, it is clear that the provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required for the transformation.
