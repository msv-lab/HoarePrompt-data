### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into an equilateral triangle of side length `y` using the minimum number of seconds.
   - Each second, we can change the length of one side of the triangle to a new value that maintains the triangle inequality (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side).
   - The side lengths must remain integers at all times.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Since the triangle must always be valid and equilateral, the shortest path to achieve this would involve reducing the side length from `x` to `y`.
   - Given that `y < x`, we need to decrease the side length from `x` to `y` by making valid changes each second.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy involves reducing one side at a time to the target length `y`.
   - We need to reduce `x` to `y` by making changes to one side per second.
   - To ensure the triangle inequality holds, we can make the reduction steps as follows:
     - Decrease `x` to `y` directly in steps where each step reduces the side by 1 until reaching `y`.

4. **Calculating Minimum Steps**:
   - The number of steps required to reduce `x` to `y` is simply `x - y`.
   - This is because each step reduces the side length by 1, and we need to reduce it from `x` to `y`.

5. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code reads `x` and `y` from input and calculates `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`.
   - This expression simplifies to `x - y` because:
     - `(x - y) // 2` is the integer division which truncates the result.
     - `(x - y) % 2` is the remainder when `x - y` is divided by 2, which will be 0 if `x - y` is even and 1 if `x - y` is odd.
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to `x - y`.

### Conclusion:

The given code correctly computes the minimum number of seconds required to transform the equilateral triangle of side length `x` to side length `y`. Thus, the provided solution is correct.

### Correctness:
