### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of seconds needed to transform an equilateral triangle with side length `x` into an equilateral triangle with side length `y`, where each transformation involves changing the length of one side to ensure the resulting shape remains a non-degenerate triangle. The key point is that the length of each side must remain an integer and form a valid triangle at all times.

The provided solution uses the formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` to compute the number of seconds. Let's analyze this formula step-by-step:

1. **`(x - y)`**: This represents the total reduction in side length from `x` to `y`.
2. **`(x - y) // 2`**: This computes the integer division of the total reduction by 2. It gives the number of full "halves" of reductions possible.
3. **`(x - y) % 2`**: This computes the remainder after the integer division. If there is any remainder, it means there is an additional step needed to reach the exact side length `y`.

The logic here is that you can reduce the side length in steps of 1, but every two reductions can be considered as one step towards reducing the difference. However, if there is a remainder, you need one additional step to reach the exact value.

Given this understanding, let's verify the examples provided:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `x = 6`, `y = 3`
  - Calculation: `(6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Expected Output: `4` (The expected output is actually 4, not 2)
  - Explanation: The correct sequence would be: \( (6,6,6) \rightarrow (6,5,6) \rightarrow (5,5,6) \rightarrow (5,5,5) \rightarrow (3,5,5) \rightarrow (3,3,5) \rightarrow (3,3,3) \), which takes 4 steps.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `x = 8`, `y = 5`
  - Calculation: `(8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Expected Output: `3` (The expected output is actually 3)
  - Explanation: The correct sequence would be: \( (8,8,8) \rightarrow (8,8,5) \rightarrow (8,5,5) \rightarrow (5,5,5) \), which takes 3 steps.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `x = 22`, `y = 4`
  - Calculation: `(22 - 4) // 2 + (22 - 4) % 2 = 18 // 2 + 18 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9`
  - Expected Output: `6` (The expected output is actually 6)
  - Explanation: The correct sequence would be: \( (22,22,22) \rightarrow (7,22,22) \rightarrow (7,22,16) \rightarrow (7,10,16) \rightarrow (7,10,4) \rightarrow (7,4,4) \rightarrow (4,4,4) \), which takes 6 steps.

From the above analysis, it is clear that the provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required for the transformation.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: False**
