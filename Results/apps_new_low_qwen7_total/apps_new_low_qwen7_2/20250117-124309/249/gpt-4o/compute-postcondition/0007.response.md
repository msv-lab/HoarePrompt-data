Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `2 * max_diff + 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < 2 * max_diff + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `prefix_sum[3]` is equal to `(prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD`.

4. **Adjust the State for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 1, making it `i = 4`.
   - The condition `i < 2 * max_diff + 1` must still hold true. Therefore, `2 * max_diff + 1` remains unchanged.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `t` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged).
   - `prefix_sum` remains the same list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `prefix_sum[3]` remains `(prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD` (unchanged).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros; `i` is 4; `prefix_sum[3]` is (`prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD`**
