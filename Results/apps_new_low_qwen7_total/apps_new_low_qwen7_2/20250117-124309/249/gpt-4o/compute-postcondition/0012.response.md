The only variables in the loop head are `i`, so we can only adjust this one variable. According to the loop statement, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * max_diff + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `2 * max_diff + 1` is a constant value determined by the maximum difference `max_diff`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's denote the current value of `max_diff` as \( \text{max\_diff} \). The condition for the next iteration is:
\[ i < 2 * \text{max\_diff} + 1 \]

Given that `i` is currently 1, the smallest possible value for `max_diff` would be 1 (since if `max_diff` were 0, `2 * 0 + 1 = 1`, and the loop would stop immediately).

For the loop to execute one more time:
\[ 1 < 2 * \text{max\_diff} + 1 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 0 < 2 * \text{max\_diff} \]
Which is always true for positive `max_diff`.

Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.

The states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 5, `dp_curr` is a list where the first element is (prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD, and `prefix_sum` remains unchanged**
