The code updates the `prefix_sum` list by setting `prefix_sum[i + 1]` to `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`. Here, `i` is initially 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with all elements set to 0, `dp_prev` holds the original value of `dp_curr`, and `dp_curr` holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with all elements set to 0.
   - `left` is \(\max(0, -2 \times k)\).
   - `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, 2 \times k) + 1\).
   - `dp_prev` holds the original value of `dp_curr`.
   - `dp_curr` holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.

2. **Update Calculation:**
   - The new value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is calculated as `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`.
   - Since `i` is 0, `prefix_sum[i]` is 0 (as all elements in `prefix_sum` are initialized to 0).
   - Therefore, `prefix_sum[1]` is set to `(0 + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `dp_prev[0] % MOD`.

Given these points, the only change is to `prefix_sum[1]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with all elements set to 0 except `prefix_sum[1]` which is equal to `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `i` is 1, `left` is \(\max(0, -2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, 2 \times k) + 1\), `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.**
