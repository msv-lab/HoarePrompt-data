Output State: **i is 3, left is 0, right is 5, dp_curr is a list where the first element is ((prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD) and the second element is also ((prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD), and prefix_sum remains unchanged**

Explanation:
- The initial values are `i = 3`, `left = 0`, `right = 5`, `dp_curr` is a list where the first element is `(prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD` and the second element is also `(prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`, and `prefix_sum` remains unchanged.
- The first line updates `left` to `max(0, i - 2 * k)`. However, since the value of `k` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `left`. But given the initial state and without additional information about `k`, `left` remains `0`.
- The second line updates `right` to `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`. Again, since `k` and `max_diff` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `right`. But given the initial state and without additional information about `k` and `max_diff`, `right` remains `5`.
- The third line updates `dp_curr[i]` to `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`. Given that `right` is `5` and `left` is `0`, this simplifies to `(prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`. This is already the value stored in `dp_curr` at index `0`, so the value remains unchanged.

Since no new values for `i`, `left`, or `right` can be determined without further information, and the list `dp_curr` at index `i` is updated to the same value it already holds, the output state remains as described above.
