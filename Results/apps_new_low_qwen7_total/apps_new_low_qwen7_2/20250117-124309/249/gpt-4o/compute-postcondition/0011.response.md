Output State: **i is 1, left is 0, right is 5, dp_curr is a list where the first element is (prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD, and prefix_sum remains unchanged**

Explanation:
- The initial state has `i` set to 0.
- The first line calculates `left` as `max(0, i - 2 * k)`. Given `i` is 0, if `k` is a non-negative integer, `left` will be 0.
- The second line calculates `right` as `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`. Given `i` is 0, if `k` is a non-negative integer, `right` will be `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`.
- The third line updates `dp_curr[0]` to `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`. Given `left` is 0, this line updates `dp_curr[0]` to `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`.

Since the exact value of `k` and `max_diff` is not provided, we express the final state in terms of these variables, ensuring all impacted variables and their updated values are included. The other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
