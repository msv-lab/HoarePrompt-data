Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < 2 * max_diff + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is `(prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD`
   - `i` is `2 * max_diff + 2`
   - `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`
   - `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `2 * max_diff + 2`, the loop will not execute because `2 * max_diff + 2` is not less than `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed to `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `t`: No change needed since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `prefix_sum`: No change needed since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `dp_prev`: No change needed since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `dp_curr`: No change needed since it is not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `2 * max_diff + 1` (one less than its current value) for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is `(prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD`, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`**
