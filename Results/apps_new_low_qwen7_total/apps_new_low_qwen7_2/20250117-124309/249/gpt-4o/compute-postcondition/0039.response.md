Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head includes the variable `i`.
2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `range(2 * max_diff + 1)` iterations.
4. **Incrementing `i`**: Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i = 2`.

Now, let's update the states:

- **`t`**: The condition for `t` is that it must be greater than 0. This condition does not depend on the loop variable `i`, so it remains unchanged.
- **`prefix_sum`**: The list `prefix_sum` is already initialized with specific values, and these values do not change within the loop unless explicitly modified inside the loop body. Therefore, the state of `prefix_sum` remains unchanged.
- **`i`**: As calculated, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
- **`left` and `right`**: These are defined as follows:
  - `left = max(0, -2 * k)`
  - `right = min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`

Since the values of `k` and `max_diff` are not changed by the loop itself (assuming they are constants or unchanged from the previous iteration), `left` and `right` remain the same.

- **`dp_prev` and `dp_curr`**: These lists hold the updated values of the previous and current sums. They are reassigned inside the loop, but since the loop has not yet run, their values remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` is now 2.
- The conditions for `t` and the definitions of `left` and `right` remain unchanged.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with all elements set to 0 except `prefix_sum[1]` which is equal to `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `i` is 2, `left` is \(\max(0, -2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, 2 \times k) + 1\), `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.**
