Let's analyze the given loop and its effects step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 2 * max_diff`.
- During each iteration, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated as `prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **`t`**: Must be greater than 0 and remains unchanged unless modified outside the loop.
- **`prefix_sum`**: Initially all elements are 0. After the loop, the elements will be updated according to the loop's logic.
- **`i`**: Starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time the loop runs until it reaches `2 * max_diff + 1`.
- **`left` and `right`**: These remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`dp_prev` and `dp_curr`**: These are updated but their specific values depend on the previous state of `dp_prev` and the values of `prefix_sum`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` for each `i` from 0 to `2 * max_diff`.
- Each update is dependent on the previous element in `prefix_sum` and the corresponding element in `dp_prev`.
- The final state of `prefix_sum` will be such that each element `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` elements modulo `MOD`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- After `i` iterations, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` will be the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`.
- The loop will execute `2 * max_diff + 1` times if `t` remains greater than 0.

### Final Output State
After the loop has executed `2 * max_diff + 1` times, the final state of the variables will be:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum` will be a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) where each element `prefix_sum[i + 1]` for `i` from 0 to `2 * max_diff` will be the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`.
- `i` will be `2 * max_diff + 1`.
- `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` will hold their final updated values.

Output State: **`t` > 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) where each element `prefix_sum[i + 1]` for `i` from 0 to `2 * max_diff` is the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`, `i` = `2 * max_diff + 1`, `left` and `right` remain unchanged, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` hold their final updated values.**
