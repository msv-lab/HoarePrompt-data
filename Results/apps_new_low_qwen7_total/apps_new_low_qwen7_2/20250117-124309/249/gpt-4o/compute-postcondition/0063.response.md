Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t`. It initializes a dynamic programming table (`dp_prev`) and calculates a maximum difference (`max_diff`). The function then iterates over `t` times, updating a prefix sum array (`prefix_sum`) and a current DP table (`dp_curr`). During each iteration, it calculates the contribution of elements within a sliding window of size `2*k` around each index `i` to update `dp_curr`. After the loop, it computes the sum of specific elements in the `dp_prev` table, modulo `MOD`, and returns this result.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where `t` is less than 3. If `t < 3`, the loop would not execute, and the initial values of `dp_prev` might not be properly utilized, leading to incorrect results.
- The function assumes that `MOD` is defined and known. If `MOD` is not defined, the function will raise a NameError.
- The function does not check for potential overflow issues when performing arithmetic operations modulo `MOD`.

**Final State:**
- After the function concludes, the variable `result` contains the sum of certain elements in the `dp_prev` table, specifically from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`, modulo `MOD`. The other variables (`dp_prev`, `dp_curr`, and `prefix_sum`) are no longer referenced after the loop, and their contents are not returned or explicitly used in the final output.
