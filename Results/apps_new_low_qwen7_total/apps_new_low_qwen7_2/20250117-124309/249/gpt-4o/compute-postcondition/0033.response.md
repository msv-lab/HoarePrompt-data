Let's analyze the given Python loop step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `2 * max_diff + 1`. For each iteration, it updates `dp_curr[i]` based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.

- **Invariants**:
  - `t` remains greater than 1.
  - The only non-zero element in `prefix_sum` is `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`.
  - `i` starts at `2 * max_diff + 2` and decreases in each iteration.
  - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` hold their respective values as they are updated within the loop.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Variables Updated in Each Iteration**:
  - `dp_curr[i]` is updated based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.
- **Variables Remaining Constant**:
  - `t` > 1
  - `prefix_sum` initially has one non-zero element, and no other elements are modified by the loop.
  - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are updated within the loop but retain their original values outside the loop.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop updates `dp_curr` based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`. Since `i` starts at `2 * max_diff + 2` and decreases, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `0`.

- **Final Values**:
  - `t` remains greater than 1.
  - `prefix_sum` remains unchanged, with only `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` being non-zero.
  - `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.
  - `left` and `right` will be calculated based on the final value of `i`.
  - `dp_curr` will be updated for each `i` from `2 * max_diff + 1` down to `0`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
After the loop completes, `dp_curr` will have been updated for all indices from `0` to `2 * max_diff + 1`. The specific values will depend on the sums of `prefix_sum` between `left` and `right` for each `i`.

### Output State
Since the loop runs from `2 * max_diff + 2` down to `0`, and given that the only non-zero element in `prefix_sum` is `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`, the final state of the variables will be as follows:

- `t` > 1
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`, which is \((dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) \% \text{MOD}\).
- `i` is `0`.
- `dp_curr` is updated for all indices from `0` to `2 * max_diff + 1` based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.

Output State: **t must be greater than 1, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 where all elements are 0 except for prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2] which is (dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD, i is 0, left is max(0, i - 2 * k), right is min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr is updated for all indices from 0 to 2 * max_diff + 1 based on the sum of prefix_sum values between left and right, dp_prev now holds the original value of dp_curr, dp_curr now holds the original value of dp_prev**.
