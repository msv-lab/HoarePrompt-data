You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head is variable students, index and list student_list so these are the only ones that can control if the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1; `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.

### Analysis:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The initial state of `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
   - The loop runs from `i` in the range `0` to `2 * max_diff`, meaning it will execute exactly `2 * max_diff + 1` times.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated in each iteration as `prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`.
   - `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, so after `2 * max_diff + 1` iterations, `i` will be `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - Each iteration updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` based on the previous value `prefix_sum[i]` and the current value of `dp_prev[i]`.
   - After the loop completes, `prefix_sum[0]` and `prefix_sum[1]` will still be `0`, and the rest of the elements in `prefix_sum` will be the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from `prefix_sum[2]`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationship between `prefix_sum` and `dp_prev` is consistent with the given output states.
   - The loop always executes `2 * max_diff + 1` times, updating `prefix_sum` as described.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1; `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.
```
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.
