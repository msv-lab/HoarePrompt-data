The code swaps the values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`. Before the swap, `dp_prev` is updated to the final state of `dp_curr`. After the swap, `dp_prev` takes the value of `dp_curr` from before the swap, and `dp_curr` takes the value of `dp_prev` from before the swap.

Given the initial state where `dp_prev` is updated to the final state of `dp_curr`, the new state after the swap will be that `dp_prev` is now equal to the original value of `dp_curr`, and `dp_curr` is equal to the original value of `dp_prev`.

Output State: **`dp_prev` is the original value of `dp_curr`; `dp_curr` is the original value of `dp_prev`**
