The code initializes `prefix_sum` as a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3`, where all elements are set to 0. This means that `prefix_sum` is now a list of zeros with the specified length. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `dp_prev`, `dp_curr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`.**
