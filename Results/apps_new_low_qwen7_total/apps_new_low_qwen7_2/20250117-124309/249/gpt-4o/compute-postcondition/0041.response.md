Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Head**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1)`. This means the loop variable `i` ranges from 0 to `2 * max_diff`.

2. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i`.

3. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is now 3.

4. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be within the range of `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`. 

5. **Check the Range**: Since `i` is currently 3, and assuming `max_diff` is known and non-negative, the loop will execute again if `i < 2 * max_diff + 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `2 * max_diff + 1`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum[1]` remains `val` (which is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`).
- `prefix_sum[2]` remains 0.
- `prefix_sum[3]` is updated to `dp_prev[2] % MOD`.
- `i` must now be less than `2 * max_diff + 1`.
- `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain in their updated states.

Since the only variable that changes within the loop head is `i`, and it must be adjusted to ensure the loop continues, the new state is:

**State: `t` remains greater than 0, `prefix_sum[1]` remains `val` (which is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`), `prefix_sum[2]` remains 0, `prefix_sum[3]` is updated to `dp_prev[2] % MOD`, `i` is less than `2 * max_diff + 1`, `left` and `right` remain unchanged, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain in their updated states.**
