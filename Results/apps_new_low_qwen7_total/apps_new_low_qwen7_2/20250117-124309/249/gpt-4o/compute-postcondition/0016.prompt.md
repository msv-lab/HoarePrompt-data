Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1; `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.

### Analysis:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The initial state of `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
   - The loop runs from `i` in the range `0` to `2 * max_diff`, meaning it will execute exactly `2 * max_diff + 1` times.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated in each iteration as `prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`.
   - `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, so after `2 * max_diff + 1` iterations, `i` will be `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - Each iteration updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` based on the previous value `prefix_sum[i]` and the current value of `dp_prev[i]`.
   - After the loop completes, `prefix_sum[0]` and `prefix_sum[1]` will still be `0`, and the rest of the elements in `prefix_sum` will be the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from `prefix_sum[2]`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationship between `prefix_sum` and `dp_prev` is consistent with the given output states.
   - The loop always executes `2 * max_diff + 1` times, updating `prefix_sum` as described.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1; `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
    right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
    dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: i is 1, left is 0, right is 5, dp_curr is a list where the first element is (prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD, and prefix_sum remains unchanged
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: i is 2, left is 0, right is 5, dp_curr is a list where the first element is (prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD and the second element is also (prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD, and prefix_sum remains unchanged
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: i is 3, left is 0, right is 5, dp_curr is a list where the first element is ((prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD) and the second element is also ((prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD), and prefix_sum remains unchanged


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
