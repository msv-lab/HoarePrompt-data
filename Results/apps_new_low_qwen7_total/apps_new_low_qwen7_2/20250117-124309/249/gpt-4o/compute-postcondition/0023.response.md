The code snippet updates the `prefix_sum` list by adding the value of `dp_prev[i]` to `prefix_sum[i]` and taking the modulo `MOD`. This happens within the loop when `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0
- `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`
- `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`
- `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`

After the current iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `2 * max_diff + 2`. The `prefix_sum` list is updated as follows:
- `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`
- Since `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`
- `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` is set to `(prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD`

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is `(prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD`
- `i` is now `2 * max_diff + 2`
- `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`
- `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is `(prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD`, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 2`, `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`**.
