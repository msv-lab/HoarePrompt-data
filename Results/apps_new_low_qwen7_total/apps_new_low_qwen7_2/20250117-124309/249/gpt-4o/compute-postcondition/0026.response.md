Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is `(dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD` (since it gets updated twice), `i` is `2 * max_diff + 2`, `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`**.

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are initially 0.
   - `i` starts as `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`.
   - `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`.

2. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
   - `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated in each iteration.
   - `i` increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `dp_prev` remains unchanged and holds the original value of `dp_curr`.
   - `dp_curr` remains unchanged and holds the original value of `dp_prev`.

3. **Loop Behavior Summary**:
   - The loop runs until `i` reaches `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - In each iteration, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated as `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`.
   - Since `i` starts at `2 * max_diff + 1`, the first update happens at `i + 1 = 2 * max_diff + 2`.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `2 * max_diff + 2` since it increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The only non-zero element in `prefix_sum` will be `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`, which will be updated based on the original values of `dp_prev`.
   - Specifically, if the loop runs exactly 2 times, `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` will be `dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] % MOD`.
   - If the loop runs exactly 3 times, `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` will be `(dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD`.

In conclusion, after the loop has executed its full cycle:
- `t` remains greater than 1.
- `prefix_sum` remains a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is updated according to the loop's behavior.
- `i` is `2 * max_diff + 2`.
- `dp_prev` holds the original value of `dp_curr`.
- `dp_curr` holds the original value of `dp_prev`.

This ensures the final state is consistent with the loop's execution and the provided initial conditions.
