Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1)`.
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter.
   - `2 * max_diff + 1` determines the upper limit of the loop.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `left` is 0.
   - `right` is 5.
   - `dp_curr` is a list where the first element is `(prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD` and the second element is also `(prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`.
   - `prefix_sum` remains unchanged.

3. **Calculate the new value of `i`:**
   Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue:**
   The loop continues as long as `i < 2 * max_diff + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `left`, `right`, `dp_curr`, and `prefix_sum` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `left` is 0, `right` is 5, `dp_curr` is a list where the first element is `(prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD` and the second element is also `(prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`, and `prefix_sum` remains unchanged**.
