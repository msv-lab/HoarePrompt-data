The code initializes `prefix_sum` to a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with all elements set to 0. This means that the values of `t`, `i`, `left`, `right`, `dp_prev`, and `dp_curr` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `prefix_sum` list itself.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with all elements set to 0, `i` is 0, `left` is \(\max(0, -2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, 2 \times k) + 1\), `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`**
