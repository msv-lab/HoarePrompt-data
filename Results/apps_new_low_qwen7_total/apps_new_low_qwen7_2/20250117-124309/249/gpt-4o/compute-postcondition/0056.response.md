Let's go through the process step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is greater than or equal to 3
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with the first two elements as 0 and the rest being cumulative sums of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1
   - `i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 1\)
   - `left` is \(\max(0, (\text{max_diff} + 1) - 2 \times k)\)
   - `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, (\text{max_diff} + 1) + 2 \times k) + 1\)
   - `dp_prev` holds the value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration
   - `result` is \((result + dp_prev[i-1]) \% MOD\)

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from \(\text{max_diff} + 1\) to \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\).

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The variable `i` starts at \(\text{max_diff} + 1\) and increases by 1 each iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it \(\text{max_diff} + 2\).
   - All other variables are not modified within the loop and remain the same.

### Updated States:

- `t` remains unchanged (still greater than or equal to 3)
- `prefix_sum` remains unchanged (it's a list that doesn't change during the loop execution)
- `i` changes to \(\text{max_diff} + 2\)
- `left` remains unchanged (since it depends on \(\text{max_diff}\) and \(k\), which don't change in this context)
- `right` remains unchanged (same reasoning as above)
- `dp_prev` remains unchanged (it holds the value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration, and no changes are made within the loop)
- `result` is updated to include the new value of `dp_prev[i-1]` (which is `dp_prev[\text{max_diff} + 1]`).

### Final State:

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 3, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1, `i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 2\), `left` is \(\max(0, (\text{max_diff} + 1) - 2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, (\text{max_diff} + 1) + 2 \times k) + 1\), `dp_prev` holds the value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration, `result` is \((result + dp_prev[\text{max_diff} + 1]) \% MOD\)**
