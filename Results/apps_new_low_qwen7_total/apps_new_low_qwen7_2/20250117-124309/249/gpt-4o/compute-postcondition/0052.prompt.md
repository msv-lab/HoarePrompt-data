Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, max_diff is 2 * k * t, dp_prev is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0 except for the element at index max_diff + (a - b) which is 1, dp_curr is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (2 * max_diff + 3)
    for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
    for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
        left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
        right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
        dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
    dp_prev, dp_curr = dp_curr, dp_prev


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `t` must be greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1; `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`; `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`; `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The code swaps the values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`. Initially, `dp_curr` holds the updated values based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`, and `dp_prev` holds the original value of `dp_curr`.

After executing the line `dp_prev, dp_curr = dp_curr, dp_prev`:

- The value of `dp_prev` is now the same as the original value of `dp_curr`.
- The value of `dp_curr` is now the updated value, which is the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` must be greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length 2 * `max_diff` + 3 where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is (`dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]`) % `MOD`, `i` is 0, `left` is `max(0, i - 2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`**.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `dp_prev` is the original value of `dp_curr`; `dp_curr` is the original value of `dp_prev`


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
