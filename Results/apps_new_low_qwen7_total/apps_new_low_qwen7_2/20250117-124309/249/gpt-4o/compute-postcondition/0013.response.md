Initial State: `i` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 5, `dp_curr` is a list where the first element is `(prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`, and `prefix_sum` remains unchanged

Code Snippet:
```
left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
```

Let's break down the code and calculate the final values step by step:

1. **Assign `left`**:
   - The value of `i` is 2.
   - The expression for `left` is `max(0, i - 2 * k)`.
   - We need the value of `k` to proceed. However, `k` is not defined in the initial state or the given code. Let's assume `k` is a positive integer such that `i - 2 * k` does not become negative. For simplicity, let's assume `k` is 1 (a common assumption when `k` is not specified). So, `i - 2 * k = 2 - 2 * 1 = 0`.
   - Therefore, `left = max(0, 0) = 0`.

2. **Assign `right`**:
   - The value of `i` is 2.
   - We need the value of `max_diff` to proceed. However, `max_diff` is not defined in the initial state or the given code. Let's assume `max_diff` is a positive integer such that `2 * max_diff` is greater than or equal to `i + 2 * k`. For simplicity, let's assume `max_diff` is 2 (a common assumption when `max_diff` is not specified). So, `i + 2 * k = 2 + 2 * 1 = 4` and `2 * max_diff = 4`.
   - Therefore, `right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1 = min(4, 4) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`.

3. **Update `dp_curr[i]`**:
   - The expression for `dp_curr[i]` is `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.
   - We already calculated `left = 0` and `right = 5`.
   - Therefore, `dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`.

From the initial state, we know that the first element of `dp_curr` is `(prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`. After running the code, this value remains the same because we are just reassigning it to `dp_curr[2]`.

Final Output State: **i is 2, left is 0, right is 5, dp_curr is a list where the first element is (prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD and the second element is also (prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD, and prefix_sum remains unchanged**
