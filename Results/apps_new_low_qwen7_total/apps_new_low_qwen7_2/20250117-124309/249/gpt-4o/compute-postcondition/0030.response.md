Let's analyze the provided code snippet step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 3\) where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 2]` which is \((\text{dp\_prev}[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1] + \text{dp\_prev}[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1]) \% \text{MOD}\)
- `i` is 1
- `left` is \(\max(0, 1 - 2 \times k)\)
- `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, 1 + 2 \times k) + 1\)
- \(\text{dp\_curr}[1]\) is \((\text{prefix\_sum}[right] - \text{prefix\_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\)
- \(\text{dp\_prev}\) holds the original value of \(\text{dp\_curr}[0]\)
- \(\text{dp\_curr}\) holds the original value of \(\text{dp\_prev}\)

### Code Snippet:
```python
left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Update `left`:**
   - `left` is updated to \(\max(0, i - 2 \times k)\).
   - Given `i` is 1, we need the value of `k` to compute this. Let's assume `k` is known or can be inferred. For now, let's leave it as \(1 - 2 \times k\).

2. **Update `right`:**
   - `right` is updated to \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, i + 2 \times k) + 1\).
   - Again, we need the value of `k` to compute this. Let's assume `k` is known or can be inferred. For now, let's leave it as \(1 + 2 \times k\).

3. **Update `dp_curr[i]`:**
   - `dp_curr[i]` is set to \((\text{prefix\_sum}[right] - \text{prefix\_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\).
   - We know that initially, `prefix_sum` is mostly 0, with one non-zero element at `prefix_sum[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 2]`.

Given these updates:
- `left` and `right` depend on `k`, which isn't specified. However, they should still be within bounds if `k` is chosen appropriately.
- The value of `dp_curr[1]` will be \((\text{prefix\_sum}[right] - \text{prefix\_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\).

### Final State:
Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot compute exact numerical values for `left` and `right`. However, we can describe the final state in terms of the variables and their relationships:

- `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 1.
- `prefix_sum` remains mostly 0, with one non-zero element at `prefix_sum[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 2]`.
- `i` is updated to `1`.
- `left` and `right` are updated based on `i` and `k`.
- `dp_curr[1]` is updated to \((\text{prefix\_sum}[right] - \text{prefix\_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\).

Thus, the final state is:

Output State: **t is greater than 1, prefix_sum is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 3\) where all elements are 0 except for prefix_sum[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 2] which is \((\text{dp\_prev}[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1] + \text{dp\_prev}[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1]) \% \text{MOD}\), i is 1, left is \(\max(0, 1 - 2 \times k)\), right is \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, 1 + 2 \times k) + 1\), dp_curr[1] is \((\text{prefix\_sum}[right] - \text{prefix\_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\)**
