The code updates the `result` by adding the value of `dp_prev[i]` and taking modulo `MOD`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is greater than or equal to 3
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with the first two elements being 0 and the rest being the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1
- `i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 2\)
- `left` is \(\max(0, (\text{max_diff} + 1) - 2 \times k)\)
- `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, (\text{max_diff} + 1) + 2 \times k) + 1\)
- `dp_prev` holds the value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration
- `result` is \((result + dp_prev[\text{max_diff} + 1]) \% MOD\)

After executing the line `result = (result + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`, the value of `result` is updated. Since `i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 2\), the new value of `result` is \((result + dp_prev[\text{max_diff} + 2]) \% MOD\).

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 3, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with the first two elements being 0 and the rest being the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1, `i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 2\), `left` is \(\max(0, (\text{max_diff} + 1) - 2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, (\text{max_diff} + 1) + 2 \times k) + 1\), `dp_prev` holds the value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration, `result` is \((result + dp_prev[\text{max_diff} + 2]) \% MOD\)**
