Output State: `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 3\) with the first two elements being 0 and the rest being the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1, `i` is \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1\), `left` is \(\max(0, (2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1) - 2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, (2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1) + 2 \times k) + 1\), `dp_prev` holds the value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration, `result` is the sum of all `dp_prev` values from index \(\max(0, \text{max\_diff} + 1 - 2k)\) to \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1\) modulo `MOD`.

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = max_diff + 1` to `i = 2 * max_diff`.
   - Inside the loop, it updates the `result` by adding the value of `dp_prev[i]` to `result` and taking the modulo `MOD`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` starts at `max_diff + 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `2 * max_diff`.
   - `result` is updated in each iteration by adding the value of `dp_prev[i]` and taking the modulo `MOD`.
   - `left` and `right` are calculated based on `i` and `k`, but their values do not affect the final `result` as the loop directly accesses `dp_prev[i]`.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are updated based on the prefix sum but remain invariant in terms of the loopâ€™s effect on `result`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1\).
   - The `result` will be the sum of `dp_prev` values from `max(0, max_diff + 1 - 2k)` to \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1\) modulo `MOD`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The final `result` is consistent with the cumulative addition of `dp_prev` values within the specified range.
   - The `prefix_sum` remains unchanged and continues to hold the cumulative sums of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD`.

Thus, the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations is as described above.
