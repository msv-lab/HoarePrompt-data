Output State: **`t` remains greater than 0, `prefix_sum[1]` remains `val` (which is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`), `prefix_sum[2]` remains 0, `prefix_sum[3]` is updated to `(prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD`, `i` is less than `2 * max_diff + 1`, `left` and `right` remain unchanged, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain in their updated states.**
