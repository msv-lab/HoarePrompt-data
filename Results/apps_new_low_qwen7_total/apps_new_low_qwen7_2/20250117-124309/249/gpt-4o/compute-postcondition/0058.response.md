Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`.
   
2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop runs from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`. The condition for the next iteration is that `i` should be within this range.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with specific initial values.
   - `i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 2\).
   - `left` is \(\max(0, (\text{max_diff} + 1) - 2 \times k)\).
   - `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, (\text{max_diff} + 1) + 2 \times k) + 1\).
   - `dp_prev` holds the value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration.
   - `result` is \((result + dp_prev[\text{max_diff} + 2]) \% MOD\).

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be \(\text{max_diff} + 3\).
   - All other variables remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **State After Adjusting for the Next Iteration**:
   - `t` remains greater than or equal to 3.
   - `prefix_sum` remains as it was.
   - `i` becomes \(\text{max_diff} + 3\).
   - `left` remains \(\max(0, (\text{max_diff} + 1) - 2 \times k)\).
   - `right` remains \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, (\text{max_diff} + 1) + 2 \times k) + 1\).
   - `dp_prev` remains the same as it was.
   - `result` remains \((result + dp_prev[\text{max_diff} + 2]) \% MOD\).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 3, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with the first two elements being 0 and the rest being the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1, `i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 3\), `left` is \(\max(0, (\text{max_diff} + 1) - 2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, (\text{max_diff} + 1) + 2 \times k) + 1\), `dp_prev` holds the value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration, `result` is \((result + dp_prev[\text{max_diff} + 2]) \% MOD\)**
