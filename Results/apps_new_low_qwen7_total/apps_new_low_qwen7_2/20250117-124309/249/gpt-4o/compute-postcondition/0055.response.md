`result` is updated by adding `dp_prev[i]` to it and then taking modulo `MOD`. Given that `i` is `\text{max\_diff} + 1`, the value of `dp_prev[i]` is taken from the previous iteration's `dp_prev`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 3, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 3\) where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1, `i` is \(\text{max\_diff} + 1\), `left` is \(\max(0, (\text{max\_diff} + 1) - 2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, (\text{max\_diff} + 1) + 2 \times k) + 1\), `dp_prev` holds the value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration, `result` is `(result + dp_prev[i-1]) % MOD`**.
