Output State: **t must be greater than 1, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 where all elements are 0 except for prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2] which is (dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD, i is 0, left is max(0, i - 2 * k), right is min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr[i] is (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD, dp_prev now holds the original value of dp_curr, dp_curr now holds the original value of dp_prev**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `t > 1`, `prefix_sum` being a list of zeros except for the last element which is `(dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD`, `i` is 0, `dp_prev` holds the original value of `dp_curr`, and `dp_curr` holds the original value of `dp_prev`.
- The code defines `left` and `right` based on the current value of `i` (which is 0) and `k` (not provided, assumed to be a defined variable).
  - `left = max(0, i - 2 * k) = max(0, 0 - 2 * k) = max(0, -2 * k)` which is `0` since `t > 1` implies `k >= 1`, so `-2 * k` is always negative or zero.
  - `right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1 = min(2 * max_diff, 0 + 2 * k) + 1 = min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`. Given `i = 0`, this simplifies to `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`.
- The line `dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD` calculates `dp_curr[0]` using the range `[left, right)`.
  - Since `left` is `0`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`.
  - Therefore, `dp_curr[0] = (prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`.

Given the initial conditions, the only modification is to `dp_curr[0]`, which is set to the value derived from the specified range in `prefix_sum`. The rest of the state remains unchanged due to the lack of further modifications to other variables.
