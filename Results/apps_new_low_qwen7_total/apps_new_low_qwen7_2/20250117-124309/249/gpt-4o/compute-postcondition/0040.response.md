Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with all elements set to 0 except `prefix_sum[1]` which is equal to `dp_prev[0] % MOD`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `left` is \(\max(0, -2 \times k)\).
   - `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, 2 \times k) + 1\).
   - `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`.
   - `dp_curr` now holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
   ```

3. **Impact of the Code:**
   - `i` is 2, so `prefix_sum[i + 1]` refers to `prefix_sum[3]`.
   - `prefix_sum[3]` is being assigned the value `(prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD`.

4. **Updating the Values:**
   - Since `prefix_sum[1]` was the only element initially set to a non-zero value (`dp_prev[0] % MOD`), let's denote this value as `val`.
   - We know `prefix_sum[2]` is initially 0 because the list starts with all zeros.
   - So, `prefix_sum[3]` becomes `(0 + dp_prev[2]) % MOD = dp_prev[2] % MOD`.

5. **Final Output State:**
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `prefix_sum[1]` remains `val` (which is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`).
   - `prefix_sum[2]` remains 0.
   - `prefix_sum[3]` is updated to `dp_prev[2] % MOD`.
   - `i` is now 3 (though the problem doesn't ask to explicitly state this change).
   - `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain in their updated states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `prefix_sum[2]` is 0, `prefix_sum[3]` is `dp_prev[2] % MOD`; `i` is 3; `left` is \(\max(0, -2 \times k)\); `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, 2 \times k) + 1\); `dp_prev` holds the original value of `dp_curr`; `dp_curr` holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.**
