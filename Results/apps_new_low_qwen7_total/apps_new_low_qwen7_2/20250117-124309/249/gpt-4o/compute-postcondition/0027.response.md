Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables**: The loop head involves variables `i` and `max_diff`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `2 * max_diff + 1`. Therefore, the loop will execute the first time when `i` is `0`.

3. **Current state of variables**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is `(dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD`.
   - `i` is currently `2 * max_diff + 2`.
   - `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`.
   - `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`.

4. **Required state for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the range specified by the loop condition. Specifically, `i` should be `0`.
   - Since `i` is currently `2 * max_diff + 2`, we need to adjust it to `0`.

5. **Other variables' states remain unchanged as they are not directly controlled by the loop condition**.

Therefore, the required state for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is `(dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD`, `i` must be 0, `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`**.
