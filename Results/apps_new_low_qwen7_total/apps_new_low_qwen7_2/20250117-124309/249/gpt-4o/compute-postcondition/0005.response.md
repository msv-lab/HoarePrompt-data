Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves `i` and the condition `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and the condition related to `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros
   - `i` is 1
   - `prefix_sum[2]` is `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to `2`.
   - The condition for the loop is `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`, so `i` must be less than `2 * max_diff + 1` for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. The other variables (`t`, `prefix_sum`, and `max_diff`) remain unchanged because they are not directly involved in the loop head conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros; `i` is 2; `prefix_sum[2]` is `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`**
