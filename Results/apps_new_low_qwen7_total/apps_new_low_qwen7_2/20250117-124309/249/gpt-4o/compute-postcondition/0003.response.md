Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.

2. **Understand the For Loop:**
   - The for loop iterates over `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`, meaning the loop variable `i` will take values from `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`.
   - At the start of the loop, `i` should be `0` because the loop will increment `i` during each iteration.

4. **Verify the State Before the First Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and the loop will increment `i` during each iteration, the initial value of `i` must be `0`.
   - `max_diff` is a constant, so its value does not change, but we need to ensure that `i` is set to `0` before the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the state before the first iteration of the loop must satisfy:
- `i` must be `0`.
- `t` must still be greater than `0`.
- `prefix_sum` remains a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.

Therefore, the required state before the first execution of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros, `i` is 0**
