Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` must be greater than 1
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0
   - `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`
   - `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`
   - `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 2 * max_diff`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but it updates `prefix_sum` and other variables based on the current value of `i`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - We are currently at the start of the loop iteration where `i = 2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < 2 * max_diff + 1`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i`.
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `2 * max_diff + 2`.

5. **Updated State**:
   - The state of `prefix_sum`, `dp_prev`, and `dp_curr` does not change within the loop head; these are modified inside the loop body.
   - Therefore, we only need to update the state of `i`.

**Output State**:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (unchanged)
- `prefix_sum` remains a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is `dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] % MOD` (unchanged)
- `i` is now `2 * max_diff + 2`
- `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr` (unchanged)
- `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev` (unchanged)

So, the final state is:
**`t` must be greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is `dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] % MOD`, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 2`, `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`**.
