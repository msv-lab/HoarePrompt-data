Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2]` which is \((\text{dp_prev}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] + \text{dp_prev}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1]) \% \text{MOD}\).
- `i` is 0.
- `left` is \(\max(0, i - 2 \times k)\).
- `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, i + 2 \times k) + 1\).
- `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`.
- `dp_curr` now holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.

### For Loop Statement
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `_` is just a placeholder, and it doesn't affect the state directly.
- The key variables in the loop head that can be adjusted are `t`, `i`, `left`, `right`, `dp_prev`, and `dp_curr`.

### Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration
1. **`t`**: Since the loop is controlled by `t`, and we need to check if `t` is greater than 1, after the first iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1. So, `t` must be greater than 0.
2. **`i`**: The problem does not specify how `i` changes, but generally, in such problems, `i` might be incremented or modified within the loop body. Without specific details, let's assume it remains 0 for simplicity (if no changes are mentioned).
3. **`left`**: Since `i` remains 0, `left` remains \(\max(0, 0 - 2 \times k)\) which simplifies to \(\max(0, -2 \times k)\). This value depends on `k` and will remain unchanged if no modification is specified.
4. **`right`**: Similarly, `right` remains \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, 0 + 2 \times k) + 1\) which simplifies to \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, 2 \times k) + 1\). This value depends on `k` and will remain unchanged if no modification is specified.
5. **`dp_prev`**: After the swap, `dp_prev` holds the original value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration.
6. **`dp_curr`**: After the swap, `dp_curr` holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.

### Final State for the Next Iteration
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2]` which is \((\text{dp_prev}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] + \text{dp_prev}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1]) \% \text{MOD}\), `i` is 0, `left` is \(\max(0, -2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, 2 \times k) + 1\), `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`**.
