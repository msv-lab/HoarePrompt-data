Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 3, `prefix_sum` is a list of length 2 * `max_diff` + 3 where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1, `i` is 0, `left` is `max(0, i - 2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_prev` now holds the value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration, `dp_curr` now holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right` for the current iteration**.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates `t` times, updating the `dp_curr` list based on the cumulative sums in `prefix_sum`.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
   - `t` is the number of iterations.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are cumulative sums of `dp_prev` values.
   - `i` ranges from 0 to `2 * max_diff + 1` but only the first iteration sets `i` to 1 and updates `prefix_sum`.
   - `left` and `right` are used to define the range of indices for updating `dp_curr`.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` swap values each iteration.
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: 
   - Each iteration updates `dp_curr` using the cumulative sums in `prefix_sum` and then swaps `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`.
   - After `t` iterations, `dp_prev` will hold the original value of `dp_curr` from the last iteration, and `dp_curr` will hold the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values.
4. **Verify Relationships**: 
   - The cumulative sums in `prefix_sum` ensure that `dp_curr` correctly reflects the updated values.
   - The conditions under which the loop executes are that `t` must be a positive integer.

After executing the loop `t` times, the final states are as described above.
