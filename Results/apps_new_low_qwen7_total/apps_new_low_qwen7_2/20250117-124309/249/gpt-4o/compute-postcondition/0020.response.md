Let's break down the conditions needed for the loop to execute the first time:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 2 * max_diff + 1` as given.
   - The loop condition is `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`, which means `i` will start from `2 * max_diff + 1` and go up to `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the range specified by the loop, which is from `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

2. **Variable `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`:**
   - It is mentioned that `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, and `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`.
   - This implies that `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` should be initialized or set to their original values before the loop starts.

Given the above points, let's determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time:

- The variable `i` must be exactly `2 * max_diff + 1` for the loop to start its first iteration.
- The variables `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` should be set to their original values, meaning they should retain the values they had before the loop started.

Thus, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`**.

Note that the condition `t must be greater than 1` is already satisfied and does not change within the loop. The other variables must meet the specific conditions mentioned.
