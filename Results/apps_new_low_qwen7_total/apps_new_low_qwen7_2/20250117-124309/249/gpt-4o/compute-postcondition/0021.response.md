The code updates the `prefix_sum` list at index `i + 1` with the value `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`. Here, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, so `i + 1` is `2 * max_diff + 2`. Since all elements in `prefix_sum` are initially set to 0, `prefix_sum[i]` is 0. Also, `dp_prev` is the original value of `dp_curr`, so `dp_prev[i]` is the value of `dp_curr` at index `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0
- `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`
- `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`
- `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`

The updated state will be:
- `prefix_sum[i + 1]` (which is `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`) is set to `(0 + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] % MOD` because `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1]` is 0.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` must be greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is `dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] % MOD`, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`**.
