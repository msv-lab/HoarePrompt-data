Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1; `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`; `left` and `right` are calculated within each iteration but do not affect the final state of `prefix_sum` or `i`.

### Analysis:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The initial state of `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
   - The loop runs from `i` in the range `0` to `2 * max_diff`, meaning it will execute exactly `2 * max_diff + 1` times.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated in each iteration as `prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`.
   - `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, so after `2 * max_diff + 1` iterations, `i` will be `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.
   - `left` and `right` are calculated within the loop but do not affect the final state of `prefix_sum` or `i`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - Each iteration updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` based on the previous value `prefix_sum[i]` and the current value of `dp_prev[i]`.
   - After the loop completes, `prefix_sum[0]` and `prefix_sum[1]` will still be `0`, and the rest of the elements in `prefix_sum` will be the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from `prefix_sum[2]`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationship between `prefix_sum` and `dp_prev` is consistent with the given output states.
   - The loop always executes `2 * max_diff + 1` times, updating `prefix_sum` as described.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1; `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.**
