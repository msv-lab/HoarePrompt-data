Let's analyze the given Python loop step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `2 * max_diff + 1`. For each iteration, it updates `dp_curr[i]` based on the values in `prefix_sum`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariants**: The initial state of `t`, `prefix_sum`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **Variables Updated**: `dp_prev` is updated to become `dp_curr` at the end of the loop, but since we only need the final state after all iterations, we focus on `dp_curr`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop updates `dp_curr[i]` using the formula:
  \[
  \text{dp\_curr}[i] = (\text{prefix\_sum}[\text{right}] - \text{prefix\_sum}[\text{left}]) \% \text{MOD}
  \]
  where:
  \[
  \text{left} = \max(0, i - 2 * k)
  \]
  \[
  \text{right} = \min(2 * \text{max\_diff}, i + 2 * k) + 1
  \]

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- Each iteration of the loop updates `dp_curr` based on the values in `prefix_sum`.
- Since `prefix_sum` is defined as the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`, the loop effectively uses this cumulative sum to update `dp_curr`.

### Final Output State Calculation
Since the loop runs from `0` to `2 * max_diff + 1`, it will update every index in `dp_curr` exactly once. Therefore, after the loop completes, `dp_curr` will be fully updated based on the values in `prefix_sum`.

Given the initial conditions and the loop's behavior, the final state of the loop can be summarized as follows:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum` remains as initially provided.
- `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
- `dp_prev` is updated to the final state of `dp_curr`.

Output State: **dp_prev is updated to the final state of dp_curr, all other variables remain as initially provided.**
