Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1)`. The variables in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < 2 * max_diff + 1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: We need to check if `i` is still within the range `[0, 2 * max_diff]`. Given that `i` is now 2, it is still within the range, so the loop will continue.

6. **Adjust the other variables**: The other variables such as `t`, `prefix_sum`, `left`, `right`, and `dp_curr[1]` remain unchanged for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2]` which is \((\text{dp_prev}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] + \text{dp_prev}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1]) \% \text{MOD}\), `i` is 2, `left` is \(\max(0, 1 - 2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, 1 + 2 \times k) + 1\), `dp_curr[1]` is \((\text{prefix_sum}[right] - \text{prefix_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\)**
