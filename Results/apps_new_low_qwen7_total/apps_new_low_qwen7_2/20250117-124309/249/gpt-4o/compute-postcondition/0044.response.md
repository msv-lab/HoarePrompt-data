Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step to determine what must hold true for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Program State:
- `t > 0`: This indicates some condition involving `t`, but it's not directly relevant to the loop's execution.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\), and each element `prefix_sum[i + 1]` (for `i` from 0 to `2 * max_diff`) is the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`.
- `i = 2 * max_diff + 1`: The loop index `i` is set to this specific value.
- `left` and `right` remain unchanged: These variables are not directly involved in the loop's condition.
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` hold their final updated values: These are also not directly involved in the loop's condition.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `2 * max_diff + 0`, i.e., it will iterate from 0 to `2 * max_diff` inclusive.
- The loop condition is based on the range `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`, which means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `2 * max_diff + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Condition of `i`:**
   - The problem statement mentions that `i = 2 * max_diff + 1`. However, this initial value of `i` is outside the range `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`, because the range starts from 0 and goes up to `2 * max_diff`.
   
2. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < 2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - Since `i` is initially set to `2 * max_diff + 1`, the loop condition `i < 2 * max_diff + 1` will evaluate to `False` on the first iteration.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the range `0` to `2 * max_diff` inclusive. Therefore, we need to adjust the initial value of `i` to be `0` instead of `2 * max_diff + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t > 0`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\), `i` must be 0, `left` and `right` remain unchanged, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` hold their final updated values.**
