Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial State Before the Loop
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 3\) where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `left` is \(\max(0, i - 2 \times k)\).
- `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, i + 2 \times k) + 1\).
- `dp_prev` now holds the value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration.
- `dp_curr` now holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right` for the current iteration.
- `result` is 0.

### For Loop Statement
```
for i in range(max_diff + 1, 2 * max_diff + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis for First Execution
To determine the state required for the loop to execute the first time, we need to evaluate the condition `i in range(max_diff + 1, 2 * max_diff + 1)`.

1. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - Initially, `i` is set to 0.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will start executing when `i` transitions to the first value in the range \( \text{max\_diff} + 1 \).

3. **Transition from Initial State to Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to enter its first iteration, `i` must change from 0 to \(\text{max\_diff} + 1\).

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The value of `i` is the only variable in the loop that determines whether the loop will start. Therefore, the other variables (`prefix_sum`, `left`, `right`, `dp_prev`, `dp_curr`, `result`, and `t`) do not need to change for the loop to execute the first time.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute the first time, the value of `i` must transition from 0 to \(\text{max\_diff} + 1\).

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 3, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 3\) where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1, `i` is \(\text{max\_diff} + 1\), `left` is \(\max(0, (\text{max\_diff} + 1) - 2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, (\text{max\_diff} + 1) + 2 \times k) + 1\), `dp_prev` holds the value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration, `dp_curr` holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right` for the current iteration, `result` is 0.**
