To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions and variables involved:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0`.
   - The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `2 * max_diff + 1`.

2. **List `prefix_sum`:**
   - It is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements set to 0.
   - This list does not change within the loop body, but its length and initial values are important.

3. **Variables `left` and `right`:**
   - `left` is initialized as `max(0, -2 * k)`.
   - `right` is initialized as `\min(2 * \text{max_diff}, 2 * k) + 1`.
   - These variables define the range of indices in `prefix_sum` that are relevant for the current iteration of the loop.

4. **Variables `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`:**
   - `dp_prev` holds the original value of `dp_curr` from the previous iteration.
   - `dp_curr` holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.

Given the initialization and the range of `i`, we need to ensure that the loop can proceed correctly for the first iteration. Specifically, we need to check the condition `i < 2 * max_diff + 1`.

Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * max_diff + 1`, the loop can execute the first time if and only if `i` is within this range.

Therefore, the only thing that needs to be explicitly checked is that `i` is 0, which is already given in the initial state.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) with all elements set to 0, `i` is 0, `left` is \(\max(0, -2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, 2 \times k) + 1\), `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`**

In summary, the state at the start of the loop must remain consistent with the initial conditions provided, and the only new requirement is that `i` must be 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
