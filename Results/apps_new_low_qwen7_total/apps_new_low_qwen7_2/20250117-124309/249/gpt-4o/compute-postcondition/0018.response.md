Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. This means the loop variable is an underscore `_` and the loop runs `t` times.

2. **Determine the relevant states**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` for the loop to execute one more time.

3. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1.
   - `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`.
   - `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 because the loop runs `t` times.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Given that `t` must be greater than 0 initially and needs to be decremented by 1 for the loop to continue, the new state will be that `t` must be greater than 0 and decremented by 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`.**
