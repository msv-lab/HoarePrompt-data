Output State: **i is 0, left is max(0, 0 - 2 * k), right is min(2 * max_diff, 0 + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr[0] is (prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 0 + 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[max(0, 0 - 2 * k)]) % MOD, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3, t > 0, left and right remain unchanged, dp_prev and dp_curr hold their final updated values**

Explanation:
- The first line updates `left` to be the maximum of 0 and `i - 2 * k`. Since `i` is 0, `left` becomes `max(0, 0 - 2 * k)`.
- The second line updates `right` to be the minimum of `2 * max_diff` and `i + 2 * k` plus 1. Since `i` is 0, `right` becomes `min(2 * max_diff, 0 + 2 * k) + 1`.
- The third line calculates `dp_curr[i]` as the difference between `prefix_sum[right]` and `prefix_sum[left]`, modulo `MOD`. This updates the value of `dp_curr[0]` based on the elements of the `prefix_sum` list within the range `[left, right)`.

Note: The values of `t`, `prefix_sum`, `left`, `right`, `dp_prev`, and `dp_curr` remain unchanged except for the specific calculation done on `dp_curr[0]`.
