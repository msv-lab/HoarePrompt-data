The code swaps the values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`. According to the initial state:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1.
- `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.

After executing the line `dp_prev, dp_curr = dp_curr, dp_prev`, the values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are swapped, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`.
- `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` where the first two elements are 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD` starting from index 1; `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`; `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`; `dp_curr` now holds the original value of `dp_prev`.**
