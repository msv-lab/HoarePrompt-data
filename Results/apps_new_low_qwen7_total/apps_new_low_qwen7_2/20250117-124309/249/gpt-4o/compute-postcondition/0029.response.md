Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 3\) where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 2]` which is \((\text{dp\_prev}[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1] + \text{dp\_prev}[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1]) \% \text{MOD}\)
- `i` is 0
- `left` is \(\max(0, i - 2 \times k)\)
- `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, i + 2 \times k) + 1\)
- \(\text{dp\_curr}[i]\) is \((\text{prefix\_sum}[right] - \text{prefix\_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\)
- \(\text{dp\_prev}\) now holds the original value of \(\text{dp\_curr}\)
- \(\text{dp\_curr}\) now holds the original value of \(\text{dp\_prev}\)

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to \(2 \times \text{max\_diff}\).

### Current Iteration:
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. The loop condition for the next iteration will be \(i < 2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1\).

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 1.

- `left` will be \(\max(0, 1 - 2 \times k)\)
- `right` will be \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, 1 + 2 \times k) + 1\)
- \(\text{dp\_curr}[1]\) will be \((\text{prefix\_sum}[right] - \text{prefix\_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\)
- \(\text{dp\_prev}\) will hold the original value of \(\text{dp\_curr}\) from the previous iteration (which is \(\text{dp\_curr}[0]\))
- \(\text{dp\_curr}\) will hold the original value of \(\text{dp\_prev}\) from the previous iteration (which is \(\text{dp\_prev}\))

### Updated States:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (unchanged)
- `prefix_sum` remains unchanged
- `i` is now 1
- `left` is \(\max(0, 1 - 2 \times k)\)
- `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, 1 + 2 \times k) + 1\)
- \(\text{dp\_curr}[1]\) is \((\text{prefix\_sum}[right] - \text{prefix\_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\)
- \(\text{dp\_prev}\) holds the original value of \(\text{dp\_curr}[0]\)
- \(\text{dp\_curr}\) holds the original value of \(\text{dp\_prev}\)

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 3\) where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 2]` which is \((\text{dp\_prev}[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1] + \text{dp\_prev}[2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1]) \% \text{MOD}\), `i` is 1, `left` is \(\max(0, 1 - 2 \times k)\), `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, 1 + 2 \times k) + 1\), \(\text{dp\_curr}[1]\) is \((\text{prefix\_sum}[right] - \text{prefix\_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\), \(\text{dp\_prev}\) holds the original value of \(\text{dp\_curr}[0]\), \(\text{dp\_curr}\) holds the original value of \(\text{dp\_prev}\)**
