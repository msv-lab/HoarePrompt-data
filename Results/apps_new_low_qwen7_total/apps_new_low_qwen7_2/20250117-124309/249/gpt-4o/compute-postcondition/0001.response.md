Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Variables and Their Initial States
- `a`: An integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\)
- `b`: An integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\)
- `k`: An integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 1000\)
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
- `max_diff`: \(2 \cdot k \cdot t\)
- `dp_prev`: A list of integers with length \(2 \cdot \text{max\_diff} + 1\) where all elements are 0 except for the element at index \(\text{max\_diff} + (a - b)\) which is 1
- `dp_curr`: A list of integers with length \(2 \cdot \text{max\_diff} + 1\) where all elements are 0

### For Loop
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis of the Loop Head Conditions
1. **Variable `t`**: The loop runs for \(t\) iterations. Therefore, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute even once.
2. **Variables `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`**: These lists are used in the loop body. However, the initial values and lengths of these lists do not affect whether the loop can execute the first time. They will be updated within the loop.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute the first time, the only condition that needs to be met is that `t` must be at least 1.

### Final State
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
