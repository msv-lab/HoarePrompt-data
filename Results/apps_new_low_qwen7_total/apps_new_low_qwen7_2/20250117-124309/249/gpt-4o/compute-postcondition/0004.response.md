`i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. `prefix_sum[i + 1]` which is `prefix_sum[2]` is updated to the value of `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`. The values of `t`, `prefix_sum`, and `dp_prev` are not specified, so they remain unchanged in their general form. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros; `i` is 1; `prefix_sum[2]` is `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`.
