The code initializes a list `prefix_sum` with zeros, where the length of the list is `2 * max_diff + 3`. However, the value of `max_diff` is not specified in the initial state. Since `t` must be greater than 0, the value of `max_diff` could be any non-negative integer, but we do not have a specific value for it. Therefore, we can express the length of the list in terms of `max_diff`.

The initial state is that `t` must be greater than 0. After executing the code, the list `prefix_sum` is created with the specified length, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros**
