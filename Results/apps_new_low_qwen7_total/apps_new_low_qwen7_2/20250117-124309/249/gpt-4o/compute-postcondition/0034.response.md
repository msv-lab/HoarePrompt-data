The code swaps the values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`. Initially, `dp_curr` holds the updated values based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`, and `dp_prev` holds the original value of `dp_curr`.

After executing the line `dp_prev, dp_curr = dp_curr, dp_prev`:

- The value of `dp_prev` is now the same as the original value of `dp_curr`.
- The value of `dp_curr` is now the updated value, which is the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` must be greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length 2 * `max_diff` + 3 where all elements are 0 except for `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which is (`dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]`) % `MOD`, `i` is 0, `left` is `max(0, i - 2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_prev` now holds the original value of `dp_curr`, `dp_curr` now holds the updated value based on the sum of `prefix_sum` values between `left` and `right`**.
