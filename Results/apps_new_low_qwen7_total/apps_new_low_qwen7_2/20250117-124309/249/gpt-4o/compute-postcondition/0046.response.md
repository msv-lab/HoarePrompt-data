Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`, which ranges from `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 0
   - `left` is `max(0, 0 - 2 * k)`
   - `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 0 + 2 * k) + 1`
   - `dp_curr[0]` is `(prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 0 + 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[max(0, 0 - 2 * k)]) % MOD`
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3`
   - `t > 0`
   - `left` and `right` remain unchanged
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` hold their final updated values

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `2 * max_diff`. 

4. **Update States for Next Iteration**: For the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `1`.

5. **Check Constraints and Adjustments**:
   - `left` remains unchanged.
   - `right` remains unchanged.
   - `prefix_sum` remains unchanged.
   - `t > 0` remains unchanged.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` hold their final updated values.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `left` is `max(0, 0 - 2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 0 + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_curr[0]` is `(prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 0 + 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[max(0, 0 - 2 * k)]) % MOD`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3`, `t > 0`, `left` and `right` remain unchanged, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` hold their final updated values**
