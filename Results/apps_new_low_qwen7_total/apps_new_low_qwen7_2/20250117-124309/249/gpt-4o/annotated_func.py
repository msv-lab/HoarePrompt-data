    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates from `i = max_diff + 1` to `i = 2 * max_diff`.
    #   - Inside the loop, it updates the `result` by adding the value of `dp_prev[i]` to `result` and taking the modulo `MOD`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i` starts at `max_diff + 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `2 * max_diff`.
    #   - `result` is updated in each iteration by adding the value of `dp_prev[i]` and taking the modulo `MOD`.
    #   - `left` and `right` are calculated based on `i` and `k`, but their values do not affect the final `result` as the loop directly accesses `dp_prev[i]`.
    #   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are updated based on the prefix sum but remain invariant in terms of the loop’s effect on `result`.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - After the loop completes, `i` will be \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1\).
    #   - The `result` will be the sum of `dp_prev` values from `max(0, max_diff + 1 - 2k)` to \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1\) modulo `MOD`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The final `result` is consistent with the cumulative addition of `dp_prev` values within the specified range.
    #   - The `prefix_sum` remains unchanged and continues to hold the cumulative sums of `dp_prev` values modulo `MOD`.
    #
    #Thus, the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations is as described above.
    print(result)
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function does not handle the case where `t` is less than 3. If `t < 3`, the loop would not execute, and the initial values of `dp_prev` might not be properly utilized, leading to incorrect results.
- The function assumes that `MOD` is defined and known. If `MOD` is not defined, the function will raise a NameError.
- The function does not check for potential overflow issues when performing arithmetic operations modulo `MOD`.
