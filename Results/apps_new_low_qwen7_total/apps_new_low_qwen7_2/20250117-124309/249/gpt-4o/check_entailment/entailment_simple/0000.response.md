Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Variables**:
   - The code correctly initializes the necessary variables and parameters, including the modulo constant `MOD`, and reads the input values for `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The dynamic programming approach is well-structured, using two arrays (`dp_prev` and `dp_curr`) to store intermediate results. This is appropriate for solving the problem efficiently.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `prefix_sum` ensures that cumulative sums are correctly computed and used to update `dp_curr` values based on the range `[left, right]`. This step is crucial for determining the number of ways to achieve certain score differences.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates `t` times, updating `dp_curr` from `dp_prev` in each iteration. The logic inside the loop is correct and follows the dynamic programming principle.

5. **Result Calculation**:
   - The final result is correctly calculated by summing up relevant values from `dp_prev` and taking the modulo `MOD`. The loop bounds and conditions are correctly set to ensure the desired outcome.

6. **Output**:
   - The output is printed correctly, ensuring the result is displayed as required.

Given the analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to find the number of possible games where Memory ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa. All steps and transformations are logically sound and consistent with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
