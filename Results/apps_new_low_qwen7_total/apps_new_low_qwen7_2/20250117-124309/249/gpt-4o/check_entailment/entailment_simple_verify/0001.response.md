### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of possible outcomes where Memory's final score is strictly greater than Lexa's final score.
   - Each turn, both players add an integer from the range \([-k, k]\) to their current scores.
   - The game has exactly `t` turns.
   - The answer must be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Approach Breakdown**:
   - The solution uses dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the number of ways each player can achieve a certain difference in scores.
   - `max_diff` is calculated as \(2kt\) since the maximum possible difference in scores over `t` turns is \(2kt\).
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` arrays are used to store the DP states.
   - A `prefix_sum` array is used to efficiently compute the sum of elements in a subarray, which helps in updating the `dp_curr` array.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are initialized with size `2 * max_diff + 1`.
     - `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)] = 1` sets the initial state where the difference between Memory's and Lexa's starting scores is considered.
   - **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
     - For each turn, `prefix_sum` is updated to keep running totals of `dp_prev`.
     - `dp_curr` is updated using the prefix sums to calculate the number of ways to achieve each possible score difference.
     - The transition ensures that the next state (`dp_curr`) is computed based on the current state (`dp_prev`).
   - **Result Calculation**:
     - The result is obtained by summing up the values in `dp_prev` from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`, which represents all possible ways Memory can have a higher score than Lexa.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles the constraints \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\), \(1 \leq k \leq 1000\), and \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures the result fits within standard integer limits.

5. **Annotations Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the loop execution.
   - The annotations show that `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are correctly updated through the dynamic programming transitions.
   - The final state after the loop shows that `result` is the sum of `dp_prev` values from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`, which is the correct way to count the number of favorable outcomes where Memory's score is strictly greater than Lexa's.

Based on the detailed analysis and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem and handles all necessary edge cases and constraints.
