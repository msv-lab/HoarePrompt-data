### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The constants `MOD`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t` are read from input and passed to the `func_1` function.
   - `max_diff` is calculated as `2 * k * t`, which defines the range of possible score differences.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are initialized as arrays of length `2 * max_diff + 1`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)]` is set to 1 because this represents the initial condition where the difference in scores is `a - b`.
   - A loop runs `t` times, updating `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` to represent the number of ways to achieve each score difference after each turn.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - `prefix_sum` is initialized to store cumulative sums of `dp_prev` values.
   - For each `i` from 0 to `2 * max_diff`, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to include the cumulative sum of `dp_prev[i]`.

4. **DP Table Update**:
   - For each `i` from 0 to `2 * max_diff`, the value of `dp_curr[i]` is computed using the prefix sum technique, effectively summing up the number of ways to achieve each score difference within the range `[i - 2 * k, i + 2 * k]`.
   - This ensures that the number of valid ways to reach each score difference is correctly propagated across turns.

5. **Result Calculation**:
   - After `t` iterations, the result is calculated by summing up the values of `dp_prev` from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`, which corresponds to the number of ways Memory can end with a strictly higher score than Lexa.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The result is printed, modulo `MOD`.

#### Verification of Correctness:

- **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The code correctly implements a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of valid games. The use of prefix sums ensures that the transitions between states are handled efficiently.
- **Boundary Conditions**: The code correctly handles the boundaries of the score differences, ensuring that all possible outcomes are covered.
- **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is consistently applied, preventing overflow and ensuring the result fits within the required bounds.
- **Initial State**: The initial state is correctly set up to represent the starting score difference between Memory and Lexa.
- **Final State**: The final state correctly sums up the number of valid games where Memory ends with a strictly higher score.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations provided, the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the dynamic programming solution and handles all necessary cases without missing any.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
