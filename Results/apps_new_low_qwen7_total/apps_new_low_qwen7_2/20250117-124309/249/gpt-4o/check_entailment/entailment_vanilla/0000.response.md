### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires calculating the number of possible outcomes where Memory's final score is strictly greater than Lexa's final score.
   - Each turn, both players add an integer from the range \([-k, k]\) to their current scores.
   - The game has exactly `t` turns.
   - The answer must be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Approach Breakdown**:
   - The solution uses dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the number of ways each player can achieve a certain difference in scores.
   - `max_diff` is calculated as \(2kt\) since the maximum possible difference in scores over `t` turns is \(2kt\).
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` arrays are used to store the DP states.
   - A `prefix_sum` array is used to efficiently compute the sum of elements in a subarray, which helps in updating the `dp_curr` array.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are initialized with size `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - **Initial State**: `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)] = 1` sets the initial state where the difference between Memory's and Lexa's starting scores is considered.
   - **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
     - For each turn, `prefix_sum` is updated to keep running totals of `dp_prev`.
     - `dp_curr` is updated using the prefix sums to calculate the number of ways to achieve each possible score difference.
     - The transition ensures that the next state (`dp_curr`) is computed based on the current state (`dp_prev`).
   - **Result Calculation**: The result is obtained by summing up the values in `dp_prev` from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`, which represents all possible ways Memory can have a higher score than Lexa.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles the constraints \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\), \(1 \leq k \leq 1000\), and \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures the result fits within standard integer limits.
