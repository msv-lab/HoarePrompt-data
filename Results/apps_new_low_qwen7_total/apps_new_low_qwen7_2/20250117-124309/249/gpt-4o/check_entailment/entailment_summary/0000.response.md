Reasoning:

The given solution addresses the problem using dynamic programming. However, upon closer inspection, we find several potential issues:

1. **Handling of Small `t` Values**: The code assumes that the main loop runs at least once, but if `t < 3`, the loop would not execute, and the initial values of `dp_prev` might not be properly utilized. This could lead to incorrect results.

2. **Potential Overflow Issues**: Although the code performs arithmetic operations modulo `MOD`, there is no explicit check to ensure that the intermediate results do not overflow before taking the modulo. While Python's built-in types handle large numbers well, it is still good practice to ensure correctness.

3. **Assumption of `MOD`**: The code assumes that `MOD` is defined and known. While this is handled by the global declaration of `MOD`, it is generally good practice to ensure that all necessary constants and variables are properly managed.

Given these points, the code needs some adjustments to ensure it correctly handles all edge cases, particularly when `t < 3`.

Correctness: **False**

To make the code more robust, we should explicitly handle the case where `t < 3` and ensure that all calculations are safe from overflow. Here is a revised version of the code:

```python
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def func_1(a, b, k, t):
    max_diff = 2 * k * t
    dp_prev = [0] * (2 * max_diff + 1)
    dp_curr = [0] * (2 * max_diff + 1)
    
    # Initialize the initial state
    dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)] = 1
    
    # Handle the special case when t < 3
    if t < 3:
        result = 0
        for i in range(max_diff + 1, 2 * max_diff + 1):
            result = (result + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
        print(result)
        return
    
    # Main loop
    for _ in range(t - 1):
        prefix_sum = [0] * (2 * max_diff + 3)
        for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
            prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
        for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
            left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
            right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
            dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
        (dp_prev, dp_curr) = (dp_curr, dp_prev)
    
    result = 0
    for i in range(max_diff + 1, 2 * max_diff + 1):
        result = (result + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
    print(result)

(a, b, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(a, b, k, t)
```

This version of the code explicitly handles the case where `t < 3` and ensures that all calculations are performed safely under modulo `MOD`.
