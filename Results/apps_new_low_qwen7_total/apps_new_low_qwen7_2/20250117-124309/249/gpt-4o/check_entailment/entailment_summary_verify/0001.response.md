### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of possible outcomes where Memory's final score is strictly greater than Lexa's final score.
   - Each turn, both players add an integer from the range \([-k, k]\) to their current scores.
   - The game has exactly `t` turns.
   - The answer must be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Approach Breakdown**:
   - The solution uses dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the number of ways each player can achieve a certain difference in scores.
   - `max_diff` is calculated as \(2kt\) since the maximum possible difference in scores over `t` turns is \(2kt\).
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` arrays are used to store the DP states.
   - A `prefix_sum` array is used to efficiently compute the sum of elements in a subarray, which helps in updating the `dp_curr` array.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are initialized with size `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - **Initial State**: `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)] = 1` sets the initial state where the difference between Memory's and Lexa's starting scores is considered.
   - **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
     - For each turn, `prefix_sum` is updated to keep running totals of `dp_prev`.
     - `dp_curr` is updated using the prefix sums to calculate the number of ways to achieve each possible score difference.
     - The transition ensures that the next state (`dp_curr`) is computed based on the current state (`dp_prev`).
   - **Result Calculation**: The result is obtained by summing up the values in `dp_prev` from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`, which represents all possible ways Memory can have a higher score than Lexa.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles the constraints \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\), \(1 \leq k \leq 1000\), and \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures the result fits within standard integer limits.

5. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function does not handle the case where `t` is less than 3. If `t < 3`, the loop would not execute, and the initial values of `dp_prev` might not be properly utilized, leading to incorrect results.
   - The function assumes that `MOD` is defined and known. If `MOD` is not defined, the function will raise a NameError.
   - The function does not check for potential overflow issues when performing arithmetic operations modulo `MOD`.

### Evaluation:
- The code seems to handle the problem correctly and uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of valid outcomes.
- However, the function summary points out several issues:
  - The function does not handle the case where `t` is less than 3.
  - The function assumes `MOD` is predefined.
  - There are no checks for overflow, which could lead to incorrect results under extreme conditions.

Given these points, while the core logic of the code is sound, the lack of proper handling for edge cases and assumptions about predefined variables can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Final Decision:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is inaccurate due to the lack of handling edge cases and the assumption that `MOD` is predefined without checking its validity.
