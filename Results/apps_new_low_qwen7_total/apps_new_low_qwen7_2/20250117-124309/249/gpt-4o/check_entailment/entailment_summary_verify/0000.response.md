Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summary to validate the original assessment.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Modulo Operation Handling**: The code correctly handles the modulo operation using `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7`. This ensures that the results remain within the required bounds.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The code uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways Memory can end up with a higher score than Lexa. This involves iterating over all possible score differences and updating the DP table accordingly.

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop for `t` iterations is correctly set up to ensure that the DP table is updated for each turn. The initialization of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` arrays is also correct.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The use of a prefix sum array helps in efficiently calculating the cumulative sums, which is essential for the DP transition.

5. **Edge Cases**: The code does not explicitly handle edge cases like `t < 3`. However, since the problem description specifies `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, the loop will always execute at least once. Therefore, this omission does not affect the correctness for the given constraints.

6. **Overflow Issues**: The code performs all arithmetic operations within the bounds of the modulo operation, which prevents overflow issues.

### Validation Against Function Summary:

- **Function Summary 1**: The function does not handle the case where `t` is less than 3. This is not a critical issue because `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1 according to the problem description. However, it is still a minor point that could be improved.
- **Function Summary 2**: The function assumes that `MOD` is defined and known. This is true since `MOD` is defined at the beginning of the program.
- **Function Summary 3**: The function does not check for potential overflow issues when performing arithmetic operations modulo `MOD`. This is already handled correctly by the way the modulo operation is used throughout the code.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the dynamic programming solution and handles the required constraints. The minor points mentioned in the function summaries do not impact the overall correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
