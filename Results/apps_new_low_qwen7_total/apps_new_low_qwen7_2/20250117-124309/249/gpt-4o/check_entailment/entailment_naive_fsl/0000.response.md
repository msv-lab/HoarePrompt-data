Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the dynamic programming solution for the problem. It calculates the number of possible games where Memory ends up with a strictly higher score than Lexa after `t` turns. The approach uses a DP table (`dp_prev` and `dp_curr`) to keep track of the number of ways to achieve each possible score difference. The code handles the modulo operation correctly and iterates through all possible scenarios, ensuring that all valid games are accounted for. Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program seems to cover all necessary cases without missing any. Therefore, it is correct according to the problem description.
