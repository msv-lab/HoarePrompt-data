Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and State Management**:
   - The program initializes the dynamic programming (DP) tables `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` correctly. These tables are used to store the number of ways to achieve each possible difference in scores between Memory and Lexa.
   - The initial condition `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)] = 1` sets the starting point correctly, indicating that there is one way for the initial difference to be \(a - b\).

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - The nested loops correctly update the DP table using prefix sums. This approach efficiently computes the number of ways to reach each possible difference in scores after each turn.
   - The transitions are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure that the numbers remain within manageable limits and to handle large intermediate results.

3. **Final Result Calculation**:
   - The loop that calculates the final result iterates over the relevant range of differences (from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`) and accumulates the number of ways to have a positive difference in scores in favor of Memory.
   - The use of `max(0, max_diff + 1 - 2 * k)` ensures that the loop starts from a valid index, and the modulo operation ensures correctness.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where \(t \geq 3\) correctly. For smaller values of \(t\), the logic still works because the initial condition and transitions are correctly set up.
   - The function checks for potential overflow by using modulo arithmetic throughout the computations.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function does not explicitly handle the case where \(t < 3\). However, the problem constraints guarantee \(t \geq 1\), so this edge case is implicitly handled.
   - The function uses a fixed modulo value (`10^9 + 7`), which is standard for such problems and ensures that results fit within a typical integer range.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly initializes the DP tables, updates them using the appropriate transitions, and calculates the final result.

Correctness: **True**
