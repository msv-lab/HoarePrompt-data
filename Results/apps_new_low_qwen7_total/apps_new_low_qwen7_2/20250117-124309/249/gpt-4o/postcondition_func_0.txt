- The function does not handle the case where `t` is less than 3. If `t < 3`, the loop would not execute, and the initial values of `dp_prev` might not be properly utilized, leading to incorrect results.
- The function assumes that `MOD` is defined and known. If `MOD` is not defined, the function will raise a NameError.
- The function does not check for potential overflow issues when performing arithmetic operations modulo `MOD`.
