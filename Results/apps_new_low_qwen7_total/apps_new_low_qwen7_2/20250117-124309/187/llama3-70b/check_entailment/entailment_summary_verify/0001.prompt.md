You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
    print(max(towers))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts no parameters and reads two non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input. It then creates a set `towers` containing the first \(n\) even numbers starting from 2 and the first \(m\) multiples of 3 starting from 3. Finally, it prints the maximum value present in the `towers` set. If either \(n\) or \(m\) is 0, the set `towers` will only contain the appropriate sequence of numbers based on the non-zero input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by creating a set of all possible tower heights that can be built by the students. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Range of Values**: The program generates towers up to `n` for two-block pieces and `m` for three-block pieces. This is incorrect because it only considers the number of students, not the total height they can achieve. For example, if there are 3 students using two-block pieces, the tallest tower from these students should be `3 * 2 = 6`, not just `3`.

2. **Set of Possible Heights**: The program uses a set to store all possible heights, but this approach does not guarantee the smallest possible maximum height. Instead, we need to ensure that the maximum height among the possible towers is minimized while ensuring all towers have unique heights.

To solve this correctly, we need to generate the heights in such a way that we cover all possible unique heights without missing any and without exceeding the requirement to find the minimum height of the tallest tower.

Here’s the corrected version of the logic:

- Calculate the maximum height that can be achieved by `n` students using two-block pieces.
- Calculate the maximum height that can be achieved by `m` students using three-block pieces.
- Ensure that these heights are unique and cover all necessary values.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    max_two_block_tower = n * 2
    max_three_block_tower = m * 3
    current_height = 2
    used_heights = set()

    # Add all possible heights starting from 2 up to the maximum height needed
    while len(used_heights) < n + m:
        if current_height not in used_heights:
            used_heights.add(current_height)
            if current_height <= max_two_block_tower:
                max_two_block_tower -= current_height
            if current_height <= max_three_block_tower:
                max_three_block_tower -= current_height
        current_height += 1

    print(current_height - 1)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation:

- We initialize `max_two_block_tower` and `max_three_block_tower` to ensure we cover the maximum possible heights.
- We use a loop to add unique heights to the `used_heights` set until we have enough unique heights.
- Once we have enough unique heights, the last added height will be the minimum height of the tallest tower.

### Conclusion:

The original program does not correctly handle the generation of unique heights. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
