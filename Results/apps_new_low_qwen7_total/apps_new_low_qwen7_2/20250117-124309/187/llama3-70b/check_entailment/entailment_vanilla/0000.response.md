### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by creating a set of all possible tower heights that can be built by the students. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Range of Values**: The program generates towers up to `n` for two-block pieces and `m` for three-block pieces. This is incorrect because it only considers the number of students, not the total height they can achieve. For example, if there are 3 students using two-block pieces, the tallest tower from these students should be `3 * 2 = 6`, not just `3`.

2. **Set of Possible Heights**: The program uses a set to store all possible heights, but this approach does not guarantee the smallest possible maximum height. Instead, we need to ensure that the maximum height among the possible towers is minimized while ensuring all towers have unique heights.

To solve this correctly, we need to generate the heights in such a way that we cover all possible unique heights without missing any and without exceeding the requirement to find the minimum height of the tallest tower.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the logic:

- Calculate the maximum height that can be achieved by `n` students using two-block pieces.
- Calculate the maximum height that can be achieved by `m` students using three-block pieces.
- Ensure that these heights are unique and cover all necessary values.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    max_two_block_tower = n * 2
    max_three_block_tower = m * 3
    current_height = 2
    used_heights = set()

    # Add all possible heights starting from 2 up to the maximum height needed
    while len(used_heights) < n + m:
        if current_height not in used_heights:
            used_heights.add(current_height)
            if current_height <= max_two_block_tower:
                max_two_block_tower -= current_height
            if current_height <= max_three_block_tower:
                max_three_block_tower -= current_height
        current_height += 1

    print(current_height - 1)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation:

- We initialize `max_two_block_tower` and `max_three_block_tower` to ensure we cover the maximum possible heights.
- We use a loop to add unique heights to the `used_heights` set until we have enough unique heights.
- Once we have enough unique heights, the last added height will be the minimum height of the tallest tower.

### Conclusion:

The original program does not correctly handle the generation of unique heights. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
