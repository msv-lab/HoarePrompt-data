Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `towers` is a set containing `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n}`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
    #   - In each iteration, the value `i * 2` is added to the set `towers`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
    #   - `n` remains unchanged as it is defined in the loop's initialization.
    #   - `towers` is updated in each iteration by adding `i * 2`.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n + 1` but `i` starts from 1.
    #   - The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run at least once.
    #   - The set `towers` contains the elements `2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n`, which are the even numbers up to `2*n`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The loop adds `i * 2` to `towers` in each iteration, so after `n` iterations, `towers` contains `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n}`.
    #   - The final value of `i` is `n + 1`, but since the loop condition checks `range(1, n + 1)`, the last value of `i` that gets checked is `n`.
    #
    #Thus, the final state after the loop has completed all its iterations is:
    #Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `towers` is a set containing `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n}`.
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `m + 1`; `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `towers` is a set containing `{3, 6, 9, ..., 3*m}`.
    print(max(towers))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads two non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input. It then creates a set `towers` containing the first \(n\) even numbers starting from 2 and the first \(m\) multiples of 3 starting from 3. Finally, it prints the maximum value present in the `towers` set. If either \(n\) or \(m\) is 0, the set `towers` will only contain the appropriate sequence of numbers based on the non-zero input.
