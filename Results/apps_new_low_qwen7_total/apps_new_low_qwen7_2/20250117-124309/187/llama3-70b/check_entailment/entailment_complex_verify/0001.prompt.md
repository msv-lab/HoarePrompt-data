You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
    print(max(towers))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `towers` is a set containing `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n}`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
    #   - In each iteration, the value `i * 2` is added to the set `towers`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
    #   - `n` remains unchanged as it is defined in the loop's initialization.
    #   - `towers` is updated in each iteration by adding `i * 2`.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n + 1` but `i` starts from 1.
    #   - The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run at least once.
    #   - The set `towers` contains the elements `2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n`, which are the even numbers up to `2*n`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The loop adds `i * 2` to `towers` in each iteration, so after `n` iterations, `towers` contains `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n}`.
    #   - The final value of `i` is `n + 1`, but since the loop condition checks `range(1, n + 1)`, the last value of `i` that gets checked is `n`.
    #
    #Thus, the final state after the loop has completed all its iterations is:
    #Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `towers` is a set containing `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n}`.
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `m + 1`; `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `towers` is a set containing `{3, 6, 9, ..., 3*m}`.
    print(max(towers))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads two non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input. It then creates a set `towers` containing the first \(n\) even numbers starting from 2 and the first \(m\) multiples of 3 starting from 3. Finally, it prints the maximum value present in the `towers` set. If either \(n\) or \(m\) is 0, the set `towers` will only contain the appropriate sequence of numbers based on the non-zero input.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by creating a set of all possible tower heights that can be built by the students. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Range of Values**: The program generates towers up to `n` for two-block pieces and `m` for three-block pieces. This is incorrect because it only considers the number of students, not the total height they can achieve. For example, if there are 3 students using two-block pieces, the tallest tower from these students should be `3 * 2 = 6`, not just `3`.

2. **Set of Possible Heights**: The program uses a set to store all possible heights, but this approach does not guarantee the smallest possible maximum height. Instead, we need to ensure that the maximum height among the possible towers is minimized while ensuring all towers have unique heights.

To solve this correctly, we need to generate the heights in such a way that we cover all possible unique heights without missing any and without exceeding the requirement to find the minimum height of the tallest tower.

Here’s the corrected version of the logic:

- Calculate the maximum height that can be achieved by `n` students using two-block pieces.
- Calculate the maximum height that can be achieved by `m` students using three-block pieces.
- Ensure that these heights are unique and cover all necessary values.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    max_two_block_tower = n * 2
    max_three_block_tower = m * 3
    current_height = 2
    used_heights = set()

    # Add all possible heights starting from 2 up to the maximum height needed
    while len(used_heights) < n + m:
        if current_height not in used_heights:
            used_heights.add(current_height)
            if current_height <= max_two_block_tower:
                max_two_block_tower -= current_height
            if current_height <= max_three_block_tower:
                max_three_block_tower -= current_height
        current_height += 1

    print(current_height - 1)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation:

- We initialize `max_two_block_tower` and `max_three_block_tower` to ensure we cover the maximum possible heights.
- We use a loop to add unique heights to the `used_heights` set until we have enough unique heights.
- Once we have enough unique heights, the last added height will be the minimum height of the tallest tower.

### Conclusion:

The original program does not correctly handle the generation of unique heights. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
