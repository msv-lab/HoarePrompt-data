You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
    print(max(towers))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `towers` is a set containing `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n}`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
    #   - In each iteration, the value `i * 2` is added to the set `towers`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
    #   - `n` remains unchanged as it is defined in the loop's initialization.
    #   - `towers` is updated in each iteration by adding `i * 2`.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n + 1` but `i` starts from 1.
    #   - The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run at least once.
    #   - The set `towers` contains the elements `2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n`, which are the even numbers up to `2*n`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The loop adds `i * 2` to `towers` in each iteration, so after `n` iterations, `towers` contains `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n}`.
    #   - The final value of `i` is `n + 1`, but since the loop condition checks `range(1, n + 1)`, the last value of `i` that gets checked is `n`.
    #
    #Thus, the final state after the loop has completed all its iterations is:
    #Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `towers` is a set containing `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n}`.
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `m + 1`; `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `towers` is a set containing `{3, 6, 9, ..., 3*m}`.
    print(max(towers))



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that no two students' towers may contain the same number of blocks. The current implementation generates a set of possible tower heights using two-block and three-block pieces but does not ensure that the generated heights are unique for each student. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 2`, the program will generate the heights `{2, 4}` for two-block pieces and `{3, 6}` for three-block pieces, which results in duplicate heights (4 is repeated). This violates the condition that no two students' towers may contain the same number of blocks.

To fix this, the program needs to generate unique heights for each student. One way to do this is to sort the possible heights and assign them sequentially to each student. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = []
    two_block_heights = [i * 2 for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    three_block_heights = [i * 3 for i in range(1, m + 1)]
    
    # Combine and sort the possible heights
    towers.extend(sorted(two_block_heights + three_block_heights))
    
    # Assign the tallest height to the last student
    print(towers[-1])
```

This corrected version ensures that each student gets a unique height and that the tallest tower is correctly calculated.
