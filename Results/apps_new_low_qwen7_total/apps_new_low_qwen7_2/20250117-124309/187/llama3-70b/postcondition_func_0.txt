The function accepts no parameters and reads two non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input. It then creates a set `towers` containing the first \(n\) even numbers starting from 2 and the first \(m\) multiples of 3 starting from 3. Finally, it prints the maximum value present in the `towers` set. If either \(n\) or \(m\) is 0, the set `towers` will only contain the appropriate sequence of numbers based on the non-zero input.
