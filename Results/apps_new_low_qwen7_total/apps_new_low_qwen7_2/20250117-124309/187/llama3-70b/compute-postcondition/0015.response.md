The code `print(max(towers))` does not change the values of the variables. Instead, it prints the maximum value in the set `towers`. Since `towers` is a set containing `{3, 6, 9, ..., 3*m}`, the maximum value in this set is `3*m`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State because no new values are assigned to the variables.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`; `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `towers` is a set containing `{3, 6, 9, ..., 3*m}; the maximum value printed is `3*m`.**
