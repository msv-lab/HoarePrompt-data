Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is defined in the loop's initialization.
   - No other variables are mentioned to be modified within the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will start when `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range specified by `range(1, m + 1)`.

4. **Determine Initial Conditions**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be 1.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run at least once.

5. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop condition checks `range(1, m + 1)`, meaning the loop will run if `m >= 1`.
   - At the beginning of the loop, `i` should be set to 1.

Given this analysis, we can summarize the conditions that must hold true for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
