The code adds `i * 2` to the `towers` set. Given that `i` is 3, `i * 2` equals 6. Therefore, the set `towers` will contain the elements {2, 4, 6}. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial state, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `towers` is a set containing {2, 4, 6}**
