The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle the conditions specified by the constraints on `n` and `m`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). However, since no specific output or behavior is provided beyond the parameter constraints, the function likely returns a value or performs an action based on these constraints.

Given the lack of specific output details, we can infer that the function might return a boolean indicating whether the conditions are met. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean indicating whether the conditions \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\) are satisfied.**
