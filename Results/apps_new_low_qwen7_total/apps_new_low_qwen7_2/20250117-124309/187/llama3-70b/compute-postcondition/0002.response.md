`towers.add(i * 2)` adds the value of `i * 2` to the set `towers`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, the value of `i * 2` is `2`. Since `i` is initially 1, `i` itself is not changed by this operation. The set `towers` now contains the value 2.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `towers` is a set containing {2}**
