Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `towers` is a set containing `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n}`.

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - In each iteration, the value `i * 2` is added to the set `towers`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is defined in the loop's initialization.
   - `towers` is updated in each iteration by adding `i * 2`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n + 1` but `i` starts from 1.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run at least once.
   - The set `towers` contains the elements `2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n`, which are the even numbers up to `2*n`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop adds `i * 2` to `towers` in each iteration, so after `n` iterations, `towers` contains `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n}`.
   - The final value of `i` is `n + 1`, but since the loop condition checks `range(1, n + 1)`, the last value of `i` that gets checked is `n`.

Thus, the final state after the loop has completed all its iterations is:
Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `towers` is a set containing `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n}`.
