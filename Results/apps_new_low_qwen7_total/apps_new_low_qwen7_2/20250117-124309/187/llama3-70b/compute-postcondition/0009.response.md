`towers.add(i * 3)` adds the value of `i * 3` to the set `towers`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `i * 3` equals 3. Since `towers` was not defined in the initial state and no default set is mentioned, we assume `towers` is an empty set before this operation. After adding 3 to the set, `towers` becomes `{3}`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `towers` is {3}**
