The code `towers.add(i * 2)` adds the value of `i * 2` to the set `towers`. Given that `i` is 2, `i * 2` equals 4. The set `towers` initially contains the element 2. After adding 4, the set `towers` will contain the elements 2 and 4.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `towers` is a set containing {2, 4}**
