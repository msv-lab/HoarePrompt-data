`towers.add(i * 3)` adds the value of `i * 3` to the set `towers`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `i * 3` equals 6. Since `towers` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty set before this operation. After adding 6 to the set, the set `towers` contains the element 6.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `m` must be greater than or equal to 2; `towers` is {6}**
