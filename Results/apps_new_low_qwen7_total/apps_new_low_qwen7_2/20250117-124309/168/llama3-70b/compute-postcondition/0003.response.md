Output State: **a is a non-empty string, b is a non-empty string, i is 1, j is 1, ans is a list containing the character at index 0 of a (or equivalently index 0 of b)**

Explanation:
- The first line appends the character at index `i` (which is initially 0) in `a` to the list `ans`. After this operation, `ans` contains the first character of `a`.
- The second and third lines increment both `i` and `j` by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 1 and `j` becomes 1. The character at index `i` in `a` is now the same as the character at index `j` in `b`, which is consistent with the initial condition.
