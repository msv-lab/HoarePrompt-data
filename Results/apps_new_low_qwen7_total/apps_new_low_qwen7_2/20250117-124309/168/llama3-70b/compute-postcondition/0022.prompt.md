You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, and the length of each string does not exceed 10^5 characters.
def func():
    a = input()

b = input()

i = 0

j = 0

ans = []
    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            ans.append(a[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: a is a non-empty string, b is a non-empty string, i is equal to len(a), j is equal to len(b), ans is a list containing all characters that are common and in the same positions in both strings a and b. The loop continues executing as long as there are characters left to compare in both strings a and b. If one string ends before the other, the loop stops.
    if (len(ans) == 0) :
        print('-')
    else :
        print(''.join(ans))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, `ans` is a list containing all characters that are common and in the same positions in both strings `a` and `b`. If the length of `ans` is 0, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `ans` contains characters common in the same positions in both `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase letters, and returns `True` if `a` and `b` are anagrams of each other, otherwise it returns `False`.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
