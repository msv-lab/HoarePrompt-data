Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) and j < len(b)`.
2. **Check Each Variable in the Loop Condition**:
   - `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - `j` must be less than `len(b)`.

3. **Initial Values Before the Loop**:
   - `a` is a non-empty string.
   - `b` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `ans` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop condition).

4. **Determine Adjustments Needed**:
   - For `i < len(a)` to be true, `i` (which is 0) must be less than the length of `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty string, `len(a)` is at least 1. Therefore, `i` being 0 satisfies this condition.
   - For `j < len(b)` to be true, `j` (which is 0) must be less than the length of `b`. Since `b` is a non-empty string, `len(b)` is at least 1. Therefore, `j` being 0 satisfies this condition.

Since both conditions (`i < len(a)` and `j < len(b)`) are already satisfied with the given initial values, no adjustments are needed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
