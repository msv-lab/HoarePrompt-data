Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase letters, and prints a string containing all characters that are common and in the same positions in both strings `a` and `b`. If no such characters exist, it prints a hyphen ('-'). The function does not return anything; instead, it modifies the variable `ans` to contain the common characters and then prints them.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If either `a` or `b` is empty, the function should not execute because the initial inputs are non-empty strings. However, since the code assumes both `a` and `b` are non-empty, this edge case is handled correctly.
- If `a` and `b` have different lengths, the loop will stop when the shorter string ends, ensuring that only characters up to the length of the shorter string are considered.

**Missing functionality:**
- The annotation mentions that `a` and `b` are non-empty strings, but the function does not check this condition explicitly. While the input is assumed to be non-empty due to the way the function is called, it would be more robust to add explicit checks for this condition.
- The function does not handle the case where `a` and `b` might contain special characters or numbers, which are not mentioned in the problem statement but could be relevant depending on the broader context.
