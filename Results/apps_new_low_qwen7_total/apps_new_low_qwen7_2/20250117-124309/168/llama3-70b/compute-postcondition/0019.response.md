The code `print(''.join(ans))` does not change any of the variables' values. It only prints the concatenation of the elements in the list `ans`. The list `ans` remains unchanged and still contains characters that are common and in the same positions in both strings `a` and `b`. 

Output State: **a is a non-empty string, b is a non-empty string, i is equal to len(a), j is equal to len(b), ans is a list containing all characters that are common and in the same positions in both strings a and b, and the length of ans is greater than 0**
