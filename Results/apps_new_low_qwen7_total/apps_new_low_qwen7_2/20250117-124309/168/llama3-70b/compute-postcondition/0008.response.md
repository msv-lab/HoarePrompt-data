Initial State: `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `j` is either 1 or 0

Code Block:
```
ans.append(a[i])
i += 1
j += 1
```

Analysis:
- The first line `ans.append(a[i])` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is initially 2, it appends `a[2]` to `ans`.
- The second line `i += 1` increments `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- The third line `j += 1` increments `j` by 1, so if `j` was initially 1, it now becomes 2; if `j` was initially 0, it now becomes 1.

Final Output State: **a is a non-empty string, b is a non-empty string, i is 3, j is either 2 or 1, ans is [a[2]]**
