The loop condition is `i < len(a) and j < len(b)`. To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that both `i` and `j` satisfy their respective conditions.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a non-empty string
- `b` is a non-empty string
- `i` is 3
- `j` is either 1 or 0
- `ans` is `[a[2]]` if `a[3] == b[1]` or `[a[2]]` otherwise

For the loop to continue:
1. `i` must be less than the length of `a`.
2. `j` must be less than the length of `b`.

Given `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, the length of `a` must be greater than 3. Given `j` is either 1 or 0, for the loop to continue, the length of `b` must be greater than 0 (which is already satisfied since `b` is a non-empty string).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` must be less than the length of `a`, so the length of `a` must be greater than 3.
- `j` must be less than the length of `b`, which is already satisfied as `b` is a non-empty string.

State: **`a` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 3, `b` is a non-empty string, `i` is 3, `j` is either 1 or 0, and `ans` is `[a[2]]` if `a[3] == b[1]` or `[a[2]]` otherwise**
