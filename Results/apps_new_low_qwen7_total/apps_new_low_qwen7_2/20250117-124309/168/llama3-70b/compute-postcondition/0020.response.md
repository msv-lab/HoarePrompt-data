Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, `ans` is a list containing all characters that are common and in the same positions in both strings `a` and `b`. If the length of `ans` is 0, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `ans` contains characters common in the same positions in both `a` and `b`.**
