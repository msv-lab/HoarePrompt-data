The code `print('-')` prints a hyphen to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **a is a non-empty string, b is a non-empty string, i is equal to len(a), j is equal to len(b), ans is a list containing all characters that are common and in the same positions in both strings a and b, and the length of ans is 0**
