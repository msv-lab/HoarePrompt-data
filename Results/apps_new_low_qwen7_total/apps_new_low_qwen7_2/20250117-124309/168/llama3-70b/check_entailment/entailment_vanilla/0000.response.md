### Reasoning:

The given program aims to find the longest subsequence of string `a` that matches a substring of string `b`. The approach used in the program is to iterate through both strings `a` and `b` simultaneously, and whenever a character in `a` matches a character in `b`, it appends that character to the list `ans`. If there is a mismatch, it simply moves to the next character in `a`.

Let's break down the key points to verify correctness:

1. **Matching Characters**: The program correctly checks for matching characters between `a` and `b` and appends them to `ans`.
2. **Non-Matching Characters**: When characters do not match, the program only increments the index of `a` to continue searching.
3. **Handling Empty Result**: If no characters match, the program prints `-`.
4. **Output Format**: The result is printed as a single string using `''.join(ans)`.

This approach ensures that we are collecting the maximum possible consecutive matching characters from `b` that form a subsequence of `a`. Since the problem allows removing the minimum number of consecutive characters from `b` to make it a subsequence of `a`, this method effectively achieves that goal by ensuring the collected characters are in order and from `a`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correctly solving the problem as specified.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
