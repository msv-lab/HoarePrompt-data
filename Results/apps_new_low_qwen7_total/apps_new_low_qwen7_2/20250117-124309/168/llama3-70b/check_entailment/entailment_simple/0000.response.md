### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The code correctly reads the input strings `a` and `b`.
   - Variables `i` and `j` are initialized to iterate through `a` and `b`, respectively.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through both strings `a` and `b` simultaneously.
   - If the current character of `a` matches the current character of `b`, the character is appended to `ans`, and both indices `i` and `j` are incremented.
   - If the current character of `a` does not match the current character of `b`, only index `i` is incremented, moving on to the next character in `a`.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `ans` is empty.
   - If `ans` is empty, it prints `-`.
   - Otherwise, it joins the elements of `ans` into a single string and prints it.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where no common characters are found (empty `ans`).
   - It ensures that only characters that appear in the same position in both `a` and `b` are considered.

5. **Consistency with Problem Description**:
   - The solution ensures that the output is a subsequence of `a` and is derived from the characters of `b` by removing the minimum number of consecutive characters.
   - The solution does not remove any unnecessary characters and respects the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program meets all the requirements of the problem statement and correctly implements the logic to find the longest subsequence of `a` that can be obtained by removing the minimum number of consecutive characters from `b`.

### Correctness:
**True**
