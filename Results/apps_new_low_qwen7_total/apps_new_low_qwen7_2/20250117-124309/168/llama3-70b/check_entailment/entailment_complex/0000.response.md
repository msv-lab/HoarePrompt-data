Reasoning:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function `func()` takes two parameters `a` and `b`, which are strings as described in the problem statement.
2. **Reading Input**: The function reads two lines of input and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively.
3. **Initialization**: Two pointers `i` and `j` are initialized to 0, representing the current index in strings `a` and `b`, respectively. A list `ans` is initialized to store characters that are common and in the same positions in both strings.
4. **Main Loop**: The loop iterates through both strings until one of them is fully traversed. If the characters at the current indices match, the character is added to `ans`, and both indices are incremented. If they do not match, only the index of `a` is incremented.
5. **Output**: After the loop, if `ans` is empty, the function prints `-`. Otherwise, it prints the concatenated string of `ans`.

Given the logic of the function, it correctly implements the requirement to find the longest common subsequence of `b` in `a` by removing the minimum number of consecutive characters from `b`. This approach ensures that we consider only characters that appear in the same position in both strings, which is consistent with the definition of a subsequence for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
