You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two strings a and b. You have to remove the minimum possible number of consecutive (standing one after another) characters from string b in such a way that it becomes a subsequence of string a. It can happen that you will not need to remove any characters at all, or maybe you will have to remove all of the characters from b and make it empty.

Subsequence of string s is any such string that can be obtained by erasing zero or more characters (not necessarily consecutive) from string s.


-----Input-----

The first line contains string a, and the second line — string b. Both of these strings are nonempty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is no bigger than 10^5 characters.


-----Output-----

On the first line output a subsequence of string a, obtained from b by erasing the minimum number of consecutive characters.

If the answer consists of zero characters, output «-» (a minus sign).


-----Examples-----
Input
hi
bob

Output
-

Input
abca
accepted

Output
ac

Input
abacaba
abcdcba

Output
abcba



-----Note-----

In the first example strings a and b don't share any symbols, so the longest string that you can get is empty.

In the second example ac is a subsequence of a, and at the same time you can obtain it by erasing consecutive symbols cepted from string b.

- Program: 
def func():
    a = input()
    b = input()
    i = 0
    j = 0
    ans = []
    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            ans.append(a[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    if len(ans) == 0:
        print('-')
    else:
        print(''.join(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, and the length of each string does not exceed 10^5 characters.
def func():
    a = input()

b = input()

i = 0

j = 0

ans = []
    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            ans.append(a[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: a is a non-empty string, b is a non-empty string, i is equal to len(a), j is equal to len(b), ans is a list containing all characters that are common and in the same positions in both strings a and b. The loop continues executing as long as there are characters left to compare in both strings a and b. If one string ends before the other, the loop stops.
    if (len(ans) == 0) :
        print('-')
    else :
        print(''.join(ans))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, `ans` is a list containing all characters that are common and in the same positions in both strings `a` and `b`. If the length of `ans` is 0, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `ans` contains characters common in the same positions in both `a` and `b`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where removing a segment of consecutive characters from `b` can make it a subsequence of `a`, even if adding more characters from `a` is not done consecutively. For example, consider the input:

```
Input:
abacaba
abcdcba

Output:
abcba
```

According to the problem description, the program should find the minimum number of consecutive characters to remove from `b` to make it a subsequence of `a`. However, the current implementation only checks for matching characters and appends them to `ans` without considering the possibility of removing a longer segment of consecutive characters from `b`.

For instance, in the given example, the program outputs `abcba`, which is a valid subsequence, but it could have removed more characters from `b` to achieve the same result. A more optimal solution would be to check all possible segments of consecutive characters in `b` and see if removing them results in a valid subsequence of `a`.
