The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase letters, and prints a string containing all characters that are common and in the same positions in both strings `a` and `b`. If no such characters exist, it prints a hyphen ('-'). The function does not return anything; instead, it modifies the variable `ans` to contain the common characters and then prints them.
