Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses the `range(2)` function, which generates values from 0 to 1 (inclusive).
   - The loop variable `_` is used, which typically represents an unused index.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The condition for the loop to execute is determined by the range function.
   - The range `range(2)` will generate 2 iterations: `_ = 0` and `_ = 1`.

3. **Initial State Provided:**
   - We are given that `n` must be greater than 0 (`n > 0`).

4. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we focus on the initialization and condition checks.
   - The loop will execute as long as the condition for the `range` function holds true.

5. **Ensure Loop Executes the First Time:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the loop should start with `_ = 0`.
   - The loop will then proceed to the second iteration with `_ = 1`.

6. **Verify Initial State:**
   - The initial state provided is that `n` must be greater than 0.
   - This ensures that the loop can execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
