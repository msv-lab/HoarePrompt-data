Postcondition: ***`dx` is the x-component of the direction vector at the new `direction_index`, `dy` is the y-component of the direction vector at the new `direction_index`, `x` is updated to the new position along the x-axis, `y` is updated to the new position along the y-axis, `direction_index` is updated, `n` is decreased by `steps` if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`. Otherwise, `x` is updated to the original `x` plus `dx` multiplied by `n`, and `y` is updated to the original `y` plus `dy` multiplied by `n`.***
