The initial state is: `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and `n` is less than `steps`.

The code snippet is:
```
dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
x += dx * n
y += dy * n
```

This snippet assumes the existence of variables `directions`, `direction_index`, `x`, and `y`, which are not specified in the initial state. However, we can infer the following:

1. `dx` and `dy` are obtained from `directions[direction_index]`, which means these are direction components (e.g., `(1, 0)` for right, `(-1, 0)` for left, `(0, 1)` for up, `(0, -1)` for down).
2. `x` and `y` are updated by adding `dx * n` and `dy * n` respectively.

Since the exact values of `directions`, `direction_index`, `x`, and `y` are not given, we can still determine the effects on the variables mentioned in the initial state and those modified by the code.

The code does not modify `_` or `n`'s relationship to `steps`, so `_` remains 0, and the condition `n < steps` is maintained. It updates `x` and `y` based on `dx` and `dy`.

Therefore, the final state is:
Output State: **n must be greater than 0, _ is 0, x is updated by adding dx * n to its original value, y is updated by adding dy * n to its original value**
