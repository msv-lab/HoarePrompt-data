To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the condition for the `while` loop.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `directions` is a list of tuples representing different directions: \((-1, 1)\), \((1, 0)\), \((0, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((1, -1)\), \((0, 1)\).
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `steps` is 1.
- `direction_index` is 0.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while n > 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop condition is `n > 0`. This means the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The variables involved in the loop condition are `n`.

### Current State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).

### Determining the Necessary Condition:
For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` can range from 0 to \(10^{18}\), the only way to ensure the loop executes is to make sure `n` is not 0.

### Conclusion:
To allow the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
