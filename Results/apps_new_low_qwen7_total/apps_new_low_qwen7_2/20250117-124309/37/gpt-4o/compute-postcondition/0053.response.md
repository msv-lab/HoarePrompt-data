Initial State:
- `x` is 5
- `y` is 0
- `n` is 1
- `direction_index` is 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`. Otherwise, `n` is 3, and `direction_index` remains unchanged.

Code Block:
```python
dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
x += dx * n
y += dy * n
```

Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **`dx, dy = directions[direction_index]`**: This line assigns the values of `dx` and `dy` from the `directions` list based on the current value of `direction_index`.
2. **`x += dx * n`**: This line updates `x` by adding the product of `dx` and `n` to the current value of `x`.
3. **`y += dy * n`**: This line updates `y` by adding the product of `dy` and `n` to the current value of `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is 5
- `y` is 0
- `n` is 1
- `direction_index` is 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`. Otherwise, `n` is 3, and `direction_index` remains unchanged.

We need to determine the value of `direction_index` based on the condition `n >= steps`. However, since the value of `steps` is not provided, we will assume that `n` is less than `steps` unless otherwise specified. Therefore, `direction_index` remains 2.

For simplicity, let's assume `directions` is a predefined list where `directions[2]` corresponds to some specific direction (e.g., `directions[2] = (1, 1)`).

So, `dx` and `dy` are set to 1 and 1 respectively.

Now, let's perform the calculations:
- `x += dx * n`: `x` becomes `5 + 1 * 1 = 6`
- `y += dy * n`: `y` becomes `0 + 1 * 1 = 1`

Thus, after executing the code block, the new values are:
- `x` is 6
- `y` is 1
- `n` is still 1 (unchanged)
- `direction_index` is still 2 (unchanged)

Output State: **x is 6, y is 1, n is 1, direction_index is 2**
