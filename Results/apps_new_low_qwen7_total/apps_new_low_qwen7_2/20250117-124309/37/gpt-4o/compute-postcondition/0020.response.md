To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions:

1. The loop condition is `n > 0`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `n` is decremented by `4 * steps_taken_in_first_iteration + 2`
   - `steps` is incremented by 2
   - `x` is incremented by `dx * (2 * steps_taken_in_first_iteration + 1)`
   - `y` is incremented by `dy * (2 * steps_taken_in_first_iteration + 1)`

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `n > 0` must still be true after the adjustments made in the loop body.

Given that the only variable involved in the loop condition is `n`, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

Let's denote the value of `n` after the decrement as \( n_{new} \):
\[ n_{new} = n - (4 \cdot \text{steps\_taken\_in\_first\_iteration} + 2) \]

Since the loop will continue as long as \( n_{new} > 0 \), we need to ensure that \( n_{new} > 0 \).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
\[ n \text{ must be greater than } 4 \cdot \text{steps\_taken\_in\_first\_iteration} + 2 \]

State: **`n` must be greater than \( 4 \cdot \text{steps\_taken\_in\_first\_iteration} + 2 \)**
