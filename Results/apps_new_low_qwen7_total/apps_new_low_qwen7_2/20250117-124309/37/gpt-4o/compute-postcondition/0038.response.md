`steps` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `direction_index`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is reduced by 2 * steps, `direction_index` is (`direction_index` + 2) % 6, `x` and `y` are updated based on the direction vectors and the final value of `n`; `steps` is increased by 1.**
