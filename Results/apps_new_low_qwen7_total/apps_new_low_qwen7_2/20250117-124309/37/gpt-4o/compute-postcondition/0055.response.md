Based on the provided information and the structure of the if-else statement, we need to combine the postconditions from both the if and else parts, considering the initial state and the conditions under which each part executes.

**Precondition:** `x` is 5, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `direction_index` is 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`. Otherwise, `n` is 3, and `direction_index` remains unchanged.

**If Part Postcondition:** `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `direction_index` is 3

**Else Part Postcondition:** The program returns `x` that is 6 and `y` that is 1

To form the overall postcondition, we need to consider the initial state and how the if-else block affects it:

1. **If Condition (n >= steps):** This condition is checked, but since `n` starts at 0 and `steps` is not specified, this condition would not be true initially. Therefore, the if part does not execute, and the state remains as follows:
   - `x` is 5
   - `y` is 0
   - `n` is 0
   - `direction_index` is 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`. Otherwise, `n` is 3, and `direction_index` remains unchanged.

2. **Else Condition:** Since the if condition is false, the else part executes. The postcondition of the else part states:
   - The program returns `x` that is 6 and `y` that is 1

Given that the else part executes, the final state of the program after the if-else block is:

**Postcondition:** ***`x` is 6, `y` is 1, `n` is 0, `direction_index` is 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`. Otherwise, `n` is 3, and `direction_index` remains unchanged.***
