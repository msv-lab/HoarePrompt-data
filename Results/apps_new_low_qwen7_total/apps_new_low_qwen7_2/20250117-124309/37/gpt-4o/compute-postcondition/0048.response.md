First, let's analyze the given code block:

Initial State: `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `n` is 3, `direction_index` is 1

Code Block:
```python
dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
x += dx * n
y += dy * n
```

From the code, we can infer the following:
- `directions` is assumed to be a list of tuples where each tuple contains the change in `x` (`dx`) and `y` (`dy`) for a specific direction. Given that `direction_index` is 1, it implies we should look at the second element in the `directions` list.
- `x` and `y` are updated by adding `dx * n` and `dy * n` respectively.

Since the exact `directions` list is not provided, let's assume a common scenario where `directions` could be something like `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`. This means `direction_index` 1 corresponds to the second tuple `(1, 0)`.

So, `dx` would be 1 and `dy` would be 0. Now we can proceed with the calculation:

1. `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]` sets `dx` to 1 and `dy` to 0.
2. `x += dx * n` updates `x` to `2 + 1 * 3 = 5`.
3. `y += dy * n` updates `y` to `0 + 0 * 3 = 0`.

The variables `direction_index`, `n`, and `directions` remain unchanged.

Output State: **x is 5, y is 0, n is 3, direction_index is 1, directions is [(dx1, dy1), (1, 0), (dx3, dy3), (dx4, dy4)]**
