Output State: **n is greater than or equal to steps - 1, direction_index is (direction_index + 1) % 6, x is updated by dx * steps, y is updated by dy * steps**

Explanation:
- The first line unpacks the `dx` and `dy` values from the `directions` list at the index `direction_index`.
- The second and third lines update the `x` and `y` coordinates by moving them by `dx * steps` and `dy * steps` respectively.
- The fourth line decrements `n` by `steps`.
- The fifth line updates `direction_index` to the next index in the `directions` list using modulo 6 to ensure it wraps around if it reaches the end of the list.

Since the initial value of `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, after decrementing `n` by `steps`, `n` will still be greater than or equal to `steps - 1`. The `direction_index` is updated to the next value in the `directions` list, ensuring it cycles through the list. The exact values of `x` and `y` depend on the `dx`, `dy`, and `steps` values, which are not provided, so they are left in a general form based on the operations performed.
