Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the original value minus n, steps is decremented by the number of steps taken minus n, direction_index is updated to the next direction modulo 6, x is incremented by dx * n, y is incremented by dy * n, _ is 0**

Explanation:
1. The first line unpacks the tuple `directions[direction_index]` into `dx` and `dy`.
2. The second line increments `x` by `dx * n`.
3. The third line increments `y` by `dy * n`.

The precondition states that `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the original value, `steps` is decremented by the number of steps taken, `direction_index` is updated to the next direction modulo 6, and `_` is 0. After executing the code, `n` becomes greater than or equal to 0 and less than the original value minus `n`, `steps` becomes decremented by the number of steps taken minus `n`, and `direction_index` is updated to the next direction modulo 6. The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on `dx` and `dy` multiplied by `n`. The variable `_` remains unchanged.
