Postcondition: ***`n` is decremented from its value after the first iteration, `steps` is decremented by the number of steps taken in the first iteration, `direction_index` is updated to the next direction modulo 6, `x` is incremented by `dx * n`, and `y` is incremented by `dy * n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, `steps` and `n` are both decremented by the number of steps taken in the first iteration, and `x` is incremented by `dx * steps`, `y` is incremented by `dy * steps`. Otherwise, the function returns `x` and `y` where `x` is incremented by `dx * n` and `y` is incremented by `dy * n`.***
