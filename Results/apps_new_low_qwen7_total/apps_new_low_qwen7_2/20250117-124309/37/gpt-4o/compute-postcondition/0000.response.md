Output State: **n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^18, directions is [(-1, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, -1), (0, 1)], x is 0, y is 0, steps is 1, direction_index is 0**

Explanation:
- The initial state of `n` is given as an integer within the range 0 to \(10^{18}\).
- The list `directions` is initialized with six tuples representing different movement directions: diagonal up-right, right, down, left, diagonal down-left, and up.
- Variables `x` and `y` are both set to 0, indicating the starting position at coordinates (0, 0).
- `steps` is set to 1, indicating the number of steps taken so far.
- `direction_index` is set to 0, which could be considered the index of the first direction in the `directions` list.

Since no further operations or changes to these variables are performed in the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged.
