Let's analyze the given code block and its impact on the variables step by step:

### Initial State:
- `x` is 5
- `y` is 0
- `n` is 1
- `direction_index` is 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`. Otherwise, `n` is 3, and `direction_index` remains unchanged.

### Code Block:
```python
dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
x += dx * steps
y += dy * steps
n -= steps
direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6
```

### Analysis:
1. **`dx, dy = directions[direction_index]`**:
   - `directions` is assumed to be a predefined list of tuples representing directions. Let's assume `directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)]`.
   - Since `direction_index` is 2 initially, `directions[2]` will be `(-1, 0)`. So, `dx = -1` and `dy = 0`.

2. **`x += dx * steps`**:
   - `steps` is assumed to be 1 (common default value if not specified).
   - Therefore, `x += -1 * 1` which means `x -= 1`. So, `x` becomes `5 - 1 = 4`.

3. **`y += dy * steps`**:
   - Similarly, `y += 0 * 1` which means `y` remains unchanged. So, `y` is still `0`.

4. **`n -= steps`**:
   - Again, assuming `steps` is 1, `n -= 1`. So, `n` becomes `1 - 1 = 0`.

5. **`direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6`**:
   - Initially, `direction_index` is 2. Adding 1 gives `3`. Taking modulo 6 gives `3`. So, `direction_index` becomes `3`.

### Final State:
- `x` is 4
- `y` is 0
- `n` is 0
- `direction_index` is 3

### Output State:
Output State: **`x` is 4, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `direction_index` is 3**
