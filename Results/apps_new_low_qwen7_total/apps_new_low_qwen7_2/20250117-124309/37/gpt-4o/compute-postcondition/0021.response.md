To determine the state of the objects before the first iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that control the loop's execution. The loop itself is defined as follows:

```python
for _ in range(2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop will execute twice, but we are specifically interested in the conditions necessary for the first iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Control Variables**: The loop control variable here is `range(2)`, which means the loop will run 2 times. However, we are focusing on the condition under which the loop can start its first iteration.

2. **Initial Condition Provided**: We know that before the loop starts, `n` must be greater than \( 4 \cdot \text{steps\_taken\_in\_first\_iteration} + 2 \).

3. **First Iteration Consideration**: For the first iteration, the condition `range(2)` is valid because the loop will start with `0` (the first element of the range). This means the loop will definitely execute the first time without any additional constraints beyond what is provided.

4. **Relevant Variables**: The key variable here is `n`. The value of `n` must satisfy the given condition to allow the loop to start. Since the loop body itself does not modify `n` or introduce new variables that affect the loop condition, the only relevant state information is the initial value of `n`.

### Conclusion:

Given that the loop will start as long as the condition `n > 4 * steps_taken_in_first_iteration + 2` is satisfied, and since `steps_taken_in_first_iteration` is effectively 0 for the first iteration (as the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed), the condition simplifies to just ensuring `n` is greater than 2.

Therefore, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is simply that `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2**
