`steps` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is 5, the value of `y` is 0, the value of `n` is 0, and the value of `direction_index` is 2. After the code executes, the value of `steps` will be 1 (assuming it was initialized to 0 before this snippet).

Output State: **`x` is 5, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `direction_index` is 2, `steps` is 1**
