Output State: **n is less than steps, x is updated by adding dx * n, y is updated by adding dy * n, _ is 0** 

Explanation: The code block updates the values of `x` and `y` based on the values of `dx` and `dy` from the `directions` list at the index specified by `direction_index`, and multiplies these values by `n`. The variable `_` is not used or modified in the given code, so it remains 0. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `n` is less than `steps` is maintained.
