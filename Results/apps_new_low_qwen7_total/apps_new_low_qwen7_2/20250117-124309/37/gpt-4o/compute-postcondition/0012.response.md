Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than the original value. Steps is decremented by the number of steps taken. Direction_index is updated to the next direction modulo 6. X is incremented by `dx * n` and y is incremented by `dy * n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, then `n` is reduced by `steps`. Otherwise, the function returns `x` incremented by `dx * n` and `y` incremented by `dy * n`.***
