Output State: **dx is the x-component of the direction vector at the new direction_index, dy is the y-component of the direction vector at the new direction_index, x is updated to the new position along the x-axis, y is updated to the new position along the y-axis, direction_index is updated, n is decreased by steps**

Explanation:
1. The first line unpacks the tuple `directions[direction_index]` into `dx` and `dy`.
2. The second line updates `x` by adding `dx * steps` to it.
3. The third line updates `y` by adding `dy * steps` to it.
4. The fourth line decrements `n` by `steps`.
5. The fifth line updates `direction_index` to the next index in the `directions` list using modulo operation to ensure it stays within the bounds (0 to 5).
