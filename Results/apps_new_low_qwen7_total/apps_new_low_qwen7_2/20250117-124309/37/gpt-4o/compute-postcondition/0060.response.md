The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).

- **Case_1:** `x` is updated by adding `dx * n`, `y` is updated by adding `dy * n`, and the program returns the tuple `(x, y)`.

- **Case_2:** `The program returns x which is incremented by dx * n and y which is incremented by dy * n`.

- **Case_3:** The program returns x and y, where x is incremented by dx * n and y is incremented by dy * n, and n is decremented from its value after the first iteration.

- **Case_4:** `x` is x + dx * n and `y` is y + dy * n.

- **Case_5:** The program returns x and y, where x is updated to the new position based on the new direction and n, and y is updated to the new position based on the new direction and n.

- **Case_6:** `x` is updated to the original x plus `dx` multiplied by `n`, `y` is updated to the original y plus `dy` multiplied by `n`.

- **Case_7:** `x` is updated by adding `dx * n` to its original value, `y` is updated by adding `dy * n` to its original value, and the program returns the tuple (`x`, `y`).

- **Case_8:** `x` is 5, `y` is 0.

- **Case_9:** The program returns x that is 6 and y that is 1.

- **Case_10:** The program returns x which is 5 and y which is 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the range \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and based on the specified cases, either update and return the values of `x` and `y`, or return specific values as described.
