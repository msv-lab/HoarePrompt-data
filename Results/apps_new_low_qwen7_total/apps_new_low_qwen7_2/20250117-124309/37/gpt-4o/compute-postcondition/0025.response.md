Initial State: `n` must be greater than 2, and `n` is less than `steps`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `directions` is a list of tuples, `direction_index` is an index within the range of `directions`.

Code Snippet:
```
dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
x += dx * n
y += dy * n
```

Analysis:
1. The first line unpacks the tuple at the `direction_index` in the `directions` list into `dx` and `dy`.
2. The second line updates the value of `x` by adding `dx * n` to it.
3. The third line updates the value of `y` by adding `dy * n` to it.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `directions` and `direction_index`, we can represent them generally. However, after running the code, the updated values of `x` and `y` will depend on the values of `dx`, `dy`, and `n`.

Final Output State: **x is x + dx * n, y is y + dy * n**, `directions` is a list of tuples, `direction_index` is an index within the range of `directions`.
