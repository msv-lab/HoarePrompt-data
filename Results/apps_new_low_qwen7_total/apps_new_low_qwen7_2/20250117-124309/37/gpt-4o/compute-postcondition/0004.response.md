Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the original value, steps is decremented by the number of steps taken, direction_index is updated to the next direction modulo 6, x is incremented by dx * steps, y is incremented by dy * steps, _ is 0** 

Explanation: 
- The first line initializes `dx` and `dy` based on the current `direction_index` from the `directions` list.
- The second and third lines update the coordinates `x` and `y` by moving `steps` units in the direction specified by `dx` and `dy`.
- The fourth line decreases `n` by the value of `steps`.
- The fifth line updates `direction_index` to the next direction in the `directions` list by performing a modulo 6 operation to ensure it stays within the valid range of directions.

Since the exact initial values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `steps`, and `direction_index` are not provided, we can only describe the changes in terms of their relationships and the operations performed on them. The value of `_` remains unchanged and is still 0.
