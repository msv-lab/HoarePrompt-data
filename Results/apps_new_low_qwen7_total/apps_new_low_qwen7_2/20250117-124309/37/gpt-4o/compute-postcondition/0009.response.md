Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the original value - steps, steps is decremented by the number of steps taken, direction_index is updated to the next direction modulo 6, x is incremented by dx * steps, y is incremented by dy * steps, _ is 0**

Explanation:
- The first line unpacks the tuple `directions[direction_index]` into `dx` and `dy`, where `dx` and `dy` represent the change in the x and y coordinates, respectively, based on the current direction.
- The second line updates the x coordinate by adding `dx * steps` to it, effectively moving the point in the direction specified by `dx` and `dy` by the number of steps.
- The third line updates the y coordinate by adding `dy * steps` to it, similarly moving the point in the direction specified by `dx` and `dy`.
- The fourth line decrements `n` by the value of `steps`.
- The fifth line updates `direction_index` to the next direction by performing `(direction_index + 1) % 6`, ensuring that `direction_index` cycles through the range [0, 5].
