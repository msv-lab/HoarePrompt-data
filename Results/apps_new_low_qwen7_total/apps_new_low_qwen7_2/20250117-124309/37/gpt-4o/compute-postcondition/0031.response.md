Postcondition: ***`n` is updated based on the condition. If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, then `dx` is the x-component of the direction vector at the new `direction_index`, `dy` is the y-component of the direction vector at the new `direction_index`, `x` is updated to the new position along the x-axis, `y` is updated to the new position along the y-axis, and `direction_index` is updated. Otherwise, the function returns the updated positions `x` and `y` based on the new direction and `n`.***
