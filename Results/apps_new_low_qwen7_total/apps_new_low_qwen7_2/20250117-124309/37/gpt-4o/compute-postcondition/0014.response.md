Output State: **n is decremented by the number of steps taken in the first iteration, steps is decremented by the number of steps taken in the first iteration, direction_index is updated to the next direction modulo 6, x is incremented by dx * steps, y is incremented by dy * steps**

Explanation:
- The first line `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]` updates `dx` and `dy` based on the current `direction_index`.
- The second line `x += dx * steps` increments `x` by `dx * steps`, where `dx` and `steps` are already known values from the initial state.
- The third line `y += dy * steps` increments `y` by `dy * steps`, similarly using the values of `dy` and `steps` from the initial state.
- The fourth line `n -= steps` decrements `n` by the value of `steps`, which is a value that was decremented in the initial state.

Given that the initial state is such that `n` is decremented from its value after the first iteration, `steps` is decremented by the number of steps taken in the first iteration, `direction_index` is updated to the next direction modulo 6, `x` is incremented by `dx * steps`, and `y` is incremented by `dy * steps`, the final state reflects these changes.
