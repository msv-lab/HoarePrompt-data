The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It updates the coordinates `x` and `y` based on a series of steps and directions, and returns the final coordinates as a tuple `(x, y)`.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Initializes `x` and `y` to 0, `steps` to 1, and `direction_index` to 0.
2. Enters a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 0.
3. Within the loop, it iterates twice:
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, it updates `x` and `y` by adding `dx * steps` and `dy * steps`, respectively, and decrements `n` by `steps`. It then increments `direction_index` and wraps it around using modulo 6.
   - Otherwise, it updates `x` and `y` by adding `dx * n` and `dy * n`, respectively, and exits the loop.
4. After exiting the loop, it increments `steps` by 1.
5. Finally, it returns the updated coordinates `(x, y)`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 0 initially, the function will return `(0, 0)` without performing any updates.
- The loop ensures that `n` is always decremented appropriately, even when the second part of the loop condition is true.
- The function handles large values of `n` up to \(10^{18}\) by incrementing `steps` each time the inner loop completes, ensuring that the updates to `x` and `y` are scaled appropriately.
