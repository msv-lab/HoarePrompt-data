You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Ayrat is looking for the perfect code. He decided to start his search from an infinite field tiled by hexagons. For convenience the coordinate system is introduced, take a look at the picture to see how the coordinates of hexagon are defined: 

[Image] [Image] Ayrat is searching through the field. He started at point (0, 0) and is moving along the spiral (see second picture). Sometimes he forgets where he is now. Help Ayrat determine his location after n moves.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of Ayrat's moves.


-----Output-----

Print two integers x and y — current coordinates of Ayrat coordinates.


-----Examples-----
Input

Output
-2 0

- Program: 
n = int(input().strip())
(x, y) = func_1(n)
print(x, y)

def func_1(n):
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)]
    (x, y) = (0, 0)
    steps = 1
    direction_index = 0
    while n > 0:
        for _ in range(2):
            if n >= steps:
                (dx, dy) = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * steps
                y += dy * steps
                n -= steps
                direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6
            else:
                (dx, dy) = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * n
                y += dy * n
                return (x, y)

    return (x, y)

                x += dx * steps

                x += dx * n
                y += dy * n
                return x, y
        
        steps += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n = 0, direction_index = 2, x = 5, y = 0, steps = 1
    return x, y
    #The program returns x which is 5 and y which is 0



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the movement pattern described. According to the problem, Ayrat moves in a spiral pattern, but the current implementation does not accurately reflect this. Specifically, the logic for moving in each direction for two steps followed by a turn is incorrect. 

For instance, consider the case where `n = 7`. The expected output is `(3, 2)`, but the program returns an incorrect result. Here’s a breakdown:

- After 4 moves, Ayrat should be at `(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1)` (end of first square).
- The next move would be to `(0, 2)`, and then `(1, 2)`.
- After these 6 moves, Ayrat should be at `(1, 2)`, and the 7th move should bring him to `(3, 2)`.

However, the current implementation does not correctly simulate these movements. For `n = 7`, the program incorrectly calculates the position. Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one input case.
