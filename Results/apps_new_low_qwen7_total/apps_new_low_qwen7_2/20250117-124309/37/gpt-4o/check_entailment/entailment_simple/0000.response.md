### Reasoning:

1. **Initial State and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input `n` and initializes the starting coordinates `(x, y)` to `(0, 0)`.
   - It also initializes the step count `steps` to `1` and the direction index to `0`.

2. **Movement Logic:**
   - The logic for movement follows a spiral pattern, where each "side" of the spiral increases by one step at a time.
   - There are 6 directions in the hexagonal grid: right, up-right, up-left, left, down-left, and down-right.
   - The program correctly updates the position `(x, y)` based on the current direction and the number of steps taken.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The main loop runs until `n` becomes zero.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the remaining moves (`n`) are greater than or equal to the current `steps`. If so, it fully completes one side of the current step.
   - Otherwise, it only completes the necessary number of moves for the current side.
   - After completing each side, it increments the `direction_index` to move to the next direction.

4. **Return Statement:**
   - The function correctly returns the final coordinates `(x, y)` when the loop exits.

5. **Edge Case:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when `n` is zero by returning the current coordinates without entering the loop.

Given this analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic for determining Ayrat's position after `n` moves on the hexagonal grid.

### Correctness:
