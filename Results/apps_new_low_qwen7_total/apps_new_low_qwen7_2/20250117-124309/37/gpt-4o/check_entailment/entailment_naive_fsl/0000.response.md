Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the movement pattern described. According to the problem, Ayrat moves in a spiral pattern, but the current implementation does not accurately reflect this. Specifically, the logic for moving in each direction for two steps followed by a turn is incorrect. 

For instance, consider the case where `n = 7`. The expected output is `(3, 2)`, but the program returns an incorrect result. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

- After 4 moves, Ayrat should be at `(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1)` (end of first square).
- The next move would be to `(0, 2)`, and then `(1, 2)`.
- After these 6 moves, Ayrat should be at `(1, 2)`, and the 7th move should bring him to `(3, 2)`.

However, the current implementation does not correctly simulate these movements. For `n = 7`, the program incorrectly calculates the position. Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one input case.
