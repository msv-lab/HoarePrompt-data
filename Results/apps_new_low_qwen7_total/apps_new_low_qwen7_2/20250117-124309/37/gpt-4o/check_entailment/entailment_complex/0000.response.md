Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` correctly simulates Ayrat's movement on the hexagonal grid according to the specified rules. Here are the key points to verify its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `x` and `y` to 0, and sets `steps` to 1. This aligns with starting at the origin (0, 0).
2. **Direction Handling**: The directions are correctly defined, and the function properly cycles through these directions in the required order.
3. **Movement Logic**:
   - The outer `while` loop ensures that all steps are taken until `n` reaches 0.
   - The inner `for` loop runs twice per cycle of directions, updating `x` and `y` accordingly.
   - The logic for updating `x` and `y` ensures that the correct scaling factor (`steps` or `n`) is used based on whether `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is 0 initially, the function correctly returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Large values of `n` up to \(10^{18}\) are handled correctly by incrementing `steps` each time the inner loop completes.
5. **Return Value**: The function returns the final coordinates `(x, y)` after all movements are completed.

Given these points, the function appears to be implemented correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
