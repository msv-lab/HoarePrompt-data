Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Ayrat is looking for the perfect code. He decided to start his search from an infinite field tiled by hexagons. For convenience the coordinate system is introduced, take a look at the picture to see how the coordinates of hexagon are defined: 

[Image] [Image] Ayrat is searching through the field. He started at point (0, 0) and is moving along the spiral (see second picture). Sometimes he forgets where he is now. Help Ayrat determine his location after n moves.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of Ayrat's moves.


-----Output-----

Print two integers x and y — current coordinates of Ayrat coordinates.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
-2 0

Input
7

Output
3 2

# Annotated Program:
n = int(input().strip())
(x, y) = func_1(n)
print(x, y)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^18.
def func_1(n):
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)]

x, y = 0, 0

steps = 1

direction_index = 0
    while n > 0:
        for _ in range(2):
            if n >= steps:
                dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * steps
                y += dy * steps
                n -= steps
                direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6
            else:
                dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * n
                y += dy * n
                return x, y
        
        steps += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n = 0, direction_index = 2, x = 5, y = 0, steps = 1
    return x, y
    #The program returns x which is 5 and y which is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It updates the coordinates `x` and `y` based on a series of steps and directions, and returns the final coordinates as a tuple `(x, y)`.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Initializes `x` and `y` to 0, `steps` to 1, and `direction_index` to 0.
2. Enters a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 0.
3. Within the loop, it iterates twice:
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, it updates `x` and `y` by adding `dx * steps` and `dy * steps`, respectively, and decrements `n` by `steps`. It then increments `direction_index` and wraps it around using modulo 6.
   - Otherwise, it updates `x` and `y` by adding `dx * n` and `dy * n`, respectively, and exits the loop.
4. After exiting the loop, it increments `steps` by 1.
5. Finally, it returns the updated coordinates `(x, y)`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 0 initially, the function will return `(0, 0)` without performing any updates.
- The loop ensures that `n` is always decremented appropriately, even when the second part of the loop condition is true.
- The function handles large values of `n` up to \(10^{18}\) by incrementing `steps` each time the inner loop completes, ensuring that the updates to `x` and `y` are scaled appropriately.
