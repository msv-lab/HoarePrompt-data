Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and function `func_1` step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read as an integer `n`.
   - This integer represents the number of moves Ayrat makes.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes `x` and `y` to 0.
   - Initializes `steps` to 1 and `direction_index` to 0.
   - Uses a while loop to perform moves until `n` becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - Iterates twice for each complete set of steps.
     - Updates `x` and `y` based on the current direction.
     - Decrements `n` appropriately.
     - Changes direction every other step.
   - Increments `steps` by 1 after completing each set of steps.
   - Returns the final coordinates `(x, y)`.

### Function Summary Validation

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function:
- It initializes the starting point and direction.
- It correctly updates the coordinates based on the direction and steps taken.
- It handles the direction change and step increments appropriately.
- It ensures that the total number of moves (`n`) is correctly accounted for.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example given: `n = 7`.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `steps = 1`, `direction_index = 0`.

2. **First Set of Moves (2 steps)**:
   - Direction: `(1, 0)`
   - Moves: `(1, 0) -> (1, 0) + (1, 0) = (2, 0)`
   - Remaining `n = 7 - 2 = 5`
   - Change direction to `(0, 1)`

3. **Second Set of Moves (2 steps)**:
   - Direction: `(0, 1)`
   - Moves: `(2, 0) + (0, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 1) + (0, 1) = (2, 2)`
   - Remaining `n = 5 - 2 = 3`
   - Change direction to `(-1, 1)`

4. **Third Set of Moves (2 steps)**:
   - Direction: `(-1, 1)`
   - Moves: `(2, 2) + (-1, 1) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 3) + (-1, 1) = (0, 4)`
   - Remaining `n = 3 - 2 = 1`
   - Change direction to `(-1, 0)`

5. **Final Move (1 step)**:
   - Direction: `(-1, 0)`
   - Moves: `(0, 4) + (-1, 0) = (-1, 4)`
   - Remaining `n = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - Return coordinates: `(-1, 4)`

This analysis shows that the function does not correctly simulate the spiral movement pattern for `n = 7`. The expected output is `(3, 2)`, but the function returns `(-1, 4)`. This indicates that the function does not correctly implement the spiral pattern as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The function does not correctly simulate the spiral movement pattern, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

Final: **False**
