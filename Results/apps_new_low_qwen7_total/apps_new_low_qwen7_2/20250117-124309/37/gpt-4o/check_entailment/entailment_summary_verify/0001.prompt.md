You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Ayrat is looking for the perfect code. He decided to start his search from an infinite field tiled by hexagons. For convenience the coordinate system is introduced, take a look at the picture to see how the coordinates of hexagon are defined: 

[Image] [Image] Ayrat is searching through the field. He started at point (0, 0) and is moving along the spiral (see second picture). Sometimes he forgets where he is now. Help Ayrat determine his location after n moves.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of Ayrat's moves.


-----Output-----

Print two integers x and y — current coordinates of Ayrat coordinates.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
-2 0

Input
7

Output
3 2

- Program:
n = int(input().strip())
(x, y) = func_1(n)
print(x, y)

def func_1(n):
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)]
    (x, y) = (0, 0)
    steps = 1
    direction_index = 0
    while n > 0:
        for _ in range(2):
            if n >= steps:
                (dx, dy) = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * steps
                y += dy * steps
                n -= steps
                direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6
            else:
                (dx, dy) = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * n
                y += dy * n
                return (x, y)
        steps += 1
    return (x, y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It updates the coordinates `x` and `y` based on a series of steps and directions, and returns the final coordinates as a tuple `(x, y)`.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Initializes `x` and `y` to 0, `steps` to 1, and `direction_index` to 0.
2. Enters a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 0.
3. Within the loop, it iterates twice:
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, it updates `x` and `y` by adding `dx * steps` and `dy * steps`, respectively, and decrements `n` by `steps`. It then increments `direction_index` and wraps it around using modulo 6.
   - Otherwise, it updates `x` and `y` by adding `dx * n` and `dy * n`, respectively, and exits the loop.
4. After exiting the loop, it increments `steps` by 1.
5. Finally, it returns the updated coordinates `(x, y)`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 0 initially, the function will return `(0, 0)` without performing any updates.
- The loop ensures that `n` is always decremented appropriately, even when the second part of the loop condition is true.
- The function handles large values of `n` up to \(10^{18}\) by incrementing `steps` each time the inner loop completes, ensuring that the updates to `x` and `y` are scaled appropriately.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the logic of Ayrat's movement on the hexagonal grid.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of moves Ayrat makes.
2. **Movement Logic**:
   - Directions are defined for the six possible moves on the hexagonal grid.
   - The variables `(x, y)` represent Ayrat's current position.
   - `steps` keeps track of the number of steps taken in each direction.
   - `direction_index` keeps track of the current direction.
   - The `while` loop runs until `n` moves are completed.
   - Inside the loop, there is a nested `for` loop that processes two segments of the spiral:
     - The first segment (`if n >= steps:`) increments `n` and updates the position with `steps` steps in the current direction.
     - The second segment (`else:`) handles the remaining steps if `n < steps`.
   - After completing the first segment, the direction index is updated to the next direction.
   - The steps are incremented after each segment of the spiral.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is zero, the initial position `(0, 0)` should be returned, which is handled by the function.
   - The logic for handling the nested `for` loops seems correct as it ensures the spiral pattern is followed accurately.

4. **Output**: The function returns the final position `(x, y)` after `n` moves.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly simulates Ayrat's movement on the hexagonal grid according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine Ayrat's position after `n` moves.
