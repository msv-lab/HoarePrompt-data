The function processes two integers, \(n\) and \(a\), where \(1 \leq a \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n\) is even. It prints a value based on the relationship between \(a\) and \(n\). Specifically, if \(a \leq \frac{n}{2}\), it prints either \(a // 2\) if \(a\) is even, or \(a // 2 + 1\) if \(a\) is odd. If \(a > \frac{n}{2}\), it prints \(0\). The function does not return a value but modifies the output stream by printing the calculated value. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the code that need to be handled separately, but the code correctly handles the boundary condition where \(a = \frac{n}{2}\) by ensuring the correct value is printed based on whether \(a\) is even or odd.
