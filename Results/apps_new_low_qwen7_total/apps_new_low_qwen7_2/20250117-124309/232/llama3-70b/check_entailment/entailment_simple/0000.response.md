### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum time for Vasya to reach house `a` on a street with `n` houses.
   - Houses are numbered from 1 to `n-1` on one side and from `2` to `n` on the other side.
   - The time to travel from the start to house 1 or `n` is 1 second, and the time to travel between adjacent houses is 1 second.
   - We need to handle both cases where `a` is less than or equal to `n/2` and where `a` is greater than `n/2`.

2. **Analysis of the Provided Code:**
   - The code correctly reads `n` and `a` from input.
   - It checks whether `a` is less than or equal to `n/2`.
     - If true, the time to reach `a` is calculated as `a // 2 + a % 2`. This formula accounts for the initial 1-second trip to either side and the subsequent time to travel the required number of houses.
     - If false, the time to reach `a` is calculated as `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`. This formula accounts for the fact that `a` is on the opposite side, requiring an additional second to cross the middle point.

3. **Verification of Correctness:**
   - For `a <= n/2`, the formula `a // 2 + a % 2` correctly calculates the minimum time. This is because:
     - If `a` is even, `a // 2` gives the number of steps divided by 2, and `a % 2` ensures the exact number of steps.
     - If `a` is odd, `a // 2` gives the number of steps minus 1, and `a % 2` ensures the exact number of steps.
   - For `a > n/2`, the formula `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2` correctly calculates the minimum time. This is because:
     - The distance to the corresponding house on the other side is `n - a + 1`, which is effectively the distance from the middle point.
     - The formula ensures the exact number of steps including the initial 1-second trip across the middle.

Given this analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic for calculating the minimum time for Vasya to reach house `a`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
