The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints, it seems the function might internally use or rely on the values of `n` and `a`, where `n` and `a` are integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n \leq 100,000\) and `n` is even. 

Given the output cases, the function will return different values based on the relationship between `a` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but relies on the values of `n` and `a` where \(1 \leq a \leq n \leq 100,000\) and `n` is even, and returns a value based on the relationship between `a` and `n`.**
