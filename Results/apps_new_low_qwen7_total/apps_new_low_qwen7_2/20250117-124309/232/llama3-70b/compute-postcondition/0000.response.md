The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `a` respectively. The initial conditions are that `1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100, 000` and `n` is even. After the code runs, the values of `n` and `a` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`n` and `a` are integers such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100, 000` and `n` is even, where the specific values of `n` and `a` are determined by the input.**
