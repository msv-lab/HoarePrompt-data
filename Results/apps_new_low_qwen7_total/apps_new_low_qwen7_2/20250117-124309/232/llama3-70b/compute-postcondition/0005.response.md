Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, and `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n \leq 100,000\). If \(a \leq \frac{n}{2}\), the printed value is either `a // 2` if `a` is even or `a // 2 + 1` if `a` is odd. If \(a > \frac{n}{2}\), the printed value is 0.***
