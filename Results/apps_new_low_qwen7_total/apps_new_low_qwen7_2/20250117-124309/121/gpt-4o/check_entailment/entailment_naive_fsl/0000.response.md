Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the count of some nucleotides is already more than the target count. For example, consider the input:

```
8
AGGCCCC?
```

In this case, the initial counts are:
- A: 1
- C: 7
- G: 1
- T: 0

The target count for each nucleotide is 2. However, the program will attempt to replace the question mark with 'T' (since 'T' has the lowest count), which will make the counts:
- A: 1
- C: 7
- G: 1
- T: 1

This results in the count of 'C' being 7, which is more than the target count of 2. The program does not check if replacing a question mark will lead to any count exceeding the target count, hence it may produce an invalid output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
