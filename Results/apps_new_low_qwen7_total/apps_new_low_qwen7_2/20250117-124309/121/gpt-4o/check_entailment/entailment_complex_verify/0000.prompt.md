You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 6, `n` is 6, `result` is ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T', 'A', 'C'], and `counts` is {'A': 2, 'C': 2, 'G': 1, 'T': 0}.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes an input consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The function checks if `n` is divisible by 4 and if the count of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` does not exceed `n/4`. If these conditions are met, it replaces the '?' characters in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each character appears exactly `n/4` times in the resulting string. If any of these conditions fail, the function prints '===' and returns. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the count of some nucleotides is already more than the target count. For example, consider the input:

```
8
AGGCCCC?
```

In this case, the initial counts are:
- A: 1
- C: 7
- G: 1
- T: 0

The target count for each nucleotide is 2. However, the program will attempt to replace the question mark with 'T' (since 'T' has the lowest count), which will make the counts:
- A: 1
- C: 7
- G: 1
- T: 1

This results in the count of 'C' being 7, which is more than the target count of 2. The program does not check if replacing a question mark will lead to any count exceeding the target count, hence it may produce an invalid output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
