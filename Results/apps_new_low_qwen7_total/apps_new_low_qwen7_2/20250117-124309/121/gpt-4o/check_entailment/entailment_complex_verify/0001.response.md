### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input correctly by using `sys.stdin.read` and then splitting the input into `n` and `s`. This is correct.

2. **Checking Divisibility:**
   - The program checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints "===" and returns. This is correct because if `n` is not divisible by 4, it's impossible to have an equal number of each nucleotide.

3. **Calculating Target Count:**
   - The program calculates the target count as `target_count = n // 4`. This is correct.

4. **Counting Nucleotides:**
   - The program initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. It iterates through the string `s` and updates the count for each nucleotide. This is correct.

5. **Checking Excess Nucleotides:**
   - The program checks if any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count. If so, it prints "===" and returns. This is correct because having more than the target count for any nucleotide would make it impossible to have an equal number of each nucleotide.

6. **Decoding Unrecognized Nucleotides:**
   - The program initializes a list from the string `s` to allow in-place modifications. It then iterates through each character in `s`, and if it encounters a '?', it replaces it with a nucleotide that has not yet reached its target count. It breaks out of the inner loop once a suitable nucleotide is chosen to avoid redundant replacements. This is correct.

7. **Ensuring Equal Distribution:**
   - After replacing all '?', the program ensures that each nucleotide's count matches the target count. Since the program only replaces '?' with nucleotides that haven't reached their target count, it guarantees that each nucleotide will end up with the correct count.

8. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program joins the list back into a string and prints it. This is correct.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the genome can be decoded if it is possible. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
