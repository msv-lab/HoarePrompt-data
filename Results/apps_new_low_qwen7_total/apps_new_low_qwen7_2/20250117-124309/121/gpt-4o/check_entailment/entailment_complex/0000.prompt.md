Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string s of length n representing the coded genome, which consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

n = int(data[0])

s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is 6, s is ACGT??? and (n % 4 == 0)
    target_count = n // 4

counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n = 6, s = "ACGT???", counts = {'A': 1, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 0}
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n = 6, s = "ACGT???", counts = {'A': 1, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 0}
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 6, `n` is 6, `result` is ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T', 'A', 'C'], and `counts` is {'A': 2, 'C': 2, 'G': 1, 'T': 0}.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes an input consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The function checks if `n` is divisible by 4 and if the count of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` does not exceed `n/4`. If these conditions are met, it replaces the '?' characters in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each character appears exactly `n/4` times in the resulting string. If any of these conditions fail, the function prints '===' and returns. The function does not return any value.
