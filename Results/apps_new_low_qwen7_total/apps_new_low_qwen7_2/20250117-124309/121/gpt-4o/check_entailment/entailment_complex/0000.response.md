Reasoning:
- The function reads the input values from stdin and splits them into `n` and `s`.
- It checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns, indicating that the genome cannot be evenly divided into four parts of equal size.
- It then initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string `s`.
- The function iterates through `s` and updates the counts for the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
- Next, it checks if any of these counts exceeds `target_count` (which is `n // 4`). If so, it prints '===' and returns, indicating that it's not possible to have an equal number of each type of nucleotide.
- If both checks pass, the function proceeds to replace the '?' characters in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each character appears exactly `target_count` times. This is done by iterating over the characters in `s` and updating the `counts` dictionary whenever a '?' is replaced.
- Finally, it prints the modified string `result`.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the function correctly handles the input and produces the expected output according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
