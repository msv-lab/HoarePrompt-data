### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Validation:**
   - The program correctly reads the input from standard input and splits it into `n` and `s`.
   - It checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints `===`, indicating it's impossible to have an equal number of each nucleotide type.

2. **Count Calculation:**
   - It calculates the target count (`target_count = n // 4`) which is the required number of each nucleotide type.

3. **Character Counting:**
   - It counts the occurrences of each valid nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the string `s`.

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   - It checks if the current counts of any nucleotide exceed the target count. If so, it prints `===`, indicating it's impossible to decode correctly.

5. **Decoding Process:**
   - If the feasibility check passes, it iterates over the string `s` and replaces each '?' with the least frequent nucleotide to ensure all nucleotides are equally represented.

6. **Output Generation:**
   - After decoding, it joins the list `result` back into a string and prints it.

Given the steps above, the program correctly handles all cases:
- It checks for the possibility of decoding.
- It ensures that if decoding is possible, it will do so by replacing '?' with the appropriate nucleotides to balance the counts.

### Correctness:

**True**

The annotated program logic matches the problem requirements and handles all necessary edge cases.
