Reasoning:

1. The program reads the input correctly, splitting the input into `n` and `s`.
2. It checks if the length of the genome `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints "===" and returns immediately, which is correct.
3. It calculates the target count for each type of nucleotide (`target_count = n // 4`).
4. It initializes a dictionary to count occurrences of each nucleotide (`counts`).
5. It iterates through the string `s` and updates the count of each nucleotide if it exists in the dictionary.
6. It checks if any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count. If so, it prints "===" and returns immediately, which is correct.
7. If the previous checks pass, it proceeds to decode the unrecognized nucleotides:
   - It initializes a list from the string `s` to allow in-place modifications.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`, and if it encounters a '?', it replaces it with a nucleotide that has not yet reached its target count. It breaks out of the inner loop once a suitable nucleotide is chosen to avoid redundant replacements.
8. Finally, it joins the list back into a string and prints it.

Given the logic and the steps taken by the function, the program correctly decodes the genome if it's possible and handles the cases where it's not possible by printing "===".

Correctness: **True**
