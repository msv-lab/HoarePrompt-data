You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes an input consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The function checks if `n` is divisible by 4 and if the count of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` does not exceed `n/4`. If these conditions are met, it replaces the '?' characters in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each character appears exactly `n/4` times in the resulting string. If any of these conditions fail, the function prints '===' and returns. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program reads the input correctly, splitting the input into `n` and `s`.
2. It checks if the length of the genome `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints "===" and returns immediately, which is correct.
3. It calculates the target count for each type of nucleotide (`target_count = n // 4`).
4. It initializes a dictionary to count occurrences of each nucleotide (`counts`).
5. It iterates through the string `s` and updates the count of each nucleotide if it exists in the dictionary.
6. It checks if any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count. If so, it prints "===" and returns immediately, which is correct.
7. If the previous checks pass, it proceeds to decode the unrecognized nucleotides:
   - It initializes a list from the string `s` to allow in-place modifications.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`, and if it encounters a '?', it replaces it with a nucleotide that has not yet reached its target count. It breaks out of the inner loop once a suitable nucleotide is chosen to avoid redundant replacements.
8. Finally, it joins the list back into a string and prints it.

Given the logic and the steps taken by the function, the program correctly decodes the genome if it's possible and handles the cases where it's not possible by printing "===".
