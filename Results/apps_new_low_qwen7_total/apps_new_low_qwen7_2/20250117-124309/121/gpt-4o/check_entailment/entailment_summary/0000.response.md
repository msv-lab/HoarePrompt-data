Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the input, splitting it into an array, and extracting `n` and `s`.
2. It checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns, which handles one of the required conditions.
3. It calculates the target count of each nucleotide (`target_count = n // 4`).
4. It counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string `s`.
5. It checks if any of these counts exceed the target count. If so, it prints '===' and returns, handling another required condition.
6. If both conditions are satisfied, it proceeds to replace the '?' characters with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each character appears exactly `n/4` times.
7. The replacement logic ensures that the first available character from ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'] is chosen for each '?' if the count of that character is less than `target_count`.

Given this detailed breakdown, the program follows the requirements correctly and addresses all edge cases (like checking divisibility by 4 and ensuring no overcounting).

Correctness: **True**
