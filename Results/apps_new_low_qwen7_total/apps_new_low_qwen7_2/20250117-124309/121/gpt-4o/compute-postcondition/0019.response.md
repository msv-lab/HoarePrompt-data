The code `print('===')` does not affect any variables or their values. It only prints the string '===' to the console. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is 6, `s` is "ACGT???", `counts` is {'A': 1, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 0}, `char` is one of the keys in `counts`. The current value of `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`. The string '===' is printed to the console.**
