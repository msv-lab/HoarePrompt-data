Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes an input consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The function checks if `n` is divisible by 4 and if the count of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` does not exceed `n/4`. If these conditions are met, it replaces the '?' characters in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each character appears exactly `n/4` times in the resulting string. If any of these conditions fail, the function prints '===' and returns. The function does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n % 4 != 0`, the function prints '===' and returns without further processing.
- If the count of any character ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') exceeds `n/4`, the function prints '===' and returns.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where the string `s` contains more than one '?' character that needs to be replaced. It only ensures that each character ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') appears exactly `n/4` times, but does not specify which '?' should be replaced with which character. This could lead to different valid outputs depending on the order in which '?' characters are replaced.
