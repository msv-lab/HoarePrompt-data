The code `print('===')` simply prints the string '===' to the console. It does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `s`, `counts`, or `char`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is 6, `s` is "ACGT???", `counts` is {'A': 2, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 1}, and `char` is one of the remaining keys in the `counts` dictionary.**
