The provided code snippet consists of three lines, but it seems incomplete because the code ends abruptly without the necessary context or the full definition of the variables `result`, `counts`, `char`, and `target_count`. However, based on the available lines and the initial state, we can make some assumptions to deduce the final state.

Given Initial State:
- `i` is 7
- `n` is 6
- `counts[char]` is incremented by 1 if it was less than `target_count` and `char` is the first key in the `counts` dictionary that causes this condition to be true (this implies that `char` is the first key in `counts` that, when its count is incremented, meets the condition)

Let's assume:
- `result` is a list or a dictionary where `result[i]` is being assigned a value.
- `counts` is a dictionary where keys are characters and values are their counts.
- `char` is the first key in `counts` that, when its count is incremented, meets the condition of being less than `target_count`.

The first line:
```python
result[i] = char
```
Assigns `char` to `result[7]`.

The second line:
```python
counts[char] += 1
```
Increments the count of `char` in the `counts` dictionary by 1.

The third line:
```python
break
```
This line is used to exit a loop, but since there is no loop context provided, we will assume this line is part of a loop that would have been defined elsewhere.

Since `i` and `n` are not affected by these lines, they remain unchanged. We need to determine the final state of `char` and `counts`.

Final Output State:
- `i` is 7
- `n` is 6
- `result[7]` is `char`
- `counts[char]` is incremented by 1

However, without the exact initial state of `counts` and `target_count`, we cannot specify the exact value of `char` or `counts[char]`. We know that `char` is the first key in `counts` that, when its count is incremented, meets the condition of being less than `target_count`.

Therefore, the final output state can be described as:
Output State: **i is 7, n is 6, result[7] is char, counts[char] is incremented by 1**
