Postcondition: ***`i` is 6, `n` is 6, and `result` is a list of 6 elements. If `result[i]` is set to a character `char` (initially the first character in `counts` satisfying `counts[char] < target_count`), then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1. If no such `char` exists, `result[i]` remains unchanged.***
