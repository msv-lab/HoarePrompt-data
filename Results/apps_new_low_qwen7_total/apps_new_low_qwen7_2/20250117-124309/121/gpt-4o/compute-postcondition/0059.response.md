The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 6 and `n` is 6.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is 6, `i` must be incremented to 7 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 7, `n` is 6**
