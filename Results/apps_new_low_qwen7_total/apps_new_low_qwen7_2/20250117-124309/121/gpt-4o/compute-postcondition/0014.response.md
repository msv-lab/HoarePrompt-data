The code `counts[char] += 1` increments the count of the character `char` in the dictionary `counts`. Since `char` is 'G' and `n` is 6, `s` is "ACGT???", the initial state of `counts` is not given, so we assume it starts as an empty dictionary.

- Initially, `counts` is an empty dictionary.
- `char` is 'G'.

After executing `counts[char] += 1`, the dictionary `counts` will have an entry for 'G' with a count of 1.

Output State: **`n` is 6, `s` is "ACGT???", `counts` is {'G': 1}**
