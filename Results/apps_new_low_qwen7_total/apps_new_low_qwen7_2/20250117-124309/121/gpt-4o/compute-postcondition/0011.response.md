The code `counts[char] += 1` updates the count of the character `char` in the dictionary `counts`. Given that `char` is 'C', the value of `counts['C']` will be incremented by 1. Since `counts` was not initialized before this line, it will be created as a dictionary and the key 'C' will be added with a value of 1. The initial state values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 6, `s` is "ACGT???", `counts` is {'C': 1}, `char` is 'C'**
