Postcondition: ***`n` is 6, `s` is "ACGT???", `counts` is a dictionary where the total count of characters A, C, G, and T remains consistent with the initial state. If the count of `char` in `counts` is greater than `target_count`, the program does not return any value. Otherwise, the program also does not return any value.***
