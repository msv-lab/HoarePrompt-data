Postcondition: ***`i` is 6, `n` is 6, `result` is a list of 6 elements. If there exists at least one character `char` such that `counts[char] < target_count`, the i-th element of `result` is set to `char` and `counts[char]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
