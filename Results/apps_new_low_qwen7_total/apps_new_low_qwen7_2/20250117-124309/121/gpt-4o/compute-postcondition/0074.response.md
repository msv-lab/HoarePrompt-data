The function `func_1` does not accept any input parameters. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` representing the coded genome, which consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

The function has multiple cases where it does not return any value:
- Case_1: The program returns `None`.
- Case_2: None
- Case_3: None
- Case_4: The program does not return any value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the input consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` without returning any value.
