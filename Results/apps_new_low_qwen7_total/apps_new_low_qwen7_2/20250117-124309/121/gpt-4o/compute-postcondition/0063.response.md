Postcondition: ***`i` is 7, `n` is 6, `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, and `result[i]` contains `char`. If `counts[char]` was less than `target_count`, these changes occur. No changes occur if `counts[char]` is not less than `target_count` since there is no else part that alters the state of the program variables.***
