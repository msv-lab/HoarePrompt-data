The code `print('===')` simply prints the string '===' to the console. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `s`, `counts`, and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 6, `s` is "ACGT???", `counts` is {'A': 2, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 1}, `char` is 'A' (or 'C' or 'G')**
