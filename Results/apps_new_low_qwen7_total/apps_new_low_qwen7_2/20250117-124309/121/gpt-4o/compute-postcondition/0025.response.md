Postcondition: ***`n` is 6, `s` is "ACGT???", `counts` is {'A': 2, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 1}, and `char` is 'A' (or 'C' or 'G'). If the count of `char` in `counts` is greater than `target_count`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
