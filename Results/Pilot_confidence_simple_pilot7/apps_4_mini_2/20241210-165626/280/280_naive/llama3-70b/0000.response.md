To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step.

The problem requires calculating the maximum possible length of a path section given the initial speed \( v_1 \), final speed \( v_2 \), time \( t \), and maximum speed change \( d \) per second.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program reads the initial speeds \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \), and the parameters \( t \) and \( d \).
2. It initializes the `max_speed` to the maximum of \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) and `min_speed` to the minimum.
3. It calculates the initial `max_length` based on `max_speed` and `min_length` based on `min_speed`, both multiplied by \( t \).
4. A loop runs from \( t - 1 \) to \( 1 \), adjusting `max_speed` and `min_speed` by \( d \) and accumulating their values to `max_length` and `min_length`.
5. Finally, it prints `max_length`.

### Potential Issues:
1. The loop iterates backward from \( t - 1 \) to \( 1 \). This means it is adjusting speeds but does not consider all potential speed configurations that could maximize the distance.
2. The logic of updating `max_speed` and `min_speed` may not always yield the correct maximum distance due to the constraints of speed changes.
3. The program does not account for the scenario where \( d = 0 \) properly in terms of ensuring that the speeds remain constant throughout the duration.

### Example Case to Test:
Let's consider the case where:
- \( v_1 = 1 \)
- \( v_2 = 1 \)
- \( t = 3 \)
- \( d = 0 \)

According to the problem, since \( d = 0 \), the speed must remain constant at \( v = 1 \) throughout the 3 seconds. The expected output should be \( 1 \times 3 = 3 \).

However, the program initializes `max_speed` and `min_speed` both to \( 1 \), calculates `max_length` as \( 1 \times 3 = 3 \), but then enters the loop. Since \( d = 0 \), the loop should not alter the speeds, but the logic may not handle this correctly in terms of maintaining the constant speed.

### Conclusion:
Given that there is a potential case where the program could fail to maintain the correct speed configuration and thus produce an incorrect maximum length, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
