To analyze the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the functionality of the program and identify potential edge cases that it may not handle correctly.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to determine if we can transform matrix `B` (initialized to all zeros) into matrix `A` using a series of operations that set a `2x2` submatrix of `B` to `1`. The operation can only be performed if:
1. The top-left corner of the `2x2` submatrix is chosen such that it does not exceed the bounds of the matrix.
2. The goal is to make `B` equal to `A` entirely, meaning every `1` and `0` in `A` must match with `B`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program does the following:
1. Reads the dimensions of the matrix and the matrix `A`.
2. Initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations.
3. Iterates through all possible `2x2` submatrices in `A` (from `(0,0)` to `(n-2, m-2)`).
4. If the current `2x2` submatrix can be fully filled with `1`s in `A`, it skips to the next submatrix.
5. If any of the four positions in the `2x2` submatrix contains a `1`, it appends the operation to `ops`.
6. Finally, it checks if the number of operations exceeds `2500` and prints the result.

### Potential Issues
1. **Incorrect Handling of Zeroes**: The program does not ensure that all `1`s in `A` can be covered by the operations. For example, if `A` has isolated `1`s that cannot form a `2x2` block, the program will incorrectly append operations that don't actually help in achieving the goal.
2. **Output of `-1`**: The program only checks if the length of `ops` exceeds `2500` to print `-1`, but it does not check if `B` can actually be made to equal `A`. Thus, it may return a valid number of operations even when it is impossible to achieve the desired transformation.

### Example Case Where Program Fails
Consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
In this case, the `1`s in the first two columns cannot form a `2x2` block due to the `0`s in the second column. The program would append operations for the isolated `1`s, but it is impossible to achieve matrix `A` from `B` using valid operations.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine whether matrix `B` can be transformed into matrix `A` under the specified operations. It fails in cases where `1`s are isolated or cannot form a `2x2` block.

Correctness: **False**.
