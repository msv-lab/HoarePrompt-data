Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it fails to account for the minimum number of stones that must be present at the start in order to perform the operations successfully.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
----- 
```
In this case, Vasya is trying to take 5 stones from the pile. If he starts with 0 stones, he cannot perform the first operation, which violates the problem's constraint that the pile must be non-empty before each operation of taking a stone. The correct output for this case should be 0, assuming he starts with at least 5 stones.

However, the program logic simply checks if the number of "-" operations exceeds the number of "+" operations and prints 0 if it does, which is incorrect because it does not consider the necessity of starting with enough stones to perform all take operations.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
