To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and consider various edge cases.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The teacher asks questions in a zig-zag manner across the rows.
2. Each row has `m` pupils, and there are `n` rows.
3. The teacher asks `k` questions in total.
4. We need to determine:
   - The maximum number of questions any pupil is asked.
   - The minimum number of questions any pupil is asked.
   - How many times Sergei is asked.

### Analyzing the Program:
The program calculates the following:
- `max_asked`: The maximum number of questions asked to any pupil.
- `min_asked`: The minimum number of questions asked to any pupil.
- `sergei_asked`: The number of times Sergei is asked.

#### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Maximum Questions**:
   - The formula `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)` seems to calculate how many full cycles of asking have been completed. Each full cycle consists of asking all pupils from the first to the last row and then back to the first row.
   
2. **Minimum Questions**:
   - The calculation `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))` attempts to set a lower bound of 1 for the minimum questions, but it may not accurately reflect the distribution of questions among pupils, especially for edge cases where `k` is small relative to `n` and `m`.

3. **Sergei's Questions**:
   - The calculation for `sergei_asked` looks to determine how many times Sergei has been asked based on the total questions and his position.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Single Row**: If `n = 1`, all pupils will be asked the same number of times, which should be `k // m` (plus one if there's a remainder).
2. **Small `k`**: If `k` is less than `m`, then only the first few pupils in the first row will be asked, which should be handled correctly.
3. **Large `k`**: When `k` is very large (close to `10^18`), we need to ensure that the calculations for maximum and minimum questions remain valid.
4. **Sergei's Position**: If Sergei is in the first or last position, the logic should correctly account for how many times he is asked compared to other pupils.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider an edge case:
- **Input**: `1 3 2 1 1` (1 row, 3 pupils, 2 questions, Sergei is at position 1)
  - Expected Output: `1 1 1` (since there is only one row, each pupil can only be asked once, and Sergei will be asked once).

Running this through the program:
- `max_asked` would be `(2 + (1 - 1)) // (2 * 1) = 1`
- `min_asked` would be `max(1, 1 - (1 - 1)) = 1`
- `sergei_asked` would be `(2 + 1 - 1) // (2 * 1) + ((2 + 1 - 1) % (2 * 1) >= 1 - 1 + 1) = 1 + 1 = 2`

The output would be `1 1 2`, which is incorrect for the case where `k` is less than `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the edge case where `k` is less than `m` correctly, leading to an incorrect output for that scenario. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
