To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code and verify if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The problem asks for three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
1. \(0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n\)
2. \(0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m\)
3. The area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Initial Check**:
   ```python
   if n * m % k:
       print('NO')
       exit()
   ```
   This checks if \(n \cdot m\) is divisible by \(k\). If not, it immediately prints "NO". This is correct because if the area must be a whole number, \(nm/k\) must also be an integer.

2. **Function Call**:
   ```python
   (n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
   ```
   This function seems to be calculating some values based on \(n\) and \(m\). The function `func_3` uses `func_2`, which implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = gcd(a, b)\). 

3. **Area Check**:
   ```python
   if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
   ```
   Here, it checks if the absolute value of \(n1 \cdot m\) is greater than or equal to \(g\). This is not the correct condition for the area of the triangle formed by the points. The area of the triangle formed by three points is calculated using the determinant method, and it should be directly related to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

4. **Output Points**:
   The output points are:
   ```python
   print(0, 0)
   print(0, n1 * m // g)
   print(m1 * m // g, 0)
   ```
   These points do not guarantee that they will always form a triangle with the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) as specified. The selection of points does not take into account the requirement that the area needs to match \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

### Example of Failure Case

Consider the case where:
- \(n = 4\)
- \(m = 4\)
- \(k = 7\)

According to the problem, the area required is \(\frac{4 \cdot 4}{7} = \frac{16}{7}\), which is not an integer. The program will output "NO" correctly. However, if we test with \(n = 4\), \(m = 4\), and \(k = 2\), the area required is \(\frac{16}{2} = 8\). The program may not return valid points for all cases, especially those where the area cannot be achieved with integer coordinates.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to ensure that the area of the triangle formed by the output points matches \(\frac{nm}{k}\) for all valid inputs. Therefore, there are indeed cases where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
