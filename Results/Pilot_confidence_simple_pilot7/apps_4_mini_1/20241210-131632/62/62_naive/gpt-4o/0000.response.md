To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the implementation step by step.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of digits and the base for both numbers X and Y correctly.
2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `func_1` correctly converts a number from its base representation to decimal. It uses the formula:
   \[
   \text{decimal\_value} = \text{decimal\_value} \times \text{base} + \text{digit}
   \]
   This is the standard method for converting a number from base `b` to decimal.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them and prints the appropriate symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison.

Now, let's consider edge cases:

- **Minimum Input Values**: If we test with the smallest values:
  ```
  Input:
  1 2
  1
  1 3
  1
  ```
  Here, X is 1 in base 2 (which is 1 in decimal), and Y is also 1 in base 3 (which is 1 in decimal). The output should be `=`. The program handles this correctly.

- **Different Lengths**: Consider a case where X has more digits than Y:
  ```
  Input:
  2 2
  1 0
  1 3
  2
  ```
  Here, X is 2 (10 in binary) and Y is 2 (2 in decimal). The output should be `>`. The program handles this correctly.

- **Leading Zeroes**: The problem states there will be no leading zeroes. However, it does not specify what happens if a leading zero is provided in the input, though it should not happen according to the problem. The program does not check for this, but since the input guarantees no leading zeroes, this is not an issue.

- **Maximum Values**: Testing with the maximum allowed values:
  ```
  Input:
  10 40
  39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39
  10 39
  38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38
  ```
  In this case, X is calculated correctly and is greater than Y. The output should be `>`. The program handles this correctly.

After considering these cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles the expected edge cases. 

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal and compares them as required by the problem description.
