Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly determines whether the records can be consistent based solely on the total number of stones in the piles. The logic only checks if the total number of stones in the second visit (`total_y`) is greater than that in the first visit (`total_x`). However, it does not account for the possibility that stones can be moved between piles.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
5 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0 0
```

In this case, the total number of stones remains the same (`total_x = 5` and `total_y = 5`), but the distribution of stones changes significantly. The program would output "Yes" (since `total_y` is not greater than `total_x`), but it is impossible to achieve the second configuration from the first configuration with the described operations (taking stones or moving them). 

Thus, the program fails to handle this case, making it incorrect.
