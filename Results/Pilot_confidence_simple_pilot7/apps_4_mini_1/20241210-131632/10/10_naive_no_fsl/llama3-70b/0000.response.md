To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code against the problem description and identify any potential cases where the program may not function as expected.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of sofas, the dimensions of the storehouse, the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts of sofas in the specified directions (left, right, top, bottom).
  
2. **Sofa Representation**: Each sofa is represented by its two coordinates, which are stored in a list. This is correct as per the problem requirements.

3. **Counting Logic**: The function `func_1` counts how many sofas are to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. The conditions check if the sofas are aligned either horizontally or vertically, which is correct.

4. **Output Logic**: The program iterates through each sofa, calls `func_1` to get the counts, and compares them with the provided counts. If a match is found, it prints the index of that sofa. If no match is found after checking all sofas, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Edge Cases
- **Sofa Coordinates**: The program does not check if the coordinates are valid ranges within the dimensions of the storehouse. For instance, if a sofa has coordinates that exceed `n` or `m`, it could lead to incorrect behavior.
  
- **Sofa Overlap**: The problem guarantees that no two sofas occupy the same cell, but the program does not explicitly handle any potential overlaps or misalignments that could occur if input data were incorrectly formatted.

- **Sofa Alignment**: The counting logic in `func_1` is based on the assumption that the sofas are aligned in a specific manner. If the input does not adhere to this, the counts may be incorrect. For example, if two sofas are diagonal to each other, the program may incorrectly count them as being aligned.

### Example of Failure
Let's consider an edge case:
- Input:
```
2
2 2
1 1 1 2
2 1 2 2
1 1 1 1
```
- Explanation: Here, both sofas are adjacent, but the counts for the specified conditions (left, right, top, bottom) may not match correctly due to the counting logic not accounting for the actual positions of the sofas correctly.

### Conclusion
Given the potential edge cases identified, particularly with the handling of the sofa coordinates and alignment checks, the program may not always produce the correct output as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
