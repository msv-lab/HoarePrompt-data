Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). 

The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of divisors of \( n \) instead of counting the different weights of splits. The weights of splits are determined by how many times the first element appears in the split, which is not related to the number of divisors of \( n \).

For example, if we take \( n = 8 \), the splits and their weights are:
- Weight 1: [8]
- Weight 2: [4, 4]
- Weight 3: [3, 3, 2]
- Weight 4: [2, 2, 2, 2]
- Weight 5: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]
- Weight 6: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

The correct output for \( n = 8 \) is 5, as there are 5 different weights (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). However, the program incorrectly counts divisors instead of weights, leading to incorrect results.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, making it incorrect.
