To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze what the program is doing and how it relates to the requirements.

### Problem Description Summary:
The task is to find the number of different weights of the splits of a number \( n \). A split is defined as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sums to \( n \). The weight of a split is the number of times the first element appears in that split.

### Program Analysis:
The program takes an integer \( n \) as input and defines a function `func_1(num)` which counts the number of divisors of \( num \). The count is incremented for each divisor found, and if the divisor is not equal to the quotient when \( num \) is divided by the divisor, it increments the count again.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Misinterpretation of the Problem**: The program is counting the number of divisors of \( n \) instead of counting the different weights of the splits of \( n \). The weight of a split is not the same as the number of divisors.
2. **Missing Logic**: The logic to compute weights of splits is not present. The program does not generate or evaluate the splits of \( n \) and their respective weights.

### Example of Failure:
For \( n = 7 \):
- The valid splits are: 
  - Weight 1: [7]
  - Weight 2: [3, 3, 1]
  - Weight 3: [2, 2, 2, 1]
  - Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  
This gives us 4 different weights (1, 2, 3, 7).

However, running the provided program:
- It will simply return the number of divisors of 7, which is 4 (1 and 7, 7 being prime).

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description since it does not calculate the number of different weights of the splits of \( n \). Instead, it incorrectly counts the divisors.

Correctness: **False**.
