To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. We need to split an array into several parts such that:
   - The sum of elements in each new array is not zero.
   - The new arrays, when placed together, should form the original array.

### Program Analysis
The program first checks if the total sum of the array is not zero. If the total sum is not zero, it outputs "YES" and states that the entire array can be one subarray (from 1 to n).

If the total sum is zero, it then checks each element in the array. If it finds any non-zero element, it splits the array into two parts: one containing all elements up to that non-zero element and the other containing the rest of the array.

### Potential Issues
1. **Single Element Case**: If the array contains one element and that element is zero (e.g., `0`), the program correctly outputs "NO".
2. **Multiple Zeros**: If the array consists of multiple zeros (e.g., `[0, 0, 0]`), the program will output "NO", which is correct.
3. **Multiple Non-Zero Elements**: If the array has both positive and negative elements that sum to zero (e.g., `[1, -1]`), the program will output "YES" and split it correctly into two parts, which is also correct.

However, consider the case of an array with all zeros and one non-zero element at the end (e.g., `[0, 0, 1]`). The program will output:
```
YES
2
1 2
3 3
```
This is correct since the first subarray has a sum of zero, which violates the condition that each subarray must not sum to zero.

### Conclusion
The program fails to handle cases where it could inadvertently create a subarray that sums to zero, especially when the array has a combination of zeros and non-zero elements. 

Thus, there exists at least one case where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**.
