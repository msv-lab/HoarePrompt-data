Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails in scenarios where the total sum of the array is zero but there are non-zero elements that can be split into valid subarrays.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 -3 0 0
```

- The total sum of the array is `1 + 2 - 3 + 0 + 0 = 0`.
- The program will enter the `else` block and check each element. It finds `1` at index `0`, which is non-zero, and proceeds to print:
```
YES
2
1 1
2 5
```
- This output is incorrect because the subarray from index `2` to `5` sums to `2`, which is valid. However, the program does not consider that the first subarray's sum is `1`, and the second subarray's sum is `2`, which together do not violate the condition of having at least one zero-sum subarray.

### Additional Issue:
The program does not correctly handle cases where all elements are non-zero but still sum up to zero when combined. For example:
```
3
1 -1 0
```
This should print:
```
YES
2
1 1
2 3
```
However, the program would incorrectly return "NO" for cases like this if it encounters a zero in the array.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that all subarrays have non-zero sums, leading to its incorrectness.
