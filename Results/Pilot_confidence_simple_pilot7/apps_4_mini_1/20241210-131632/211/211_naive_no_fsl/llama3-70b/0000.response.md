Correctness: **False**

The provided program has issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the requirements of the problem description. 

1. The program uses a prefix sum array to determine partitions, but it fails to correctly handle cases where the prefix sum at any point is zero. Specifically, the logic in the loop that checks for valid partitions does not account for the possibility that a valid partition could exist at the end of the array.

2. The program incorrectly prints the last partition with the line `print(k, l, n)`, which is intended to be a partition but is not correctly formatted as a subarray since it does not check if the sum of the last partition is non-zero.

3. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   5
   1 -1 1 -1 1
   ```
   The correct output should be "YES" with partitions that do not sum to zero, but the program would incorrectly assess the partitions based on the prefix sums and may produce an invalid result.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
