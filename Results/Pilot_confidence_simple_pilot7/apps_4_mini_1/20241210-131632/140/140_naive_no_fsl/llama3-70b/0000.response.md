Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to check for cycles in a directed graph using depth-first search (DFS). However, it does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if the graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge.

### Issues:
1. **Cycle Detection Logic**: The program only checks if there is a cycle in the graph. If a cycle is detected, it immediately concludes that the answer is "NO". However, the problem states that you can remove at most one edge to potentially make the graph acyclic. The program does not analyze whether removing a specific edge in a cycle could result in an acyclic graph.

2. **Failure to Handle Edge Cases**: The program does not consider the scenario where there may be multiple cycles or where one removal could break multiple cycles. For example, in a graph with multiple edges forming cycles, it's possible that removing just one edge could resolve the issue, but the program does not check for this.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input which the program would incorrectly handle:
```
4 5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 2
4 1
```
This graph has a cycle (2 → 3 → 4 → 2). However, by removing the edge 4 → 2, the graph becomes acyclic. The program would incorrectly output "NO" since it only checks for the presence of a cycle without considering the possibility of removing an edge to resolve it.

Thus, since the program does not meet the specifications of the problem in all cases, the correctness is deemed **False**.
