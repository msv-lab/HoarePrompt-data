To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to find pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.
2. The input is an integer `n`, representing the number of shovels, where the cost of the i-th shovel is `i` burles.
3. The output should be the number of pairs of shovels that yield this maximum number of nines.

### Program Analysis:
The program takes an integer input `n` and calculates the number of trailing nines in the sum of shovel costs. It does this by:
- Initializing `max_9s` to 0.
- Using a loop to check how many times `(n + 1)` can be divided by 10 (which effectively counts the number of trailing zeros in `n + 1`).
- It increments `max_9s` for each division by 10.
- Finally, it calculates the number of pairs as `(n + 1) * max_9s` and prints the result.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of the Maximum Number of Nines**: The logic for determining the maximum number of trailing nines is based on the number of trailing zeros in `n + 1`. This does not directly correlate with the pairs of shovels that can be formed. For example, if `n = 10`, the program would calculate `max_9s` as 1 (because `11` has one trailing zero), but the valid pairs that sum to 19 (which has one trailing nine) are not accurately captured by this logic.
  
2. **Calculation of Pairs**: The formula `(n + 1) * max_9s` does not accurately represent the number of pairs that can be formed. The pairs should be derived from specific shovel combinations that yield sums ending in nines, rather than a direct multiplication.

### Example Case:
- For `n = 10`, the expected output should be `5` (pairs: (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,10)). However, the program would output `10` since `max_9s` would be calculated as `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of pairs of shovels that yield the maximum number of trailing nines. It fails to account for the specific combinations of shovel costs.

Correctness: **False**.
