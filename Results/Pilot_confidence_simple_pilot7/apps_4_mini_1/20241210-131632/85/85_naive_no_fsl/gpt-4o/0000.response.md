Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. 

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Pairs**: The logic used to calculate `max_9s` is based on checking if `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, which does not correctly identify the maximum number of nines that can be achieved from the sum of pairs of shovels. The condition should instead be checking pairs that sum to values ending in 9s, which the current logic does not account for.

2. **Example Failure**: For instance, if we consider `n = 14`:
   - The maximum number of nines at the end of pairs would be 1 (as shown in the problem description). The valid pairs are:
     - (1, 8)
     - (2, 7)
     - (3, 6)
     - (4, 5)
     - (5, 14)
     - (6, 13)
     - (7, 12)
     - (8, 11)
     - (9, 10)
   - The expected output is `9`, but the logic in the program would not yield this correct count due to its flawed approach.

3. **Not Handling All Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `n` is less than 10 correctly, as it does not enumerate pairs and check their sums directly.

Due to these issues, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, thus leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
