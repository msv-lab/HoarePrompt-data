To determine the correctness of the given program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func()`.

1. **Starting Point**: The program starts with `curr_lat = 90`, which represents the North Pole.
2. **Movement Logic**: The program processes each movement instruction:
   - If the direction is "North", it increases `curr_lat`.
   - If the direction is "South", it decreases `curr_lat`.
   - If the direction is "West" or "East", it ignores the instruction (this is a potential issue).
3. **Boundary Checks**:
   - The program checks if `curr_lat` goes out of bounds (less than -90 or greater than 90).
   - It enforces the rules that Limak can only move South from the North Pole and North from the South Pole.
4. **Ending Condition**: After processing all instructions, it checks if Limak ends at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`).

### Potential Issues:
- The program ignores movements in the "West" or "East" direction, which is not valid according to the problem description. If Limak is at the North Pole and receives an instruction to move "East" or "West", it should be invalid since he can't move in those directions. 
- The program does not handle the case where if Limak is at the South Pole and receives an instruction to move "East" or "West", it should also be invalid.

### Example that fails:
- Consider the input:
```
3
20000 South
10000 East
10000 North
```
In this case:
- Limak moves 20000 km South to the South Pole (valid).
- The next instruction is to move 10000 km East, which is invalid, but the program ignores it and continues.
- Then, Limak moves 10000 km North, which brings him back to the North Pole (valid).
- The final output would be "YES", but it should be "NO" because the East movement is invalid.

### Conclusion:
Due to the inability to correctly handle directions "East" and "West" and the resulting invalid movements, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
