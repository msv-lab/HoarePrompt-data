Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the case where `m` is such that no positive integer `n` exists for which `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. For example, if `m = 5`, the output should be `0` since there are no integers `n` such that `n!` has exactly 5 trailing zeroes. 

However, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly account for scenarios where the number of trailing zeroes jumps from one value to another, particularly when `m` is not achievable. The program will incorrectly return a range of integers when it should return `0`. 

For instance, if we input `m = 5`, the expected output is `0` but the program might not reach that conclusion due to the incorrect handling of the search for valid `n`. 

Thus, there are potential cases where the output does not meet the problem requirements, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
