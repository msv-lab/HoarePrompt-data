To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the problem description and consider potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the dimensions of the monitor and the state of the pixels correctly.
2. **Identifying White Pixels**: It correctly identifies the positions of all white pixels ('w').
3. **Finding Frame Bounds**: The program calculates the minimum and maximum coordinates of the white pixels, which is essential for determining the frame size.
4. **Frame Size Calculation**: It calculates the frame size based on the maximum distance between the identified white pixels.
5. **Frame Placement**: The program attempts to place the frame around the identified bounds, replacing black pixels ('.') with '+' where necessary.
6. **Output**: Finally, it outputs the modified pixel grid or -1 if the frame size exceeds the monitor dimensions.

### Potential Issues

1. **Frame Size Calculation**: The program calculates the frame size as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. This is correct for determining the size of the square frame, but it does not ensure that the frame can fit within the monitor's dimensions. The check `if frame_size > max(n, m)` is insufficient because the frame could fit within the monitor but still not be able to encompass all the white pixels.

2. **Frame Placement Logic**: The frame placement logic does not check if the calculated frame bounds are valid. For example, if the white pixels are located in such a way that they are not forming a rectangular shape or if they are isolated, the program will still attempt to create a frame that may not be valid.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the white pixels are located in such a way that a frame cannot be drawn around them. For instance, if the white pixels are in two separate regions, the program would still attempt to draw a frame, which is incorrect.

### Example Cases Where the Program Fails

- **Case 1**: If the white pixels are isolated and cannot form a valid square frame, the program will still output a frame. For example, consider the input:
    ```
    3 3
    w..
    ...
    ..w
    ```
    The expected output should be `-1` since no valid frame can be drawn around the white pixels.

- **Case 2**: If the white pixels are aligned in such a way that they form a line rather than a square, the program will incorrectly attempt to create a square frame. For example:
    ```
    5 5
    .....
    ..w..
    ..w..
    ..w..
    .....
    ```
    The expected output should be `-1`, but the program may attempt to create a frame that does not encapsulate the white pixels properly.

### Conclusion

Given the identified issues and potential cases where the program does not meet the problem requirements, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
