To analyze the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully examine its logic and how it aligns with the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: A positive integer \( n \) where \( 2 \le n \le 10^9 \).
2. **Output**: 
   - "YES" if a sequence of fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) can be formed such that:
     - \( b_i \) divides \( n \), \( 1 < b_i < n \)
     - \( 1 \le a_i < b_i \)
     - The sum of these fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).
   - "NO" if no such sequence exists.

### Program Logic:
1. The program checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2. If so, it returns "NO".
2. It then finds all divisors of \( n \) that fall within the specified range.
3. If no divisors are found, it returns "NO".
4. If divisors are found, it constructs fractions \( \frac{1}{d} \) for each divisor \( d \) and returns the count and the fractions.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Divisor Check**: The divisors are calculated from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} \). This is correct, but the program does not handle the case where \( n \) is prime. For a prime \( n \), the only divisors are 1 and \( n \), thus it should return "NO".
2. **Sum of Fractions**: The program does not check if the sum of the fractions actually equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). It simply returns the fractions based on the divisors found, without verifying the required sum condition.

### Example of Failure:
- For \( n = 5 \) (which is prime), the program will output "NO" correctly.
- For \( n = 8 \), the divisors are \( 2 \) and \( 4 \). The fractions would be \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \). The sum is \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \), which is not equal to \( 1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8} \). The program would still output "YES" because it doesn't validate the sum condition.

### Conclusion:
The program does not ensure that the sum of the fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). Therefore, it can produce incorrect outputs in cases where the sum condition is not met.

Correctness: **False**.
