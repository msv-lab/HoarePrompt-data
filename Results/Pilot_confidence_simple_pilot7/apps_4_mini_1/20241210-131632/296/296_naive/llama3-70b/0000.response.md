To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We need to find a sequence of fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) such that:
   - \( b_i \) divides \( n \), \( 1 < b_i < n \)
   - \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \)
   - The sum \( \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \)

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \).
2. **Special Case for n=2**: The program correctly identifies that for \( n = 2 \), there cannot be any fractions that meet the criteria since the only possible \( b \) would be 2, which does not satisfy \( 1 < b < n \). Thus, it outputs "NO".
3. **Handling Other Values of n**:
   - For \( n > 2 \), it outputs "YES" and assumes two fractions: \( \frac{1}{n//2} \) and \( \frac{1}{n} \).
   - It sets \( k = 2 \) and prints the two fractions.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Fraction for b_i**: The program uses \( n \) as a denominator for one of the fractions. However, \( b_i \) must satisfy \( 1 < b_i < n \). Since \( b_i = n \) does not satisfy this condition, this is a critical flaw.
- **Sum Calculation**: The program does not check if the sum of the fractions actually equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). It assumes that the chosen fractions will always satisfy the sum condition without verification.

### Finding a Counterexample:
Let's consider \( n = 4 \):
- The program would output:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 2
  1 4
  ```
- However, the fractions \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) does not equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \), which is correct in this case. But for \( n = 5 \), it would output:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 2
  1 5
  ```
  The sum \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{5}{10} + \frac{2}{10} = \frac{7}{10} \), which does not equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5} \).

Thus, there are cases where the program does not correctly compute the required fractions or their sum.

### Conclusion:
The program does not satisfy the problem conditions for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
