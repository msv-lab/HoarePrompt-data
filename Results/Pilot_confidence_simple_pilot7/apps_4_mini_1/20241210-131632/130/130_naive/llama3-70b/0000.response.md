To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program against the requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Ivan has `K` coins already and there are `N` different collectible coins.
2. `M` friends want to gift him coins, and they must each gift the same number of coins.
3. All gifted coins must be different.
4. At least `L` of the gifted coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Program Logic:
The program checks two conditions:
1. `M >= N - K + 1`: This checks if the number of friends `M` is enough to cover the number of different coins that can be gifted after accounting for the coins Ivan already has (`K`). Specifically, this checks if the friends can provide unique coins that Ivan does not already own.
2. `M >= L`: This checks if the number of friends `M` is at least as many as the number of new coins `L` that need to be added to Ivan's collection.

If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints `1`, indicating that each friend can gift one coin. Otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to meet the conditions.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. If `M` is greater than `N`, then it is impossible to gift distinct coins since there aren't enough unique coins available. For example, if `N = 5`, `M = 6`, `K = 0`, and `L = 1`, the program will incorrectly print `1` because it checks the conditions without recognizing the total number of distinct coins.
2. If `K` is equal to `N`, then Ivan already has all the coins. In this case, if `M > 0` and `L > 0`, it should return `-1` because no new coins can be gifted.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where `M` exceeds `N` or where `K` is equal to `N` properly. Therefore, it can produce incorrect results for those scenarios.

### Final Assessment:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for cases where the number of friends exceeds the available distinct coins, or where Ivan already owns all the coins.
