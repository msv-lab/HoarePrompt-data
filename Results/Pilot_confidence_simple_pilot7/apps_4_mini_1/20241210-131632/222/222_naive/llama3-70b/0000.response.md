To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and understand its logic.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers, considering that each action affects the skewer itself and `k` skewers on either side. The output should be the number of actions and the specific skewers that need to be turned.

### Analyzing the Code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (number of skewers affected on each side).
  
2. **Calculating Actions**: The line `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` calculates the minimum number of actions required. This is done by dividing the total number of skewers by the number of skewers affected in one action, which is `k * 2 + 1` (the skewer itself plus `k` on each side).

3. **Generating Skewer Indices**: The loop `for i in range(l):` generates the indices of the skewers that need to be turned. It appends `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` to the result list `res`. This effectively selects every `(k * 2 + 1)`-th skewer starting from the first.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of actions and the list of skewers.

### Identifying Edge Cases:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to check if it handles all potential cases correctly, especially edge cases.

- **Case 1**: When `n = 1` and `k = 0`. 
  - Expected output: 1 action (turn skewer 1).
  - The program correctly outputs `1` and `1`.

- **Case 2**: When `n = 2` and `k = 0`.
  - Expected output: 2 actions (turn skewers 1 and 2).
  - The program outputs `2` and `1 2`, which is correct.

- **Case 3**: When `n = 6` and `k = 1`.
  - Expected output: 2 actions (turn skewers 2 and 5).
  - The program outputs `2` and `1 6`, which is incorrect because it does not turn skewer 3.

### Conclusion:

The program does not account for all skewers being turned over in the case of `k > 0`. Specifically, it fails to ensure that all skewers are turned over when the `k` parameter allows for overlapping turns, as shown in the edge case above.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
