To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and potential edge cases.

The problem requires us to turn over all skewers with the minimal number of actions, where turning skewer number `i` affects skewers from `i-k` to `i+k`. The program defines a function that aims to achieve this by selecting skewers to turn based on the given `k`.

Let's break down the program:

1. It reads the values of `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes an empty list `positions` to keep track of the skewers that will be turned.
3. It uses a loop to increment `i` by `2 * k + 1` each time, starting from `1`, to determine which skewer to turn next.
4. Finally, it prints the number of actions taken and the positions of the skewers turned.

### Analyzing the Logic

- When `k = 0`, each skewer only affects itself. The program will turn every odd-numbered skewer (1, 3, 5, ...) until it exceeds `n`. This is correct since each skewer will indeed be turned.
  
- When `k > 0`, the program turns skewers at intervals of `2 * k + 1`. This means that each turn will affect `k` skewers on either side of the chosen skewer. 

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **Case with even `n` and `k`:**
   - Let's consider `n = 6` and `k = 2`. The program would select skewers `1` and `6`. 
   - Turning skewer `1` affects skewers `1`, `2`, `3`, and turning skewer `6` affects skewers `4`, `5`, `6`. 
   - This means skewers `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5` remain unturned, which is incorrect as not all skewers have been turned.

2. **General Case:**
   - For any `n` and `k`, if `n` is not covered completely by the chosen skewers based on the increment of `2 * k + 1`, some skewers may remain unturned.

### Conclusion

The program does not guarantee that all skewers will be turned over, especially when `n` is not a multiple of `2 * k + 1`. Thus, there are cases where the output will not satisfy the problem's requirement of turning all skewers.

Correctness: **False**.
