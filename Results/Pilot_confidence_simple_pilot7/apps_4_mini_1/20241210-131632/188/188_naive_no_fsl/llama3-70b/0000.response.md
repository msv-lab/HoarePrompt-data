Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the game can be fair. Specifically, it assumes that for the game to be fair, there must be exactly two distinct integers that each appear exactly `n/2` times. However, this is not sufficient to ensure fairness; it is also necessary that the total number of cards for both chosen integers equals `n`, which means each integer must appear exactly `n/2` times.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
In this case, there are two distinct integers (1 and 2), each appearing exactly twice. The program will output "YES" and `1 2`, which is correct. However, if we take the input:
```
6
1
1
1
2
2
2
```
In this case, the program will output "NO", but it is possible for Petya to choose `1` and Vasya to choose `2`, resulting in a fair game where Petya takes 3 cards and Vasya takes 3 cards. 

This example shows that the logic in the program is flawed, as it does not account for the possibility of having integers that can still form a fair game even if they do not appear exactly `n/2` times. 

Thus, the program fails to handle cases correctly, leading to an incorrect conclusion about the fairness of the game.
