Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for the negative angles correctly when calculating the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical.

For example, consider the input `-60`. The correct output should be `3`, as explained in the problem description. However, the program calculates the `normalized_angle` as `-60 % 360`, which results in `300`. Then, it calculates `turns` as `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4`, which evaluates to `0`. Thus, it incorrectly outputs `0` instead of the required `3`.

This demonstrates that the program does not satisfy the requirement for all potential inputs, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
