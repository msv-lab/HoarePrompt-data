To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise rotations needed to correct the orientation of an image taken by a camera that has been rotated by a specified angle (x degrees). The angle can be positive (clockwise rotation) or negative (counter-clockwise rotation).

### Requirements
1. The input is an integer representing the camera angle (between -10^18 and 10^18).
2. The output should be the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise rotations required to minimize the deviation from vertical.
3. The program should handle both positive and negative angles correctly.

### Program Review
The program provided is as follows:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360
    if x == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)
```

#### Logic Breakdown
- The input angle `x` is first normalized to a range of [0, 360) using `x % 360`.
- If `x` is 0, it correctly outputs 0, as no rotation is needed.
- For any other angle, it calculates the number of 90-degree rotations required using the formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`.

### Potential Issues
1. **Handling Negative Angles**: The program does not explicitly handle negative angles. For example, if `x = -60`, the normalized value will be `300` (since `-60 % 360 = 300`). The program will then calculate the number of 90-degree turns as `(300 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, which results in `4`. However, the correct answer should be `3` because:
   - 1st turn: 300 + 90 = 390 (30 degrees counter-clockwise)
   - 2nd turn: 390 + 90 = 480 (120 degrees counter-clockwise)
   - 3rd turn: 480 + 90 = 570 (210 degrees counter-clockwise)
   - 4th turn: 570 + 90 = 660 (300 degrees counter-clockwise)
   - The minimum deviation is achieved after 3 turns, not 4.

2. **General Cases**: The program does not correctly calculate the number of turns for angles that are not multiples of 90. For instance, if `x = 60`, the output will be `1`, which is correct. However, for `x = -60`, the output is incorrect as explained above.

### Conclusion
Since the program fails to correctly handle negative angles and does not provide the correct output for all cases, specifically for `x = -60`, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
