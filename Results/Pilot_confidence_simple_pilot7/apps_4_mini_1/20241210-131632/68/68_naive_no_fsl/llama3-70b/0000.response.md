To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code and compare it with the requirements.

The program reads three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes). Based on these values, it determines the output according to the following rules:

1. If `x > y + z`, it prints `+`. This means that even if all unknown voters downvote, upvotes still exceed downvotes.
2. If `x < y`, it prints `-`. This means that upvotes are fewer than downvotes.
3. If `x == y`, it checks if `z == 0`. If `z` is 0, it prints `0` (the votes are equal). If `z` is not 0, it prints `?` (the outcome is uncertain because unknown votes could tip the balance).
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to printing `?`.

Let's analyze the edge cases:

- **Case 1:** `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
  - Expected output: `?` (since the result can be either `+` or `-` depending on the unknown vote).
  - The code correctly outputs `?`.

- **Case 2:** `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`
  - Expected output: `-` (since there are more downvotes).
  - The code correctly outputs `-`.

- **Case 3:** `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
  - Expected output: `+` (since the only unknown vote can only increase the upvotes).
  - The code correctly outputs `+`.

- **Case 4:** `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`
  - Expected output: `0` (since upvotes equal downvotes).
  - The code correctly outputs `0`.

- **Case 5:** `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`
  - Expected output: `?` (since the outcome can be `+` or `-` depending on the unknown vote).
  - The code correctly outputs `?`.

Now, let's consider a case that might be problematic:

- **Case 6:** `x = 100`, `y = 100`, `z = 100`
  - Expected output: `?` (since the outcome can be `+`, `-`, or `0` depending on how the unknown votes are distributed).
  - The code incorrectly outputs `?`, but it doesn't handle the case where `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than `0` properly, as it doesn't differentiate between the scenarios.

In summary, the program fails to account for the scenario where both upvotes and downvotes are equal and there are unknown votes, leading to multiple potential outcomes. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
