Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly swaps the tiles at the positions of 'X' in both puzzles, which does not reflect a valid move in the context of sliding puzzles. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
AB
XC
AC
BX
```

- Bessie's puzzle starts as:
```
A B
X C
```
- Elsie's puzzle starts as:
```
A C
B X
```

In this case, the program would incorrectly attempt to swap the positions of 'X' in both puzzles, leading to a configuration that does not represent a valid sequence of moves. The correct approach would involve simulating the possible moves from the initial configurations rather than swapping the empty positions directly.

Additionally, the program only checks if the sorted configurations are equal after the swap, which does not guarantee that the two puzzles can reach the same configuration through valid moves. 

Thus, the program fails to handle the sliding logic correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
