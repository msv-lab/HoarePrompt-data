To analyze the provided program against the given problem description, we need to consider whether it correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum number of digits to delete from the number `n` so that the resulting number is divisible by `10^k`.

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to ensure that after deleting the minimum number of digits from `n`, the resulting number is divisible by `10^k`.
   - The number `10^k` means that the last `k` digits of the resultant number must be zeros.

2. **What the Code Does**:
   - The code takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - It initializes a counter `w` to count the number of digits removed.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `n` is divisible by `10^k`.
   - In each iteration, it increments `w` and removes the last digit of `n` (by integer division).

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The code does not handle the case where there are not enough zeros in `n` to satisfy the requirement of having `k` zeros at the end.
   - For example, if `n = 123` and `k = 2`, the code will enter an infinite loop because `123 % 100` is not zero, and it will keep removing digits without ever reaching a valid state since `123` does not have two trailing zeros.

4. **Conclusion**:
Given the above analysis, the program fails to account for cases where it is impossible to achieve the required number of trailing zeros, leading to potential infinite loops or incorrect outputs.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle cases where the number `n` does not contain enough zeros to meet the requirement for divisibility by `10^k`.
