Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the requirement that the resulting number should not have unnecessary leading zeros, except for the case where the result is exactly zero.

For example, consider the input `100 2`. The expected output is `2`, as we can remove the `1` and one of the `0`s to leave `0`, which is divisible by `10^2`. However, the program will continue to remove digits until `n` becomes `0`, counting the removals incorrectly.

Another problematic case is `10203049 2`. The expected output is `3`, as we can remove the `1`, `2`, and `3` to leave `0`, which is divisible by `10^2`. However, the program will not correctly arrive at this answer since it will not recognize the leading zero issue properly when constructing the final number.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements for all inputs, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
