To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic of the code against the problem description.

The goal is to partition a sequence of integers into two sequences `b` and `c` such that the difference `B - C` (where `B` is the sum of `b` and `C` is the sum of `c`) is maximized.

### Code Analysis
1. The program reads an integer `n`, which indicates the number of elements in the sequence.
2. It reads the sequence `a` of integers and sorts it in descending order.
3. It initializes sums `b` and `c` to zero.
4. The program then iterates through the sorted list:
   - It adds the elements at even indices to `b`.
   - It adds the elements at odd indices to `c`.
5. Finally, it prints the result of `b - c`.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- **Input**: `3`, `1 -2 0`
  - Sorted `a`: `[1, 0, -2]`
  - `b` will sum `1` and `-2` (at indices 0 and 2), resulting in `b = 1 - 2 = -1`.
  - `c` will sum `0` (at index 1), resulting in `c = 0`.
  - The output will be `b - c = -1 - 0 = -1`, which is incorrect as the expected output is `3`.

### Finding a Counterexample
To confirm the logic is faulty, let's examine a case:
- If `n = 3` and `a = [1, -2, 0]`, after sorting we have `[1, 0, -2]`.
- The sums calculated will be:
  - `b = 1 + (-2) = -1`
  - `c = 0`
  - Thus, `b - c = -1 - 0 = -1`, which does not match the expected output of `3`.

### Conclusion
The implementation does not correctly maximize `B - C` because it does not consider all possible partitions of the input array. The greedy approach of alternating sums based on indices does not guarantee an optimal result.

Correctness: **False**
