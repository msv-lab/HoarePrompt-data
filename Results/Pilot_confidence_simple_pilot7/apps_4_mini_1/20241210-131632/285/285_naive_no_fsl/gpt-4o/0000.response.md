Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Kolya can spend exactly `n` game-coins on houses, cars, and computers. It does so by iterating over the possible numbers of houses (`a`), and for each possible number of houses, it iterates over the possible numbers of cars (`b`). It then checks if the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`c`).

The nested loops ensure that all combinations of houses and cars are considered, and the modulo operation checks if the leftover coins can be spent on computers. Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), the program efficiently explores feasible combinations without exceeding the limits.

I cannot find a case where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements, thus confirming its correctness.
