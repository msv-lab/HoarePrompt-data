Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Kolya can spend all of his initial game-coins (`n`) on houses, cars, and computers. The program uses nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of houses (`a`), cars (`b`), and computes the number of computers (`c`) based on the remaining coins after accounting for the purchases of houses and cars.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The outer loop iterates over the number of houses (`a`) he can buy, ranging from `0` to `n // 1234567`.
2. The inner loop iterates over the number of cars (`b`) he can buy, based on the remaining coins after buying `a` houses.
3. The number of computers (`c`) is calculated based on the leftover coins after accounting for the purchases of houses and cars.
4. The program checks if the total expenditure equals `n`. If it does, it prints "YES" and exits.
5. If no valid combination is found after exhausting all possibilities, it prints "NO".

The program effectively explores all combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` that could sum to `n`, ensuring that it covers all potential cases. 

Based on the problem description and the logic implemented, I cannot find any case where the program would fail to provide the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct for all valid inputs within the specified range.

Thus, the final conclusion is that the program is correct.
