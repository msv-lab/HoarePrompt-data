To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Description:
Anton wants to find the positive integer that does not exceed `x` and has the maximum sum of its digits. If there are multiple integers with the same maximum sum of digits, he wants the largest one.

### Implementation Analysis:
1. The program reads an integer `x`.
2. It converts `x` to a string to analyze its digits.
3. It checks if the first digit of `x` is not '1':
   - If true, it constructs a candidate number by decrementing the first digit and filling the rest with '9's.
   - If false, it constructs a candidate number consisting entirely of '9's with a length one less than `x`.
4. It converts the candidate back to an integer.
5. It calculates the sum of digits for both `x` and the candidate using the `func_1` function.
6. It compares the sums:
   - If the candidate has a greater sum, it prints the candidate.
   - Otherwise, it prints `x`.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `x` is already composed of digits that are all '9's, e.g., `x = 999`. In this case, the candidate will be `999` which is equal to `x`, and it should correctly return `999`.
- If `x` is a number like `1000`, the candidate would be `999`, which is correct.
- The program does not account for cases where `x` is already the largest number with the maximum sum of digits. For example, if `x = 48`, the sum of digits is `4 + 8 = 12`, and it should return `48` as the answer since it is the maximum number with that sum.

### Example Cases:
- For `x = 100`, the candidate is `99`, which has a sum of digits `18`. The sum of `100` is `1`. Correct output is `99`.
- For `x = 48`, the candidate is `48`, which has a sum of digits `12`. The output should be `48`.
- For `x = 521`, the candidate is `499`, which has a sum of digits `22`, which is greater than `8` (the sum of `521`), so the output is `499`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the maximum sum of digits and handles the cases as described. However, it does not explicitly handle the scenario where the candidate number could potentially be less than `x` while still having the maximum sum of digits.

Since we have found that the program does not explicitly handle all edge cases properly (e.g., when `x` is a number like `10`, `20`, `30`, etc.), we can conclude that there are cases where it will not work as expected.

Therefore, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **False**
