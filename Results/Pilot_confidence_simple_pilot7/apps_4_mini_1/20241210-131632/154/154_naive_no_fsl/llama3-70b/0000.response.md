To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: Number of tasks.
   - `k`: Number of subtasks per task.
   - `M`: Total available time in minutes.
   - `t`: List of integers representing the time taken for each subtask.

2. **Points Calculation**:
   - Solving a subtask earns 1 point.
   - Solving all subtasks of a task earns an additional point (total of `k + 1` points for that task).

3. **Goal**:
   - Maximize the total points earned by solving subtasks within the time limit `M`.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum points that can be earned. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

- `dp[i][j]` is used to store the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved with `j` minutes using the first `i` subtasks.
- The nested loops iterate over each subtask and available time to fill the `dp` table.
- The final points are calculated by summing the maximum subtasks solved across all subtasks and checking how many complete tasks (subtasks) were solved to add the bonus points.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Incomplete Tasks Counting**: The program seems to count completed tasks using the condition `if dp[i][M] == i`, which is incorrect. This condition checks if the maximum number of subtasks solved is equal to the index, which does not accurately reflect whether all subtasks of a task have been solved.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not seem to consider the case where `M` is 0. In this case, Polycarp cannot solve any subtasks, and the output should be 0 points.
3. **Handling of `n`**: The program does not utilize the number of tasks `n` properly. It only calculates based on the subtasks and time, ignoring the fact that there are multiple tasks.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
1 1 0
1
```
Here, Polycarp has 0 minutes and cannot solve any subtasks. The expected output should be `0`, but the program would output `1` because it incorrectly assumes he can solve a subtask.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all edge cases correctly and has a logical flaw in counting completed tasks. Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
