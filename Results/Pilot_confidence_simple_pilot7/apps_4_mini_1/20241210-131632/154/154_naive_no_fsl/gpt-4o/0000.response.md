To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it against the problem description and the examples given.

### Summary of the Problem:
1. Polycarp has `n` tasks, each with `k` subtasks.
2. Each subtask `j` takes `t_j` minutes to complete.
3. Completing all `k` subtasks of a task gives `k + 1` points.
4. He has `M` minutes to maximize his points.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The program reads the input values for `n`, `k`, `M`, and the list of times `t`.
2. It calculates the total time required to complete all subtasks of a task.
3. It then iterates over the possible number of completely solved tasks (`complete_tasks`).
4. For each possible number of complete tasks, it calculates the time used and the remaining time.
5. It attempts to maximize the number of additional subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time.
6. Finally, it returns the maximum points calculated.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Zero Time Available (M = 0)**: 
   - If `M = 0`, Polycarp cannot complete any subtasks, and the expected output should be `0`. The program correctly handles this case by not entering the loop for complete tasks.
   
2. **Time for Subtasks Greater than M**:
   - If all times in `t` are greater than `M`, Polycarp should earn `0` points since he cannot solve any subtasks. The program should return `0` in this case, and it seems to handle this correctly as well.

3. **Exact Time Matches**:
   - If `M` exactly matches the total time for some complete tasks or for solving specific combinations of subtasks, the program should correctly account for these scenarios. The logic seems to account for this by checking the remaining time after completing tasks.

4. **Multiple Tasks with Varying Subtask Times**:
   - The program should handle various combinations of subtasks being solved across multiple tasks. The inner loop correctly calculates how many additional subtasks can be solved with the remaining time.

### Testing Against Examples:
- For the first example:
  - Input: `3 4 11` and `1 2 3 4`
  - Expected output: `6`
  - The program calculates correctly by completing one task and solving one subtask of another.
  
- For the second example:
  - Input: `5 5 10` and `1 2 4 8 16`
  - Expected output: `7`
  - The program correctly calculates that he can solve the first subtask of all tasks and some second subtasks.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program against the problem description and considering edge cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem statement. No counterexamples were found that would lead to incorrect behavior.

Correctness: **True**
