To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and see if it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The program takes two integers, `n` and `k`.
   - It is required to find `k` integers such that the sum of `2` raised to the power of each integer equals `n`.
   - The largest integer in the answer should be minimized, and if there are multiple valid answers, the lexicographically largest one should be returned.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - If `k > n`, it immediately returns "No". This is because if you need more integers than the total sum, it is impossible to achieve.
   - The program collects the indices of the bits set in the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Checking the Validity**:
   - If the number of bits (or powers of 2) needed to represent `n` exceeds `k`, it returns "No".
   - If there are fewer bits than `k`, it attempts to split the smallest bit until the number of bits reaches `k`.
   - The program sorts the bits in descending order to ensure that the output is lexicographically largest.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `k` correctly when `n` is 1 and `k` is 2. It outputs "Yes" and returns `[-1, -1]`, but this does not satisfy the condition that the sum of `2` raised to the powers must equal `1`. Thus, the output should be "No".

5. **Example Case**:
   - For input `1 2`, the expected output is "No" because it is impossible to express `1` as the sum of two powers of `2` (even with negative powers, the sum would not equal `1` with two elements).

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the program fails to handle certain cases correctly, particularly when `n` is less than `k`.

Correctness: **False**
