Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i` remain the same. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program exits the loop or if statement. Ensure that edge cases where `r` is exactly equal to `s[i]` are handled correctly.**
