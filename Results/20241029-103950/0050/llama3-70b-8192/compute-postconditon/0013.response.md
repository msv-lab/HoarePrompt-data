Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a sorted list containing integers from the input, `b` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `shares` is the result of previous shares incremented by r // s[i] if r is greater than or equal to s[i]. If r is less than s[i], the loop breaks, and `i` is a positive integer between 1 and 30**
