According to the code, the loop condition is `i < 0`. Since `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute, it means `i` is currently less than 0. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain the same, `i` is less than 1**
