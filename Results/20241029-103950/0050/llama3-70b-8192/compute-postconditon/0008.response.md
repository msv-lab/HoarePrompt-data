Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`, where `i` is a positive integer between 1 and 30. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a sorted list containing integers from the input, `b` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `shares` is the result of previous shares incremented by r // s[i], `i` is a positive integer between 1 and 30. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a sorted list containing integers from the input, `b` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `shares` is the result of previous shares incremented by r // s[i], `i` is a positive integer between 1 and 30.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a sorted list containing integers from the input, `b` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `shares` is the result of previous shares incremented by r // s[i], `i` is a positive integer between 1 and 30**
