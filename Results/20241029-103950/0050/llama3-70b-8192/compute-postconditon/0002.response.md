Example Answer:
The values in the list `s` are converted to integers using `map` and stored in list `b`. The input values are stored in list `s`, so after execution, list `b` will contain the same values as list `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers from the input; `b` is a list containing integers from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers from the input; `b` is a list containing integers from the input**
