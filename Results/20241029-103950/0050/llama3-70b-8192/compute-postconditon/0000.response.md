Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values extracted from the input after splitting. Since the input is assumed to be valid based on the preconditions, the values assigned to `n`, `m`, and `r` will be positive integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the output state is `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000**
