According to the code, the loop condition `while i < 0` indicates that the loop will never execute as `i` is initialized to be a positive integer. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will not run based on the current condition.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a sorted list containing integers from the input, `b` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `shares` is the result of previous shares incremented by r // s[i] if r is greater than or equal to s[i]. If r is less than s[i], the loop breaks. `i` is a positive integer between 1 and 30**
