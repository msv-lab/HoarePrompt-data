Example Answer: 
`shares` is assigned the value 0. This assignment does not directly affect the value of `r` which is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i], `shares` is 0.
Output State: **variable `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i], `shares` is 0**
