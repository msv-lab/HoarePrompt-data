Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, which are integers meeting the constraints 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. It calculates the count of specific values within the range from `l` to `r` based on the value of `k` and a dynamic programming array `dp`. The function then returns the difference between these counts modulo `MOD`. However, there is a missing implementation of the `count` function that is used within `func_1`, which might affect the functionality of the overall calculation. **
