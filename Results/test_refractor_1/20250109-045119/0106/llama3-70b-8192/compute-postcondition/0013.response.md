The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the constraints provided, the function should handle the following:

- `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\).
- `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and \(a \neq b\).

The output depends on the values of `a` and `b` relative to `n`, `m`, and `k`, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the constraints for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` and process the values of `a` and `b` according to the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts constraints for positive integers `n`, `m`, `k` (such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\)) and integers `a` and `b` (such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and \(a \neq b\)), and processes the values of `a` and `b` accordingly.**
