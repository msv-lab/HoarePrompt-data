The code calculates `min_floor_time` as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Given that `a_floor > b_floor`, the value of `a_floor - b_floor` is a positive integer. The variables `a_floor`, `b_floor`, `a`, `b`, `m`, `k`, `a_block`, `b_block`, `min_block_time`, `n`, and their relationships remain unchanged.

Let's denote `a_floor - b_floor` as `diff`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `diff * 5 + 10`.

Since the exact value of `diff` is not provided, we express `min_floor_time` in terms of `diff`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer equal to an input integer, `b` is an integer equal to another input integer, `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is the minimum of (absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, `n` minus this absolute difference) multiplied by 15, `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, and `min_floor_time` is `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`.**
