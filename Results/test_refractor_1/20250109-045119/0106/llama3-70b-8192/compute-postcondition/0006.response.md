First, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer entered by the user.
- `m` is an integer entered by the user.
- `k` is an integer entered by the user.
- `a` is an integer equal to an input integer.
- `b` is an integer equal to another input integer.
- `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`.
- `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
- `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
- `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.

### Code Execution:
```python
min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `min_block_time`:**
   - The expression `abs(a_block - b_block)` computes the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`.
   - The expression `n - abs(a_block - b_block)` computes the complement of the absolute difference within the range `[0, n]`.
   - `min` function selects the minimum value between the two computed values.
   - This minimum value is then multiplied by 15.

### Variables After Execution:
- `min_block_time` is assigned the result of the above computation, which is dependent on the values of `a_block`, `b_block`, and `n`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`) remain unchanged from their initial values or calculations.

### Specific Values:
- `a_block` = `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
- `b_block` = `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
- `min_block_time` = `min(abs((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 - (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1), n - abs((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 - (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1)) * 15`

### Output State:
**Output State: `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer equal to an input integer, `b` is an integer equal to another input integer, `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is the minimum of (absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, `n` minus this absolute difference) multiplied by 15.**
