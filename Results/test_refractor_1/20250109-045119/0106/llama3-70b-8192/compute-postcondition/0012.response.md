Output State: **`min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of (absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, `n` minus this absolute difference) multiplied by 15, `min_floor_time` is calculated as either `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` or `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10` based on the condition, and their sum is printed. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, `min_block_time`, and `min_floor_time` remain as per the initial conditions.**

Note: The actual values of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` are determined by the conditions described, but since the exact values of the inputs (`a_floor`, `b_floor`, `a_block`, `b_block`, `n`) are not specified, they are represented in terms of these inputs.
