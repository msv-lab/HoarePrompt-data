The code snippet calculates `b_block` using the formula `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. This does not affect `a`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `n`, `m`, or `k`. The only variable that changes is `b_block`.

- `a` remains an input integer.
- `b` remains an input integer.
- `a_floor` remains as `(a - 1) % m + 1`.
- `a_block` remains as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
- `b_floor` remains as `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
- `b_block` is now `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer equal to an input integer, `b` is an integer equal to another input integer, `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer equal to an input integer, `b` is an integer equal to another input integer, `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
