Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer equal to an input integer, `b` is an integer equal to another input integer, `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is the minimum of (absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, `n` minus this absolute difference) multiplied by 15, and `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`***
