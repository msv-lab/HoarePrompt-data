The code calculates `a_floor` as `(a - 1) % m + 1`. Since `a` and `b` are distinct integers in the range `[1, n·m·k]`, the calculation of `a_floor` only affects the variable `a_floor`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and their relationships remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer equal to an input integer, `b` is an integer equal to another input integer, and `a ≠ b`, `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`.**
