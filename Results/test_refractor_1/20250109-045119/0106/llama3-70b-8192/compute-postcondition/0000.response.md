`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which means they will take the values entered by the user, one for each variable. However, the specific values are not provided in the initial state, so we will represent them as the values entered by the user. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**
