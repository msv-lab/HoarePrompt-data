The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers entered by the user and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Before this, `a` and `b` are defined such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`. After executing the code, the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to the integers entered by the user, but they must still satisfy the conditions `a ≠ b` and both should be within the range `[1, n·m·k]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer equal to an input integer, `b` is an integer equal to another input integer, and `a ≠ b` and both are in the range [1, n·m·k]**
