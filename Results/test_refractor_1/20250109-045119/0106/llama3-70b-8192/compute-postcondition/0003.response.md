The code calculates `a_block` as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are already known from the initial state. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `a_floor` are updated or remain unchanged depending on the calculation.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer entered by the user.
- `m` is an integer entered by the user.
- `k` is an integer entered by the user.
- `a` is an integer equal to an input integer.
- `b` is an integer equal to another input integer.
- `a ≠ b`.
- `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`.

After executing the line:
```python
a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```

The value of `a_floor` remains the same as it was previously defined, and `a_block` is now assigned the new value. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer equal to an input integer, `b` is an integer equal to another input integer, `a ≠ b`, `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`**.
