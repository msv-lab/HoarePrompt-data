Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment under all circumstances. Specifically, the calculation of `min_floor_time` is flawed. 

In the given implementation, the time taken to move between floors is always calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` or `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`, which is incorrect because it does not account for whether Edvard needs to go up or down the stairs. The correct calculation should consider the absolute difference in floor levels and add 5 seconds for each floor, plus 10 seconds for waiting for the elevator if necessary.

For example, consider the following case:
- Input: `4 10 5`
- Edvard's apartment: `200` (4th block, 2nd floor)
- Natasha's apartment: `205` (4th block, 3rd floor)

The correct solution should involve moving 1 floor up, which takes 5 seconds, plus 10 seconds to wait for the elevator, making the total time 15 seconds. However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates this as:
```
a_floor = 2
b_floor = 3
min_floor_time = (2 - 3) * 5 + 10 = -5 + 10 = 5
```
This results in an incorrect total time of `min_block_time + min_floor_time = 15 + 5 = 20` instead of the correct 15 seconds.

To fix this, the program should correctly calculate the time taken to move between floors based on the absolute difference in floor levels.
