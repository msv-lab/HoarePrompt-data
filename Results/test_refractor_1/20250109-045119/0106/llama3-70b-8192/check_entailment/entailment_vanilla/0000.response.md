Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the scenario where both the starting floor and the destination floor are the same but the blocks are different. For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
4 10 5
105 106
```

In this case, both Edvard and Natasha are on the same floor (11th floor), but in different blocks (Block 2 and Block 3, respectively). The program will incorrectly calculate the time as the minimum block distance and the minimum floor difference, which does not account for the fact that Edvard needs to go from one block to another. 

The correct approach would involve calculating the minimum time to move between blocks and then moving within the same block to reach the desired floor. This requires considering both the horizontal (block-to-block) and vertical (floor-to-floor) movements. The current implementation only accounts for the vertical movement and does not handle the horizontal movement properly.
