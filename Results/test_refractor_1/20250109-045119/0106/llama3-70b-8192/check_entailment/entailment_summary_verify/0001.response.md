Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where both the starting floor and the destination floor are the same but the blocks are different. Specifically, the program only accounts for the vertical distance between floors and the horizontal distance between blocks, but it fails to consider the actual minimum time required to move between blocks when they are in different blocks even if the floors are the same. This oversight leads to incorrect calculations in scenarios where the blocks are different, as demonstrated in the example provided:

```
Input:
4 10 5
105 106
```

For this input, both Edvard and Natasha are on the same floor (11th floor) but in different blocks (Block 2 and Block 3, respectively). The program will incorrectly calculate the time as the minimum block distance and the minimum floor difference, without accounting for the fact that Edvard needs to go from one block to another. This results in an incorrect total time.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
