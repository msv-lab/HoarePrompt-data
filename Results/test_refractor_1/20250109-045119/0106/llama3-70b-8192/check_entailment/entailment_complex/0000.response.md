Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads three positive integers `n`, `m`, `k` from the first line and two distinct integers `a` and `b` from the second line. These values are within the specified ranges, ensuring that the input adheres to the constraints.

2. **Floor and Block Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the floor and block numbers for both `a` and `b`.
   - `a_floor` and `a_block` are computed as:
     ```python
     a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
     a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     ```
   - Similarly, `b_floor` and `b_block` are calculated for `b`.

3. **Minimum Block Time Calculation:**
   - The minimum time to travel between blocks is calculated as:
     ```python
     min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
     ```
   - This ensures that the program accounts for the circular nature of the building by considering the shorter path around the building.

4. **Minimum Floor Time Calculation:**
   - Depending on whether `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, the minimum time to travel between floors is calculated as:
     ```python
     if a_floor > b_floor:
         min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
     else:
         min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
     ```
   - The additional 10 seconds account for the elevator ride down to the ground floor.

5. **Output:**
   - The total time required for Edvard to reach Natasha is the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`, which is printed as the output.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, the program correctly implements the logic for calculating the minimum time required for Edvard to reach Natasha. The program handles all the necessary calculations and conditions as described, including the circular nature of the building and the different travel times between floors and blocks. Therefore, the program is correct.
