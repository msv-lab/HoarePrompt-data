Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error in calculating the `min_floor_time`. Specifically, the expression `+ 10` should be outside the parentheses to correctly account for the elevator wait time after moving between floors. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the difference in floor levels is exactly `m`, meaning the elevator ride would take `m` seconds, but the current implementation adds an extra 10-second wait.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
    a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
    b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    
    # Calculate minimum time to move between blocks
    min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
    
    # Calculate minimum time to move between floors
    if a_floor > b_floor:
        min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor - 1) * 5 + 10  # Subtract 1 to avoid double-counting the elevator wait
    else:
        min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor - 1) * 5 + 10
    
    print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
```

With this correction, the code should handle all cases correctly according to the problem description.
