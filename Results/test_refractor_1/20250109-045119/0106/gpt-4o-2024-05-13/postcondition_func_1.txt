The function `get_location` takes an apartment number as input and returns the corresponding block and floor numbers based on the provided formulas. The apartment number is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{apartment} \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\), where \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) are positive integers not exceeding 1000. After executing the function, the block number is calculated as \(\left(\text{apartment} - 1\right) // (m \cdot k) + 1\), and the floor number is calculated as \(\left(\left(\text{apartment} - 1\right) \% (m \cdot k)\right) // k + 1\). This function ensures that each apartment is uniquely mapped to a specific block and floor within a building layout defined by \(n\) blocks, \(m\) floors per block, and \(k\) apartments per floor. The function handles the specified range of apartment numbers and correctly maps them to their respective block and floor positions.
