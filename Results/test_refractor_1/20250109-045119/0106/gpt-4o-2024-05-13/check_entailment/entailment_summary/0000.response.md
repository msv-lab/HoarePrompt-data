Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the possibility that Edvard and Natasha might live on the same floor but in different blocks. In such cases, the direct walk time calculation using `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15` would not be accurate. Additionally, the code assumes that the target floor is always higher than the starting floor, which may not be the case. The function should consider both the absolute difference and the circular nature of the building.

To fix this, the code needs to handle the scenario where Edvard and Natasha are on the same floor but in different blocks more carefully. The correct approach would involve calculating the minimum time to reach the same floor level and then the minimum time to reach the same block.
