Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the scenario where the target floor is higher than the current floor after considering the optimal path. Specifically, the program calculates the minimum walking time based on the absolute difference between the blocks but does not account for the fact that moving up floors using the elevator might be faster than moving down floors.

For instance, consider the following case:
- Input: `n = 4`, `m = 10`, `k = 5`, `a = 200`, `b = 6`
- Expected Output: `39` (as per the example in the problem statement)
- Actual Output: The program might output an incorrect value due to not properly calculating the elevator usage for ascending floors.

To illustrate, let's break down the steps for this specific case:
1. **Current Position**: Edvard is at apartment 200, which is in block 4, floor 10.
2. **Target Position**: Natasha is at apartment 6, which is in block 1, floor 2.
3. **Optimal Path**:
   - Edvard needs to go from block 4 to block 1. The shortest path is to walk clockwise around the building.
   - Time to reach the first floor of block 4 via elevator: `10` seconds.
   - Time to walk from block 4 to block 1: `15` seconds.
   - Time to reach the second floor of block 1 via elevator: `1` second.
   - Total time: `10 + 15 + 1 = 26` seconds.

The program, however, incorrectly calculates the time as `39` seconds because it does not properly account for the elevator usage when moving up floors. Therefore, the program fails in this scenario and hence the correctness is **False**.
