Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment by considering the various possible movements (using stairs, walking between blocks, and using the elevator). The functions `func_1` and `get_location` handle the necessary calculations accurately:

1. `get_location` correctly determines the block and floor based on the apartment number.
2. `func_1` considers the time to exit the current block, the time to walk to the target block either directly or by going around the house, and the time to reach the target floor. 

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement without any missing logic or edge cases that would cause it to fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
