Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. The `get_location` function accurately maps the apartment number to its corresponding block and floor, and the `func_1` function correctly calculates the time required for each movement (using stairs, walking between blocks, and using the elevator). The output hints confirm that the `get_location` function works as expected, handling the specified range of apartment numbers and correctly mapping them to their respective block and floor positions. There are no contradictions or issues identified that would cause the program to fail based on the given problem description and inputs.
