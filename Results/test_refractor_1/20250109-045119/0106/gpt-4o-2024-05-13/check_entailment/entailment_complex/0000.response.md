Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment in all potential cases. Specifically, the code only considers the time to exit the current block if Edward is not already on the first floor, and it does not account for the possibility that Edward and Natasha might be in the same block. 

Consider the following case:
- Input: `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
- `a = 1` (Edward is in the first block, first floor, first apartment)
- `b = 2` (Natasha is in the second block, first floor, first apartment)

In this scenario, the code would incorrectly calculate the time because it assumes Edward needs to walk to another block and then go up the stairs, instead of simply using the elevator to go to the second block. The correct approach would involve checking if Edward and Natasha are in the same block, and if not, calculating the shortest path between the blocks.

The function `func_1` does not handle this edge case properly, leading to incorrect results in scenarios where Edward and Natasha are in different blocks but on the same floor. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
