Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment by considering the various movements (using stairs, walking between blocks, and using the elevator). The `func_1` function accurately calculates the time to exit the current block, the time to walk to the target block either directly or by going around the house, and the time to reach the target floor. The `get_location` function correctly determines the block and floor based on the apartment number. The annotations confirm that the program handles all necessary cases and potential edge scenarios as described in the problem statement. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
