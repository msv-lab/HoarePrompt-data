Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The program reads the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` from standard input.
   - It assumes valid inputs (as per the problem constraints) and performs no explicit validation checks for these assumptions.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as parameters.
   - It first calculates the block and floor numbers for both `a` and `b` using the `get_location` function.
   - It handles the scenario where `Edwards` is already on the ground floor (`first floor`).
   - It calculates the minimum time required to walk between blocks using either the direct path or the reverse path, whichever is shorter.
   - It adds the time required to go up to the target floor (`Natasha's` floor).
   - Finally, it returns the total time.

3. **Function `get_location`:**
   - The function takes an apartment number as input.
   - It correctly computes the block and floor numbers based on the apartment number using integer division and modulo operations.
   - These calculations align with the problem statement, where apartments are numbered sequentially across all floors and blocks.

4. **Time Calculations:**
   - The program accurately accounts for the time taken to reach the target floor, walk between blocks, and use the elevator.
   - The logic for determining the shortest path between blocks is correct, considering the circular nature of the building.
   - The time complexities for each operation match the problem requirements (e.g., 5 seconds per floor, 15 seconds per block transition).

Given that the program correctly implements all aspects of the problem statement and performs the necessary calculations without any logical errors, it can be concluded that the program is correct according to the problem description.
