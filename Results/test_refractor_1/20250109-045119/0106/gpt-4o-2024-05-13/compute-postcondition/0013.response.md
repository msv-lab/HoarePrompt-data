The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. The function calculates and returns `total_time` which is computed as `(10 + (floor_a - 1)) + min(abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15, (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15) + ((floor_b - 1) * 5)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns `total_time` calculated based on the given formula involving floor values and block differences.**
