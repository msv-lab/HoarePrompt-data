The code calculates the `block` number using the formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` and assigns the remainder of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)` to `floor_within_block`. 

Here’s the step-by-step analysis:

1. The `block` number is already calculated and stored in `block` as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
2. The `floor_within_block` is now assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, which represents the floor number within the current block.

Since the initial state of `block` was calculated and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, the updated output state includes both the `block` and `floor_within_block`.

Output State: **`apartment` is an integer representing a unique apartment number within the building, where 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k; `block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.**
