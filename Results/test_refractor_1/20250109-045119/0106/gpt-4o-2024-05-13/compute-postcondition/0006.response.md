Postcondition: ***`block_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`, `floor_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `floor_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`. If `floor_a` equals 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)`***
