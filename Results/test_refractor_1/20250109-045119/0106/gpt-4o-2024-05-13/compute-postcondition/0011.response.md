The code calculates `total_time` based on the given variables. Let's break it down step by step:

1. `total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`

   - `time_to_exit` is defined as `10 + (floor_a - 1)` if `floor_a` equals 1, otherwise `10 + (floor_a - 1)`. This means `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)` because both conditions are the same.
   - `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
     - `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
     - `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
   - `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.

Since the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `n`, `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` are already determined in the initial state, we can directly compute `total_time`.

Let's denote the initial values as follows:
- `block_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`
- `block_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`
- `floor_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`
- `floor_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`
- `n` is the total number of floors (assumed to be a known constant)
- `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)`
- `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`
- `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`
- `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`

Therefore, the calculation for `total_time` is:

```python
total_time = (10 + (floor_a - 1)) + min(abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15, (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15) + ((floor_b - 1) * 5)
```

The final `total_time` will replace the current value of `total_time`, but since `total_time` was not previously defined in the context of this example, it is now assigned this new value.

Output State: **`block_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`, `floor_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `floor_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`, `n` is the total number of floors, `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)`, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, `total_time` is `(10 + (floor_a - 1)) + min(abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15, (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15) + ((floor_b - 1) * 5)`**
