The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is an integer representing a unique apartment number within the building, where \(1 \leq \text{apartment} \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\), and \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\).

After executing the function body, the function calculates the block and floor based on the given formulae:
- Block: \((\text{apartment} - 1) // (m \cdot k) + 1\)
- Floor: \(\left(\frac{(\text{apartment} - 1) \% (m \cdot k)}{k}\right) + 1\)

Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding block and floor numbers.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment and returns the block and floor numbers based on the given formulas.**
