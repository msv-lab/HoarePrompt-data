The code calculates `reverse_walk_time` based on `block_a` and `block_b`. The value of `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. The other variables (`block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `time_to_exit`, and `direct_walk_time`) remain unchanged.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. `abs(block_a - block_b)` calculates the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`.
2. `(n - abs(block_a - block_b))` subtracts this absolute difference from `n`.
3. `% n` ensures the result is within the range `[0, n-1]`.
4. `* 15` multiplies the result by 15 to get the time in minutes.

Since the exact values of `block_a` and `block_b` are not specified, we represent the calculation in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`block_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`, `floor_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `floor_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`, `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)` if `floor_a` equals 1, otherwise `10 + (floor_a - 1)`, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.**
