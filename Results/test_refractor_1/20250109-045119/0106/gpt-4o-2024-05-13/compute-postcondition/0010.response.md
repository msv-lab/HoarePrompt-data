The code assigns the value of `floor_b - 1` multiplied by 5 to the variable `time_to_target_floor`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `time_to_target_floor` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`block_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`, `floor_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `floor_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`, `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)` if `floor_a` equals 1, otherwise `10 + (floor_a - 1)`, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`**.
