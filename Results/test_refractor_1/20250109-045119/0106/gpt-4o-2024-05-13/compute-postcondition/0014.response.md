Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the total time required for two people to meet at a specific floor in a building with `n` blocks per floor and `m` floors. The total time is computed based on several factors:

1. The initial exit time, which depends on the floor level (`floor_a`) of person `a`. If `floor_a` is 1, the exit time is 0; otherwise, it is `10 + (floor_a - 1)`.
2. The walking distance between the blocks of the two persons, considering both direct and reverse paths, and the time taken for each path is 15 minutes per block.
3. The time to reach the target floor (`floor_b`), which is 5 minutes per floor minus the first floor.

The function returns the total time as the sum of these components. Potential edge cases include when `floor_a` or `floor_b` is 1, and the function correctly handles these by setting the corresponding exit times appropriately. The function also considers the shortest path between the blocks, ensuring the most efficient route is taken.**

This summary covers all aspects of the function's behavior as defined by the code, including the handling of edge cases where the floor levels are 1 and the consideration of the most efficient path between blocks.
