The code calculates the block number (`block`) based on the given apartment number (`apartment`). The formula used is `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. This means that the block number is determined by dividing the adjusted apartment number (subtracting 1 first) by the product of `m` and `k`, and then adding 1 to the result.

Given the initial state where `apartment` is an integer representing a unique apartment number within the building, and the calculation for `block`, the output state will be:

- The value of `block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`apartment` is an integer representing a unique apartment number within the building, where 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k; `block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
