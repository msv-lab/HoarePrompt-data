The code updates the value of `direct_walk_time` by calculating the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`, taking the modulus with `n`, and then multiplying by 15. The values of `block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, and `time_to_exit` are not affected by this operation. 

Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. `direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`

This means `direct_walk_time` is now set to the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`, taken modulo `n`, and then multiplied by 15.

Since the exact values of `block_a` and `block_b` are not specified, we express `direct_walk_time` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`block_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`, `floor_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `floor_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`, `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)` if `floor_a` equals 1, otherwise `10 + (floor_a - 1)`, and `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.**
