The code calculates the minimum walk time between two locations, which is determined by the direct walk time and the reverse walk time. 

- `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
- `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.

The `min_walk_time` is then set to the minimum of these two times.

Since the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `min_walk_time`. However, we can express it in terms of the given variables.

Therefore, the updated state includes:
- `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, which are expressed as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15` and `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15` respectively.

Output State: **`block_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`, `floor_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `floor_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`, `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)` if `floor_a` equals 1, otherwise `10 + (floor_a - 1)`, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
