#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    block_a, floor_a = get_location(a)
    block_b, floor_b = get_location(b)
    if (floor_a == 1) :
        time_to_exit = 0
    else :
        time_to_exit = 10 + (floor_a - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`block_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`, `floor_a` is a return value from `get_location(a)`, `floor_b` is a return value from `get_location(b)`. If `floor_a` equals 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)`
    direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15
    reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15
    min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)
    time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5
    total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
    return total_time
    #`The program returns total_time which is calculated as (10 + (floor_a - 1)) + min(abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15, (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15) + ((floor_b - 1) * 5)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the total time required for two people to meet at a specific floor in a building with `n` blocks per floor and `m` floors. The total time is computed based on several factors:

1. The initial exit time, which depends on the floor level (`floor_a`) of person `a`. If `floor_a` is 1, the exit time is 0; otherwise, it is `10 + (floor_a - 1)`.
2. The walking distance between the blocks of the two persons, considering both direct and reverse paths, and the time taken for each path is 15 minutes per block.
3. The time to reach the target floor (`floor_b`), which is 5 minutes per floor minus the first floor.

The function returns the total time as the sum of these components. Potential edge cases include when `floor_a` or `floor_b` is 1, and the function correctly handles these by setting the corresponding exit times appropriately. The function also considers the shortest path between the blocks, ensuring the most efficient route is taken.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: apartment is an integer representing a unique apartment number within the building, where 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000.
def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return block, floor
    #block: \((\text{apartment} - 1) // (m \cdot k) + 1\), floor: \(\left(\frac{(\text{apartment} - 1) \% (m \cdot k)}{k}\right) + 1\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `get_location` takes an apartment number as input and returns the corresponding block and floor numbers based on the provided formulas. The apartment number is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{apartment} \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\), where \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) are positive integers not exceeding 1000. After executing the function, the block number is calculated as \(\left(\text{apartment} - 1\right) // (m \cdot k) + 1\), and the floor number is calculated as \(\left(\left(\text{apartment} - 1\right) \% (m \cdot k)\right) // k + 1\). This function ensures that each apartment is uniquely mapped to a specific block and floor within a building layout defined by \(n\) blocks, \(m\) floors per block, and \(k\) apartments per floor. The function handles the specified range of apartment numbers and correctly maps them to their respective block and floor positions.
