Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. The function takes a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. It returns a list of `n` empty dictionaries, as required. The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list containing `{}` (an empty dictionary) repeated `n` times. Since the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases beyond providing a non-negative integer and returning a list of empty dictionaries, the function satisfies these requirements for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
