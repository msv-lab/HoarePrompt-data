Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of `n` empty dictionaries. This perfectly aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to create a list of `N` empty dictionaries. The annotated version supports the correctness of the function by explicitly stating that it returns a list containing `{}` repeated `n` times, where `n` is a non-negative integer. Since the function handles all valid inputs as per the problem description and the annotations, the original assessment remains correct.
