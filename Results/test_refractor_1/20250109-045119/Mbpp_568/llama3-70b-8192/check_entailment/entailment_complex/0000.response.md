Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a list containing `n` instances of the empty dictionary `{}`. The provided code achieves this by using a list comprehension that creates an empty dictionary `{}` for each integer in the range from `0` to `n-1`, resulting in a list of length `n` filled with empty dictionaries. This logic holds true for all valid non-negative integers `n`, including the edge case where `n` is zero, in which case the function returns an empty list. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
