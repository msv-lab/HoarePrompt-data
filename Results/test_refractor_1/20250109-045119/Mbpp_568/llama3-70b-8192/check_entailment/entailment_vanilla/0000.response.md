Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries. For any positive integer `n`, the function will generate a list with exactly `n` elements, and each element will be an empty dictionary. This matches the problem description perfectly. Since the function behaves as expected for any input `n`, there are no potential cases where the program does not work as described.
