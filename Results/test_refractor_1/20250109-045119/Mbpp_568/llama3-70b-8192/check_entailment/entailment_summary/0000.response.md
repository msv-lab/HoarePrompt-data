Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries. It uses a list comprehension to generate a list containing `n` instances of the empty dictionary `{}`. This behavior is consistent with the problem description and the output hints provided. The function handles the edge case where `n` is zero by returning an empty list. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case as described.
