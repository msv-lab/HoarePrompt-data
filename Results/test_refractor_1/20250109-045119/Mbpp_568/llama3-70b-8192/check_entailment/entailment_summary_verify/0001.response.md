Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(n)` creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries, which matches the problem description. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, generating a list containing exactly `n` empty dictionaries for any valid non-negative integer `n`. There is no indication in the provided information that the function fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description or that the output hints suggest otherwise. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
