Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description by taking an integer `n` and returning a list of `n` empty dictionaries. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, creating and returning a list containing exactly `n` instances of the empty dictionary `{}`, with no additional elements or operations performed. This holds true for all valid non-negative integers `n`, including the edge case where `n` is zero, in which the function correctly returns an empty list. Thus, the function is correct according to the problem description and the provided information.
