Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly generates a list of `n` empty dictionaries, as described in the problem statement. The annotated version clearly supports this by indicating that the function returns a list containing `{}` repeated `n` times, where `n` is a non-negative integer. The function behaves as expected for all valid inputs, including the edge case where `n` is zero, in which it returns an empty list. There are no contradictions between the problem description and the behavior of the function as described in the annotations. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is valid.
