Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list containing `n` instances of the empty dictionary `{}`, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is zero by returning an empty list. No other edge cases or special conditions are necessary given the problem constraints, and the annotated version supports the correctness of the function's behavior.
