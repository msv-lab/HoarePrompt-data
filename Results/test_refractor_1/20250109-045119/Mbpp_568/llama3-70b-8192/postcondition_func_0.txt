The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list containing `n` instances of the empty dictionary `{}`. The function ensures that the list contains exactly `n` empty dictionaries, with no additional elements or operations performed. This holds true for all valid non-negative integers `n`, including the edge case where `n` is zero, in which case the function returns an empty list.
