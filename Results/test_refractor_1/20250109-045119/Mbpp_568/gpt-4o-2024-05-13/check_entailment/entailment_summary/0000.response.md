Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `N` and returns a list containing `N` instances of an empty dictionary. The code uses a list comprehension to generate the list of empty dictionaries. The provided assertions cover different values of `N`, including 0, 5, 6, and 7, and the function passes these tests. Since the code handles all tested cases and the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases that are not covered by the provided assertions, the program appears to be correct for every potential case.
