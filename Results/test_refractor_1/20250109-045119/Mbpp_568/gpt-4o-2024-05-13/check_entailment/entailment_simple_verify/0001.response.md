Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `N` and returns a list of `N` empty dictionaries. The provided test cases assert that the function works as expected for various values of `N`. Since the function correctly implements the required behavior and the annotations support this, the program is correct according to the problem description.
