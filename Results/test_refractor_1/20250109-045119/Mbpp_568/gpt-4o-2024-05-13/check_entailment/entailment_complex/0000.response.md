Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes a non-negative integer `N` as an argument and returns a list containing `N` instances of an empty dictionary. The function correctly handles the case where `N` is 0, returning an empty list. Additionally, the provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for various values of `N`. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
