Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an integer `N` as input and returns a list of `N` empty dictionaries. The assertions in the annotated program demonstrate that the function works correctly for different values of `N`. Specifically:

- When `N` is 5, the function returns a list containing 5 empty dictionaries.
- When `N` is 6, the function returns a list containing 6 empty dictionaries.
- When `N` is 7, the function returns a list containing 7 empty dictionaries.

The implementation `[{} for _ in range(N)]` creates a list with `N` elements, each being an empty dictionary `{}`, which exactly fulfills the requirement stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
