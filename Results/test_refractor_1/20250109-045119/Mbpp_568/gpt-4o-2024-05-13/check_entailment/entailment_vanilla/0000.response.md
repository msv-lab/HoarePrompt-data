Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries as described in the problem statement. The function uses a list comprehension to generate the list, which correctly initializes each dictionary in the list. The provided test cases cover different values of `N` (5, 6, and 7) and confirm that the function behaves as expected. Since the function generates a list of `N` empty dictionaries for these test cases and there are no other constraints or edge cases mentioned in the problem description, we can conclude that the function works correctly for the given requirements.
