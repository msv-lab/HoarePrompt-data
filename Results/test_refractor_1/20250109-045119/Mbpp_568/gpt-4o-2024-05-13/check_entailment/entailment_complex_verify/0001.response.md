Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries for the given test cases (5, 6, and 7). The function handles the case where `N` is 0 by returning an empty list, which is consistent with the problem description. There are no other edge cases or functionalities missing that would affect the correctness of the program. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** remains valid.
