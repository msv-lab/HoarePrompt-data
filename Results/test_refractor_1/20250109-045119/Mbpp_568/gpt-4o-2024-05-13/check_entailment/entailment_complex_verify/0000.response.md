Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries, as demonstrated by the assertions. The annotated version further clarifies that the function accepts a non-negative integer `N` and returns a list containing `N` instances of an empty dictionary `{}`, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
