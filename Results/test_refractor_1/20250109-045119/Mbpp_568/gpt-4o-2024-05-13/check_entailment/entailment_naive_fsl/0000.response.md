Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries. The function uses a list comprehension to generate the required list, which is a correct and efficient way to achieve this. The assertions provided in the test cases also validate the function for different values of `N` (5, 6, and 7). Since the function works correctly for the given examples and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
