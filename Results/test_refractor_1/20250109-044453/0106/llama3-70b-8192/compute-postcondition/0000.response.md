The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial conditions specify that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000. The values of `a` and `b` are also specified to be within the range of 1 to `n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`, but these variables are not affected by the given code snippet.

The code does not modify `a` or `b`, so their states remain unchanged. The code does modify `n`, `m`, and `k` by taking input and converting it to integers. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input and are positive integers between 1 and 1000.**
