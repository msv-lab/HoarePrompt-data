The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not specified in the initial state, we know that `a` and `b` are integers within the range `[1, n·m·k]` and `a` is not equal to `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input and are positive integers between 1 and 1000.**
