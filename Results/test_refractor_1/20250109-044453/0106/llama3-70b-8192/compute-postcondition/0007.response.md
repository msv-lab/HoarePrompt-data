Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\); `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and `a ≠ b`; `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000; `a_floor` is \((a - 1) \% m + 1\); `a_block` is \(\left(\frac{a - 1}{m \cdot k}\right) + 1\); `b_floor` is \((b - 1) \% m + 1\); `b_block` is \((b - 1) // (m * k) + 1\); `min_block_time` is \(\min(\text{abs}(a\_block - b\_block), n - \text{abs}(a\_block - b\_block)) * 15\). In this state, `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`.***
