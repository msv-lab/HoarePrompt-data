The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned in the constraints but are not passed as arguments to the function. The function returns a value based on certain conditions related to these parameters.

Given the constraints:
- `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.

The function's output cases are not explicitly provided, but based on the constraints, we can infer that the function likely performs some operation involving these parameters and returns a specific value depending on their relationship.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the relationships between the parameters n, m, k, a, and b, where n, m, k are positive integers between 1 and 1000, and a and b are integers between 1 and n·m·k with a ≠ b.**
