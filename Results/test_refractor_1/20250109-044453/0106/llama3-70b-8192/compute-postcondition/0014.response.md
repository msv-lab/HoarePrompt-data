Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the minimum time required for two people to meet at a given location. The function takes five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, representing dimensions and blocks, while `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and \(n \cdot m \cdot k\) representing the starting positions of the two people, with the condition that `a â‰  b`.

First, the function computes the floor and block indices for both `a` and `b` based on the given values of `m` and `k`. The floor index represents the position within the current block, and the block index represents the block number. It then calculates the minimum time required to move between the blocks (`min_block_time`) and the minimum time required to move within the same block (`min_floor_time`). If `a_floor > b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as \((a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10\); otherwise, it is calculated as \((b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10\).

Finally, the function prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`, which represents the total minimum time required for the two people to meet. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `a` and `b` are in the same block, and the function correctly handles these by only calculating the necessary time to move within the block.

The function does not return any value explicitly; instead, it prints the result.**
