The code snippet `print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)` does not change any of the variables' values; it only prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`. The initial state of the variables is as follows:

- If `a_floor > b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is \((a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10\).
- Otherwise, `min_floor_time` is \((b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10\).
- `min_block_time` remains unchanged.

Since no changes are made to the variables, the output of the print statement is simply the sum of the initial values of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.

Output State: **`a` is as initial, `b` is as initial, `m` is as initial, `a_floor` is as initial, `a_block` is as initial, `b_floor` is as initial, `b_block` is as initial, `min_block_time` is as initial, `min_floor_time` is as initial, and the output of the print statement is `min_block_time + min_floor_time`.**
