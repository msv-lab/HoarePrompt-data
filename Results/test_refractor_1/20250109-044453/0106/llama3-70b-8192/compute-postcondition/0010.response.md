Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\)
   - `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and `a ≠ b`
   - `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000
   - `a_floor` is \((a - 1) \% m + 1\)
   - `a_block` is \(\left(\frac{a - 1}{m \cdot k}\right) + 1\)
   - `b_floor` is \((b - 1) \% m + 1\)
   - `b_block` is \((b - 1) // (m * k) + 1\)
   - `min_block_time` is \(\min(\text{abs}(a\_block - b\_block), n - \text{abs}(a\_block - b\_block)) * 15\)
   - `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`

2. Code Execution:
   ```python
   min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
   ```

   - `min_floor_time` is calculated as \((b\_floor - a\_floor) * 5 + 10\)

3. Impact on Variables:
   - `min_floor_time` is now defined and has a value that depends on `b_floor` and `a_floor`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\); `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and `a ≠ b`; `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000; `a_floor` is \((a - 1) \% m + 1\); `a_block` is \(\left(\frac{a - 1}{m \cdot k}\right) + 1\); `b_floor` is \((b - 1) \% m + 1\); `b_block` is \((b - 1) // (m * k) + 1\); `min_block_time` is \(\min(\text{abs}(a\_block - b\_block), n - \text{abs}(a\_block - b\_block)) * 15\); `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`; `min_floor_time` is \((b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10**.
