Correctness: **False**

The program provided is not complete because it does not handle the import of the `math` module, which is necessary for using `math.pi`. Without this import, the code will raise a `NameError` when executed, indicating that `math` is not defined.

Additionally, the problem description is missing, so we cannot ascertain whether the function meets any specific requirements or conditions that might be implied by the description. Thus, we cannot guarantee that it behaves correctly for its intended purpose.

For example, if we try to call `func_1(5, 10)`, we will encounter an error due to the missing import statement:

```python
func_1(5, 10)  # This would result in a NameError due to 'math' not being defined.
```

Therefore, since there is a clear case where the program does not work as expected, the correctness is False.
