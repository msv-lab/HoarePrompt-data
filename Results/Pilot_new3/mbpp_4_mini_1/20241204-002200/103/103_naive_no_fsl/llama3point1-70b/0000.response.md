Correctness: **False**

The program appears to represent a function that calculates something based on the parameters `radius` and `height`, but without a problem description, it is unclear what the intended functionality is. 

However, looking closely at the implementation, the function seems to compute the lateral surface area of a cylinder (using the formula \(2 \pi r h\)). 

Here are some potential issues:
1. **Missing Import**: The program uses `math.pi` but does not import the `math` module. If the function is called, it will raise a `NameError`.
2. **Improper Input Handling**: The function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` are negative, which does not make sense in the context of geometric calculations. For example, calling `func_1(-1, 5)` would return a negative surface area, which is nonsensical.

Because of these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for correctness in terms of proper functionality and input validation.
