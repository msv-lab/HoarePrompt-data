Correctness: **False**

The program takes three integers as input: `t`, `s`, and `x`, and checks if the condition `(x - t) % s == 0 or (x - t) % s == 1` is satisfied to print 'YES' or 'NO'. 

However, this logic does not correctly account for the situation where `x` is less than `t`. If `x < t`, then the expression `(x - t)` will yield a negative value, which can lead to unexpected results when using the modulus operator. 

For example, consider the input `t = 5`, `s = 2`, and `x = 3`. Here, `(x - t)` equals `-2`. According to the current logic:

- `(-2) % 2` equals `0`, which results in 'YES'.
- However, if `x` represents a position that cannot be reached before time `t`, the output should actually be 'NO'.

Therefore, the program fails to handle cases where `x` is less than `t`, leading to incorrect results.
