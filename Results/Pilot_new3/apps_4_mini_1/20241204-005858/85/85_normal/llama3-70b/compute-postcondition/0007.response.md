The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables, `n` and `i`, remain unchanged; `n` is still an input integer such that \( n \geq 2(k + 1) \), and `i` is still \( k + 1 \). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that \( n \geq 2(k + 1) \); `i` is \( k + 1 \); `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that \( n \geq 2(k + 1) \); `i` is \( k + 1 \); `ans` is increased by 1.**
