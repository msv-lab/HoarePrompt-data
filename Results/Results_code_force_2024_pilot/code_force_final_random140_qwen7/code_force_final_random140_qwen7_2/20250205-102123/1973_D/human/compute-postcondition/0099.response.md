Output State: `m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k + 3`, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j` starting at 1 up to `k`. After the loop executes 3 times, `j` becomes `k + 3`. Since no changes occur to `m`, `n`, `k`, `p`, or `i` within the loop (other than the increment of `j` which is not tracked), these variables retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. Thus, after all iterations, `j` will be `k + 3`.
