Output State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` updates the value of `p` by calling the function `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, `p` is updated to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. All other variables (`m`, `n`, `j`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
