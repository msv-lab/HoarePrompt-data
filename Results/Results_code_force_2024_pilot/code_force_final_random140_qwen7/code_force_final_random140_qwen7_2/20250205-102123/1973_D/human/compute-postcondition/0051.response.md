Output State: **`i` is `n // k - 1`, `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is `k`, `p` is not equal to `n`**.

Explanation: The line `p = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`. All other variables (`i`, `m`, `j`, and `p != n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
