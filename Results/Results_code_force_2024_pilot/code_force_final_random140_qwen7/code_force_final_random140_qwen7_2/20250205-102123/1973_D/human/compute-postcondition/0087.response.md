Output State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`**

Explanation: The line `p = 0` sets the value of `p` to 0. All other variables (`m`, `n`, `j`, `k`, and `i`) retain their previous values as no operation was performed on them that would change their state.
