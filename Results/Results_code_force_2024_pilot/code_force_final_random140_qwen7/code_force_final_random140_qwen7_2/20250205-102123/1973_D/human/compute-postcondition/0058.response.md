Output State: **`p` is now `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `n` is an integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Additionally, since the condition `p >= n` was met and a loop or if statement was broken, this information is also included in the output state.
