Output State: **max_val is n, k is an input integer, n must be at least 1.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `max_val` will be set to `n`. This is because the loop iterates from `n` down to `1`, and for each iteration, it checks if `func_1(1, i * n) <= n`. The loop breaks as soon as it finds an `i` where `func_1(1, i * n) > n`. Since the loop starts at `n` and decreases `i` until it reaches `1`, the last possible value of `i` before breaking (if it ever does) would be `1`. However, given the conditions described, the loop does not break until it has checked all values from `n` down to `1`, and thus `max_val` is set to `n` after all iterations.
