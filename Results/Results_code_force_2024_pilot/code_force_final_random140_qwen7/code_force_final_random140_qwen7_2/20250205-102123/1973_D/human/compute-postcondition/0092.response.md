Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, k + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `m` is `i * max_val`.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `j` is `k + 1`.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - `i` is `n // k - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `k + 1`. This means the loop will run `k` times.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `k + 1`. For the next iteration, `j` should start from 1 again.
   - The value of `k` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `m` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `j` should be reset to 1.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `p` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`**
