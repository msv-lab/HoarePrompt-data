Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n // k`
- `i` must be greater than 0
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`
- `j` is 1
- `k` must be a positive integer

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `k + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - Therefore, `j` should be set to 2.

### New State:
- `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `p` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n // k`, `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 2, `k` must be a positive integer**
