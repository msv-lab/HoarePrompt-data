Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it processes the values of `n` and `k` and returns the result based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.**
