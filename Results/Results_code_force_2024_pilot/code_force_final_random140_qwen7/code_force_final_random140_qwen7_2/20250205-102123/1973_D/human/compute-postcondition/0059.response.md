Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code snippet is `for j in range(1, k + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `k + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p` is now `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `j` and `k`, we need to focus on these two variables.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been incremented from its previous value. Let's assume `j` was `j_prev` before the last iteration, then after the last iteration, `j` would be `j_prev + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `k + 1`. Therefore, `j` should be set to `j_prev + 1` and `k` remains unchanged (assuming `k` does not change within the loop).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `p` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`p` is now `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `k` is the same as before**.
