Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `j`, `k`, and the range `1, k + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `k + 1`. This means `j` starts from `1` and increments until it reaches `k + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `m` is `i * max_val`
   - `n` is an integer
   - `j` is `k`
   - `k` is a positive integer
   - `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`
   - `i` is `n // k - 1`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently `k` (the last value in the range), for the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented to `k + 1`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `k`, `p`, `i`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `m` remains `i * max_val`
   - `n` remains an integer
   - `j` changes from `k` to `k + 1`
   - `k` remains a positive integer
   - `p` remains `func_1(p + 1, m)`
   - `i` remains `n // k - 1`

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`**
