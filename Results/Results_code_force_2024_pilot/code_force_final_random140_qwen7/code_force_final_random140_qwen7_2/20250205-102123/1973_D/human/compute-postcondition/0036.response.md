Output State: **`i` is `n // k`, `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is assigned the value of the function call `func_1(p + 1, m)`. The values of `i`, `m`, `j`, and the condition of breaking out of the loop remain unchanged. The exact value of `p` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but it is now the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`.
