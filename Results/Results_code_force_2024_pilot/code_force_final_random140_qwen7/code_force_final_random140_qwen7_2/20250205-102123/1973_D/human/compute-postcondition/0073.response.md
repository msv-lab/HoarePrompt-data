Output State: **`p` is the result of applying `func_1` repeatedly `k` times starting from `p + 1` and using `m` as the second argument each time, `n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `k`, and `p` is equal to `n`, and `func_2(m)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_2(m)` calls the function `func_2` with the argument `m`. However, since `func_2` is not defined in the provided code, no further changes to the variables occur. The values of `p`, `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
