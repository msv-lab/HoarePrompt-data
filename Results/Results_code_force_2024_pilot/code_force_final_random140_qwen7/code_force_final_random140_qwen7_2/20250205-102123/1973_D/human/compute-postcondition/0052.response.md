Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variable `j` and its range. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `j`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` initialized to `k`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`. Since the loop starts with `j = k` and increments `j` in each iteration, the loop will run exactly once.

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that `j` is correctly set to `k` at the start of the loop. Additionally, we need to ensure that `j` is within the range specified by the loop condition (i.e., `1 <= j <= k`). Given that the loop starts with `j = k`, this condition is satisfied.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `i`, `m`, `p`, and `n` are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly affect whether the loop executes. However, they should remain consistent with the given initial conditions.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` must be `k`.
- `i` must be `n // k - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- `m` must be `i * max_val`.
- `p` must be `0`.
- `p` must not be equal to `n`.

Since `j` is the only variable in the loop head, we focus on ensuring it is correctly set to `k`.

**Final State:**
State: **`j` is `k`, `i` is `n // k - 1` and must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `0`, `p` is not equal to `n`**
