Output State: **`i` is `n // k`, `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the result of applying the function `func_2` with the argument `m`, `j` is `k`, and `p` is equal to `n`**.

Explanation: The code `func_2(m)` calls the function `func_2` with the argument `m`. The value of `m` is unchanged, and the value of `p` is now the result of calling `func_2(m)`. All other variables (`i`, `max_val`, `j`, and `n`) remain in their original states.
