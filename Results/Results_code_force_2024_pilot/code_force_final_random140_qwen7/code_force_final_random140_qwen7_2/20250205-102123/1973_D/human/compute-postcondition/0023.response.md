Output State: **`i` is `n // k`, `i` must be greater than 0; `m` is `i * max_val`**

Explanation: The variable `m` is assigned the value of `i * max_val`. Since `i` is `n // k` and `i` must be greater than 0, the value of `m` is calculated as `i * max_val`. The precondition that `i` is greater than 0 remains valid after the code execution.
