Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be 0, `max_val` remains unchanged, `m` will be `i * max_val`, `p` will be `n` if the loop conditions were met to execute until `i` reaches 0, otherwise `p` will be the last computed value of `func_1`, `j` will be `k + (n // k - 1)`, and `k` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `func_2(-1)` calls the function `func_2` with the argument `-1`. Since no specific implementation of `func_2` is provided, we cannot determine what changes it might make to the variables. However, based on the initial state, the following is true:

- `i` will be set to 0 after the call to `func_2`.
- `max_val` remains unchanged because no operation affecting it is specified.
- `m` will be `i * max_val`, which is `0 * max_val = 0`.
- `p` will be `n` if the loop conditions were met to execute until `i` reaches 0, otherwise `p` will be the last computed value of `func_1`. Since `i` is now 0, it implies the loop conditions were met, so `p` will be `n`.
- `j` will be `k + (n // k - 1)`, and `k` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is as described above.
