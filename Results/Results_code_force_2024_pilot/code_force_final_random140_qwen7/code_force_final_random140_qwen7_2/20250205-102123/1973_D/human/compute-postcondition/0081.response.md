Output State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `p` to 0, which changes the value of `p` from its previous value (`n`). All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
