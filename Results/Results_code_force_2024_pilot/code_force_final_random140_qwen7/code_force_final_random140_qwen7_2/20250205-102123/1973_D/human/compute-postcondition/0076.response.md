Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `n // k` to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts from `n // k` and decrements until it reaches `1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p` is the result of applying `func_1` repeatedly `k` times starting from `p + 1` and using `m` as the second argument each time.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `j` is equal to `k`.
   - `k` is the same as before.
   - `p` is not equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is decrementing `i` from `n // k` to `1`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than `1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `n // k - 1` (the next lower value of `i`).

5. **Keep other variables unchanged**: The variables `n`, `j`, `k`, and `p` remain the same unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`p` is the result of applying `func_1` repeatedly `k` times starting from `p + 1` and using `m` as the second argument each time, `n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `k`, `k` is the same as before, `p` is not equal to `n`, and `i` is `n // k - 1`**.
