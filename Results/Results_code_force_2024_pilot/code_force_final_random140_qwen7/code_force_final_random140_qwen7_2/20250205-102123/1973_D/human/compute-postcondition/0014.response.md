Postcondition: `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n) <= n`, `k` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is the result of `func_1(1, i * n)`. If `r <= n`, `max_val` is assigned the value of `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `r > n`, no change is made to `max_val`.
