Postcondition: `p` is now `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `k` is the same as before. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the if condition is not met.
