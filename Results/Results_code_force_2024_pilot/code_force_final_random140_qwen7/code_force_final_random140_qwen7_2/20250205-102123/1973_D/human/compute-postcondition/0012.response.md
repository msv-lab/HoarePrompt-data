Output State: **`max_val` is assigned the value of `i`, `k` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is the result of `func_1(1, i * n)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `r` was being calculated. The values of `max_val`, `k`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged, and we simply break out of the loop or conditional block.
