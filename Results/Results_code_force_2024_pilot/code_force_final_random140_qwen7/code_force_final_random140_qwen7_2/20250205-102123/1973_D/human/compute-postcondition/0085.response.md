Output State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` updates the value of `p` to the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `p` after the function call. However, we know that `p` is now the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. All other variables retain their previous values.
