Output State: `i` is `n // k`, `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will have reached its upper limit defined by the `range(1, k + 1)` which means `j` will be equal to `k`. The loop breaks when `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`, but since the loop runs completely, it means the condition `p >= n` was never met during the loop's execution. Therefore, `p` will be the result of applying the function `func_1` repeatedly `k` times, starting from `p + 1` and using the value of `m` each time.
