Output State: **`i` is `n // k`, `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there was no loop or conditional block specified in the code, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
