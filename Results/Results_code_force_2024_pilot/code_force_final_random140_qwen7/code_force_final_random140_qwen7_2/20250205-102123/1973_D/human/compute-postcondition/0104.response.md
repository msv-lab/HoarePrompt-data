Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be 0, `max_val` remains unchanged, `m` will be `i * max_val`, `p` will be `n` if the loop conditions were met to execute until `i` reaches 0, otherwise `p` will be the last computed value of `func_1`, `j` will be `k + (n // k - 1)`, and `k` remains unchanged.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will decrement until it reaches 0. At that point, `m` will be `0 * max_val`, which is 0. The value of `p` will either be `n` if the conditions inside the loop allowed it to reach this point or will be the last computed value of `func_1`. The variable `j` will have incremented by `k + (n // k - 1)` due to the inner loop running `k` times for each iteration of the outer loop.
