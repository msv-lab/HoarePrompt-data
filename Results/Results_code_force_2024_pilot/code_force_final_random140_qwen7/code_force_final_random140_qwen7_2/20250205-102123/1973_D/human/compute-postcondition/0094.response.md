Output State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is 0, `i` is `n // k - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. All the variables retain their initial states, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block if one was present.
