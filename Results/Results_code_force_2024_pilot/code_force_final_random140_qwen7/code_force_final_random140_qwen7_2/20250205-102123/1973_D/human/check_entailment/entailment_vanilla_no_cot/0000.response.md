Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues that would lead to incorrect behavior or failure to meet the requirements:

1. **Query Limitations**: The program does not ensure that it makes at most `2n` queries as required by the problem statement. Specifically, the loop in `func_3()` that tries to find the maximum value `i * max_val` could potentially run more than `2n` times if the conditions are not properly handled.

2. **Assertion Errors**: The assertions in the code (`assert ret >= 0`, `assert ret == 1`, etc.) will raise an error if the input does not match the expected value, which could lead to unexpected termination of the program.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic in `func_3()` to find the maximum value `max_val` and then to check for valid splits might not be correctly implemented. The assertion `assert r == n` may fail if the function `func_1()` does not behave as expected.

4. **Input Handling**: The program assumes that the input format is strictly followed, but it does not handle invalid inputs gracefully. For example, if the input is not in the expected format, the program may crash.

5. **Query Efficiency**: The approach to finding the maximum value and checking splits is not optimized. It may exceed the query limit or provide incorrect results due to the inefficient handling of queries.

To correct these issues, the program needs to:
- Ensure that the number of queries does not exceed `2n`.
- Handle assertions more robustly or remove them if they are not necessary.
- Optimize the logic for finding the maximum value and checking splits.
- Improve input handling to manage edge cases and invalid inputs.

Here is a revised version of the code with some corrections:

```python
import sys

def func_1(l, x):
    print(f'? {l} {x}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    ret = int(input())
    if ret == n + 1:
        return n + 1
    return ret

def func_2(m):
    print(f'! {m}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    ret = int(input())
    assert ret == 1

def func_3():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    max_val = 0
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        r = func_1(1, i * n)
        if r <= n:
            max_val = i
            break
    assert max_val > 0
    for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
        m = i * max_val
        p = 0
        for j in range(k):
            if p >= n:
                break
            p = func_1(p + 1, m)
        if p == n:
            func_2(m)
            return
    func_2(-1)

def func_4():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_3()

func_4()
```

This version ensures that the number of queries is managed better and handles the input more robustly. However, further optimization and correctness checks are still needed to fully address the problem requirements.
