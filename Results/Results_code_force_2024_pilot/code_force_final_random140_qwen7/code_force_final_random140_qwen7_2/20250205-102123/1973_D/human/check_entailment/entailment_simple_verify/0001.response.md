### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the function `func_3()` does not correctly implement the logic to split the array into `k` subarrays with the required product. Let's re-evaluate the code step by step to confirm this conclusion.

#### Key Points to Re-Check

1. **Finding `max_val`**:
   - The code correctly identifies the maximum value `max_val` such that `f(1, r) = max_val * n` for some `r`. This part is correct.

2. **Splitting the Array**:
   - The code attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has the product `m = i * max_val`. However, the logic in the inner loop is flawed. Specifically, the loop does not correctly ensure that each subarray meets the criteria.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_3()`

- **Finding `max_val`**:
  ```python
  for i in range(n, 0, -1):
      r = func_1(1, i * n)
      if r <= n:
          assert r == n
          max_val = i
          break
  ```
  This part is correct. It finds the maximum value `max_val` such that `f(1, r) = max_val * n` for some `r`.

- **Splitting the Array**:
  ```python
  for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
      m = i * max_val
      p = 0
      for j in range(1, k + 1):
          if p >= n:
              p = 0
              break
          p = func_1(p + 1, m)
      if p == n:
          func_2(m)
          return
  ```
  - The outer loop iterates from `n // k` down to 1, trying to find a suitable `m`.
  - The inner loop attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays with the product `m = i * max_val`.
  - The variable `p` is used to track the current position in the array. However, the logic to ensure that each subarray has the correct product `m` is flawed. Specifically:
    - The condition `if p >= n` and the subsequent reset of `p` do not correctly handle the splitting process.
    - The loop does not ensure that the subarrays are contiguous and meet the product requirement.

To correctly split the array into `k` subarrays, we need to ensure that each subarray's maximum value multiplied by its length equals `m`. The current implementation does not achieve this.

### Conclusion

The function `func_3()` does not correctly implement the logic to split the array into `k` subarrays with the required product. The inner loop does not properly ensure that each subarray meets the criteria.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
