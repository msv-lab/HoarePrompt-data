Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the hidden array contains elements that are not uniformly distributed, leading to incorrect splitting of the array. Specifically, the program assumes that the maximum value in the array is a good candidate for the initial `max_val` and does not properly verify that the resulting subarrays meet the required conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Calculation of `max_val`:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       r = func_1(1, i * n)
       if r <= n:
           assert r == n
           max_val = i
           break
   ```
   This loop tries to find the maximum value `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`. However, this does not guarantee that the maximum value in the array is `i`. It only checks if the product of the length and the maximum value equals `i * n`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
       m = i * max_val
       p = 0
       for j in range(1, k + 1):
           if p >= n:
               p = 0
               break
           p = func_1(p + 1, m)
       if p == n:
           func_2(m)
           return
   ```
   This part attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray's product of length and maximum value equals `m`. However, it does not ensure that the subarrays are valid according to the problem statement. For example, if the hidden array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`, the program might incorrectly assume that `m = 10` (since `2 * 5 = 10`) and fail to correctly split the array.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the hidden array contains elements that are not uniformly distributed, the program might not find a valid `max_val` or might incorrectly split the array.
   - The program does not handle cases where no valid split exists, which could lead to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
