Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly formats and sends a query to the judge and reads the response. It adheres to the problem's requirements for querying the judge.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly sends the final answer to the judge and reads the judge's response to verify correctness. However, the function does not return a value but instead relies on the judge's feedback to determine the outcome.
3. **Function `func_3`**: This function implements the logic to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the specified property. It correctly uses `func_1` to query the judge and updates the state accordingly. The logic to find `max_val` and then to determine `m` is sound and aligns with the problem statement.
4. **Function `func_4`**: This function correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_3` for each test case. It ensures that the program interacts with the judge according to the rules and handles the termination conditions properly.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Each function performs its intended task accurately, and the overall structure of the program follows the problem's specifications.

Correctness: **True**
