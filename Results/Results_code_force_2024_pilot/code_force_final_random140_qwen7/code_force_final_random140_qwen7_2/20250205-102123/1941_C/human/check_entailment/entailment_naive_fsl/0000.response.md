Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the string contains overlapping substrings like "pie" or "map". For example, in the input "ppiee", the program would incorrectly count two occurrences of "pie" instead of one, leading to an incorrect result. This can be demonstrated with the following test case:

Input:
```
9
ppiee
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
```

This is because the program increments `ans` twice when it encounters "pie" starting at index 0 and index 1, but it should only increment `ans` once since the overlapping "pie" should be counted only once. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
