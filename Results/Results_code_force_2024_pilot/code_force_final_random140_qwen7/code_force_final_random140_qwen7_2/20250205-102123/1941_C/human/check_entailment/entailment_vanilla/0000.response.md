### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to find the minimum number of characters to remove from the string `s` to eliminate substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The provided code attempts to solve this by iterating through the string and counting occurrences of "pie" or "map".

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `a`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0 and `i` to 0.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the string with a window size of 3 characters (`a[i:i+3]`).
   - If the substring `s` is either "pie" or "map", it increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1.
   - Otherwise, it increments `i` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The code prints the current substring `s` at each iteration, which is unnecessary and does not affect correctness but is a minor issue.
   - The logic to count deletions is flawed because it always increments `i` by 3 when "pie" or "map" is found, which means it skips over other potential matches.
   - The code should only increment `i` by 1 after processing each character, not by 3.
   - The code does not handle the case where "pie" or "map" overlaps with previous matches correctly.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to keep track of the current position and check for "pie" or "map" starting from the current position.
   - If a match is found, we should skip the matched part and continue checking from the next position.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a):
            if i + 2 < len(a) and (a[i:i+3] == 'pie' or a[i:i+3] == 'map'):
                ans += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the matched part
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect due to the flawed logic for counting deletions and handling overlapping matches. The corrected version should address these issues.

**Correctness: False**
