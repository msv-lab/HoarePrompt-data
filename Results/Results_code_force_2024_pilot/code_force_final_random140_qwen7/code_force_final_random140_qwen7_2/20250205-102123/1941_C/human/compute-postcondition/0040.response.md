Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1, `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 3` increments the value of `i` by 3. Initially, `i` was set to 0. After executing the code, `i` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
