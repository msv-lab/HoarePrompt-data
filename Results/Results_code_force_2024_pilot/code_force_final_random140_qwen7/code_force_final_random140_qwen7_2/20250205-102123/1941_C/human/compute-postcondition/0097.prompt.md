Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        print(s)
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `a` is the input string provided by the user; `ans` is the total number of occurrences where substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in `a` with a step of 3 characters; `i` is the final index value which is the last index processed by the loop.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the count of how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the string `a`, considering every third character. The variable `i` will be set to the index just beyond the last character checked by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` is the input string provided by the user; `ans` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`; `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i` is at most `len(a) - 3`; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the substring 'a'[i:i+3] of `a`; the loop terminates when `i` reaches `len(a) - 2` or when all occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' have been counted.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be the total count of substrings 'map' and 'pie' found in the string `a`. The variable `i` will be the index just after the last character checked, which means `i` will be at most `len(a) - 3`. The variable `num_iterations` will be the original input value minus 1, as it was initialized based on the original input value. The variable `s` will be the last 3-character substring checked during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` is the new input string provided by the user; `ans` is equal to the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`; `i` is the last index where the loop exits, which is either `len(a) - 2` if the last valid substring `a[i:i + 3]` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', or it is `len(a)` if the last valid substring is 'map' or 'pie'; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]` of `a`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` will hold the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`. The variable `i` will point to the end of the string or one past the last valid substring processed. The variable `num_iterations` will reflect the original input value minus 1, and `s` will be the last valid substring processed during the loop's execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
