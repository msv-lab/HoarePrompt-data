Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 3, `i` is now `i + 1`, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions that `i` must be such that after incrementing by 3 or 1, it is still less than `len(a) - 2`, and `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` remain valid. Therefore, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and the substring `s` will now start at index `i` and end at index `i + 2`.
