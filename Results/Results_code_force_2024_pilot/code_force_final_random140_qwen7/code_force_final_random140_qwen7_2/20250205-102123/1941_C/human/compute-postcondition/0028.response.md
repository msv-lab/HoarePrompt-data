Output State: `a` is the input string provided by the user; `ans` is the count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`; `i` is the index just after the last character of the last matched substring 'map' or 'pie', or `len(a)` if no such substrings are found.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the total number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the input string `a`. The variable `i` will point to the position right after the last matched substring, or it will be equal to the length of the string `a` if no matches were found.
