Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user; `ans` is 1; `i` is 3; `s` is the substring of `a` from index 0 to index 3, which is the first 3 characters of `a`.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is 0, so after executing `ans += 1`, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
