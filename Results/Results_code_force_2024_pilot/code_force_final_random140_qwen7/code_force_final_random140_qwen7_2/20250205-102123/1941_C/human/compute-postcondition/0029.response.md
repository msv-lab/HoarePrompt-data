Output State: `a` is the input string provided by the user; `ans` is the total number of occurrences where substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in `a` with a step of 3 characters; `i` is the final index value which is the last index processed by the loop.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the count of how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the string `a`, considering every third character. The variable `i` will be set to the index just beyond the last character checked by the loop.
