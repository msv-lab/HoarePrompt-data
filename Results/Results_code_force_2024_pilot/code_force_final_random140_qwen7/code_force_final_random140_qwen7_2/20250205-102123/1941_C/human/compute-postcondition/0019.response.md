Postcondition: **`a` is the input string provided by the user and `len(a)` must be greater than 3; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i + 3` and ending at index `i + 5` or index `i + 1` and ending at index `i + 3`; `i` is increased by 3 or 1; `ans` is 1 if the condition in the if part is met, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**
