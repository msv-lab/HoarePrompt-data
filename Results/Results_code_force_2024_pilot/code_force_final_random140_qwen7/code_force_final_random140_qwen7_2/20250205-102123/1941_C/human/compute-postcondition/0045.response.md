Postcondition: `a` is the input string provided by the user, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `i` is either 3 or 1, `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1, `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`. If the first 3 characters of `a` are 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `i` is 1.
