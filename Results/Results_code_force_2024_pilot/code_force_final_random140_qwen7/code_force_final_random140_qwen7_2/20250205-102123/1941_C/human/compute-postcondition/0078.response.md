Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is the new input string provided by the user.
   - `ans` is 1 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0.
   - `i` is 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1.
   - `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1.
   - `s` is the substring `a[0:3]` of `a`.
   - `i` is less than `len(a) - 2` and `s` is now updated to `a[i:i + 3]`, which is `a[0:3]` if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `a[1:4]`.

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on `i` and `len(a) - 2`.
   - Since `i` is already less than `len(a) - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is the new input string provided by the user; `ans` is 1 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0; `i` is 4 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the substring `a[0:3]` of `a`; `i` is less than `len(a) - 2` and `s` is now updated to `a[i:i + 3]`, which is `a[0:3]` if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `a[1:4]`.**
