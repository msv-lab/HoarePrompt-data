Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user and `len(a)` must be greater than 3; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` creates a substring `s` from the string `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`. Since the length of `a` is greater than 3, the indices `i` and `i + 2` are valid, and `s` will contain exactly 3 characters from `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
