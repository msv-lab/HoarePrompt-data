Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `a` is the input string provided by the user.
   - `ans` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.
   - `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i` is at most `len(a) - 3`.
   - `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1.
   - `s` is the substring `a[i:i+3]` of `a`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop terminates when `i` reaches `len(a) - 2` or when all occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' have been counted.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it increments `ans` if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - `s` will be updated to the new 3-character substring starting from `i`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.
   - `s` will be the new substring starting from `i`.

Given these points, let's determine the states that need to be adjusted:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `s` will be updated to `a[i:i+3]`.

Since the loop is controlled by the condition `i < len(a) - 2`, we need to ensure that `i` is still within this range for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Increment `i`**: Since the loop will increment `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to check if `i + 1` is still within the valid range.
2. **Update `s`**: `s` will be updated to the new substring starting from `i + 1`.

### Final State:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `s` will be `a[i:i+3]`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user; `ans` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`; `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i` is at most `len(a) - 3` and `i` will be incremented by 1; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the substring `a[i:i+3]` of `a` and will be updated to `a[i+1:i+4]` for the next iteration.**
