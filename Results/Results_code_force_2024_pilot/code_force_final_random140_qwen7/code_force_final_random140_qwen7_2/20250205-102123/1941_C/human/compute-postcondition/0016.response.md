Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user and `len(a)` must be greater than 3; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i + 3` and ending at index `i + 5`; `i` is increased by 3.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 3. Since `s` was originally a substring starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`, after incrementing `i` by 3, `s` now starts from index `i + 3` and ends at index `i + 5`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
