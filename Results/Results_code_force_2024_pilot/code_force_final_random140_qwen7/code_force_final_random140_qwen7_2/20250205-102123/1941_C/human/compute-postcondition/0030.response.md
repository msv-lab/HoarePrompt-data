To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the process:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is the input string provided by the user.
   - `ans` is the total number of occurrences where substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in `a` with a step of 3 characters.
   - `i` is the final index value which is the last index processed by the loop.

2. **Process**:
   - The loop iterates over the string `a` with a step of 3 characters.
   - For each position `i` in the string, it checks if the substring starting at `i` and having a length of 3 characters is either 'map' or 'pie'.
   - If the substring matches 'map' or 'pie', it increments `ans`.
   - After the loop completes, `ans` holds the total count of such occurrences, and `i` is set to the index just beyond the last character checked by the loop.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the total count of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a` with a step of 3 characters.

Given the above reasoning, the output will be the count of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a` with a step of 3 characters.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total count of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a` with a step of 3 characters)**
