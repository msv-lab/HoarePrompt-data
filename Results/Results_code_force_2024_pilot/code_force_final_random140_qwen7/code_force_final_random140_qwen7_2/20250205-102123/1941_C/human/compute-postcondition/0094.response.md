Output State: `a` is the new input string provided by the user; `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`; `i` is the final index where the loop terminated, which is either `len(a) - 2` if the last valid substring `a[i:i+3]` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', or it is `len(a)` if the last valid substring is 'map' or 'pie'; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the last valid substring `a[i:i+3]` checked during the loop execution.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `ans` will be the count of how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the string `a`.
- `i` will be the position just after the last valid substring `a[i:i+3]` that was checked, unless the last valid substring was 'map' or 'pie', in which case `i` will be set to `len(a)`.
- `num_iterations` will be the original input value minus one.
- `s` will be the last valid substring `a[i:i+3]` that was checked during the loop.
