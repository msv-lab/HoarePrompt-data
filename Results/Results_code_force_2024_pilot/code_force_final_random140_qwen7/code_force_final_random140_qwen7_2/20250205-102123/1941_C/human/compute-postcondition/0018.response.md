Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user and `len(a)` must be greater than 3; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i + 1` and ending at index `i + 3`; `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so the substring `s` now starts from `i + 1` instead of `i`. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
