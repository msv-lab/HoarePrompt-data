Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate a specified number of times.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. The input should be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop will run `t` times, where `t` is the input from the user, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

We need to ensure that `t` is within this range for the loop to execute.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
