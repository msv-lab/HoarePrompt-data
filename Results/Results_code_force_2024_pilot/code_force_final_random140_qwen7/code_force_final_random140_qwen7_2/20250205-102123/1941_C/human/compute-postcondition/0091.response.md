The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 7 to 8. The states of the other variables (`a`, `ans`, `num_iterations`, `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the new input string provided by the user; `ans` is 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1; `i` is 8; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is `a[1:4]`; `s` is `a[7:10]`.

Output State: **`a` is the new input string provided by the user; `ans` is 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1; `i` is 8; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is `a[1:4]`; `s` is `a[7:10]`.**
