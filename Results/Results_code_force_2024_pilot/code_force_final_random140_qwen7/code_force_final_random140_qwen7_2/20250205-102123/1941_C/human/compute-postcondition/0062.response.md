Output State: `a` is the input string provided by the user; `ans` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`; `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i` is at most `len(a) - 3`; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the substring 'a'[i:i+3] of `a`; the loop terminates when `i` reaches `len(a) - 2` or when all occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' have been counted.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be the total count of substrings 'map' and 'pie' found in the string `a`. The variable `i` will be the index just after the last character checked, which means `i` will be at most `len(a) - 3`. The variable `num_iterations` will be the original input value minus 1, as it was initialized based on the original input value. The variable `s` will be the last 3-character substring checked during the loop.
