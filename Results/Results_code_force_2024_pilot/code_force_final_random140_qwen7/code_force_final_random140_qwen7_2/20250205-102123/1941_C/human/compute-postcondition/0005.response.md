Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` (which is 0) to index `i + 3` (which is 3), so `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`.**

This means that the variable `s` has been assigned the substring of `a` starting from the first character (index 0) up to the fourth character (index 3). All other variables remain unchanged.
