Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. The initial values of `a`, `ans`, and `num_iterations` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables with their respective values.
