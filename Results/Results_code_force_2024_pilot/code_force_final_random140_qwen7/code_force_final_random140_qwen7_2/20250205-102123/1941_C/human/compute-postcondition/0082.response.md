Output State: **`a` is the new input string provided by the user; `ans` is 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1; `i` is 7 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 5; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is `a[1:4]` if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `a[1:4]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 1 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 0 otherwise, after incrementing, `ans` becomes 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 1 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
