### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case, reading the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes the number of test cases (`t`) and a list of tuples containing the length of the password and the password itself.
   - It initializes two empty strings, `letters` and `digits`, to store the letters and digits from the password.
   - It iterates through each character in the password, appending letters to `letters` and digits to `digits`.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. If they are not, it appends 'NO' to the results list and moves to the next test case.
   - It then checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter. This check is done by comparing the index of the last letter with the index of the first digit in the password. If the last letter appears after the first digit, it appends 'NO' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'YES'.
   - The function returns the results list.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which is correct.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement.
- The code handles all the required checks: sorting of letters and digits, and the condition about digits coming after letters.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation of the check for the condition where a digit comes after a letter. Specifically, the check `if letters and digits and (password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0])):` will fail for some edge cases. Let's consider the following example:

- Password: `ac123`
  - `letters = 'ac'`
  - `digits = '123'`
  - `letters[-1] = 'c'`
  - `digits[0] = '1'`
  - `password.index(letters[-1]) = 2` (index of 'c')
  - `password.index(digits[0]) = 3` (index of '1')

In this case, `2 < 3`, so the condition `password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0])` evaluates to `False`, and the function incorrectly returns 'YES' for this password, which should be 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it fails to correctly identify passwords where a digit comes after a letter.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
