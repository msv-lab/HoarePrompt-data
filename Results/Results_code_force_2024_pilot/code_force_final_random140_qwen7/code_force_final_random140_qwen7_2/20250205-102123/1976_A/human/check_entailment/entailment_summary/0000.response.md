Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly processes each test case.
2. It separates the password into letters and digits and checks if they are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. It also checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter, which would violate the conditions.
4. The logic in the function appears to be correct based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the execution summary and the code provided, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required checks for the password strength criteria.

Correctness: **True**
