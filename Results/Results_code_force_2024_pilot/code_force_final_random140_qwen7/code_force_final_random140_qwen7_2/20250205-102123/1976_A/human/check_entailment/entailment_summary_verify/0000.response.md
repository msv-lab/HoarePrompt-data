### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given examples.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Passwords must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
- All digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
- All letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- `func_1` takes `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (list of passwords).
- It checks if each password meets the specified conditions.
- If a password fails any condition, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
- If all passwords meet the conditions, it appends 'YES' to the results list.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the passwords.
   - It stores the test cases in a list of tuples `(n, password)`.

2. **Condition Checks:**
   - The program separates letters and digits into two strings: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It then checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by comparing the indices of the last letter and the first digit in the password.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where the password consists only of letters or only of digits.
   - It correctly identifies passwords like `123abc` as invalid because it checks the relationship between consecutive characters.

#### Example Walkthrough:
- **Testcase 1:** `12ac`
  - Letters: `ac` (sorted)
  - Digits: `12` (sorted)
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Result: `YES`

- **Testcase 2:** `123wa`
  - Letters: `wa` (sorted)
  - Digits: `123` (sorted)
  - Digit `3` comes after the letter `w`.
  - Result: `NO`

- **Testcase 3:** `allllmost`
  - Letters: `allllmost` (sorted)
  - Digits: None
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Result: `YES`

- **Testcase 4:** `ac123`
  - Letters: `ac` (sorted)
  - Digits: `123` (sorted)
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Result: `YES`

- **Testcase 5:** `011679`
  - Letters: None
  - Digits: `011679` (sorted)
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Result: `YES`

#### Verification:
- The program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description.
- It checks both the sorting of letters and digits and ensures that no digit comes after a letter.
- The provided examples confirm that the program works as expected.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly handle the condition where there should be no digit that comes after a letter. However, upon closer inspection, the program does indeed check this condition properly by comparing the indices of the last letter and the first digit in the password.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
