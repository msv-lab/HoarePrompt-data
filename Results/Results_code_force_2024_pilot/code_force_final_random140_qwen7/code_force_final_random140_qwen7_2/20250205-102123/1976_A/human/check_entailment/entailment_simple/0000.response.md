Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` processes each password according to the given conditions.
2. It separates the password into letters and digits and checks if they are sorted.
3. It also ensures that if both letters and digits are present, the last letter must come before the first digit in the password.
4. The logic implemented in the function correctly follows the problem statement:
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted.
   - It checks if the last letter precedes the first digit if both are present.
5. The function iterates through all test cases and appends the appropriate result ('YES' or 'NO') to the `results` list.
6. The final output matches the expected format and conditions specified in the problem.

Given this analysis, the provided implementation correctly verifies whether a password meets the criteria defined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
