You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input('Number of test cases, t = '))
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input('Length of password, n: '))
    password = input('enter passowrd: ').strip()
    test_cases.append((n, password))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        digits = ''
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        if letters and digits and (password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0])):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `test_cases`, a list of strings representing passwords. For each password in `test_cases`, it checks if the password meets certain conditions related to the order of letters and digits within the password. If all passwords meet the conditions, it returns a list containing 'YES'; otherwise, it returns a list containing 'NO' repeated `t` times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case, reading the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes the number of test cases (`t`) and a list of tuples containing the length of the password and the password itself.
   - It initializes two empty strings, `letters` and `digits`, to store the letters and digits from the password.
   - It iterates through each character in the password, appending letters to `letters` and digits to `digits`.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. If they are not, it appends 'NO' to the results list and moves to the next test case.
   - It then checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter. This check is done by comparing the index of the last letter with the index of the first digit in the password. If the last letter appears after the first digit, it appends 'NO' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'YES'.
   - The function returns the results list.

3. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, which is correct.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement.
- The code handles all the required checks: sorting of letters and digits, and the condition about digits coming after letters.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
