Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for ch in password:`. The objects involved here are `ch`, `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `password` is the corresponding password from the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `ch` will take each character from `password` one by one during the loop iterations.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters in `password`. Therefore, the loop will start executing if `password` is not an empty string.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `password` is derived from `test_cases`, we cannot directly adjust its value. However, we can ensure that `password` is not an empty string for the loop to start.
   - `ch` will be the first character of `password` when the loop starts, so we need to set `ch` to the first character of `password`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- Ensure `password` is not an empty string.
- Set `ch` to the first character of `password`.

Therefore, the modified state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is not an empty string, `ch` is the first character of `password`, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string**.
