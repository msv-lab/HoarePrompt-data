Output State: **`results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` must not be empty, `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the current character `ch`, `digits` is an empty string, the current character `ch` is alphabetic.**

The code `letters += ch` appends the current character `ch` to the string `letters`. Since `ch` is specified to be alphabetic, the updated value of `letters` includes the original value plus the new character. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
