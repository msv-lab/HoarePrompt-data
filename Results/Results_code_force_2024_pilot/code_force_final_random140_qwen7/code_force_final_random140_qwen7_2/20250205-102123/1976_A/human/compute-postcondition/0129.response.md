Output State: **`results` is now ['NO', 'NO', 'YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is the last character processed from `password`, `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password`, `digits` contains all numeric characters from `password`, and either the letters in `letters` are not sorted or the digits in `digits` are not sorted.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` was `['NO', 'NO']`. After appending `'YES'`, `results` becomes `['NO', 'NO', 'YES']`. The other variables (`n`, `password`, `ch`, `letters`, and `digits`) remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the sorting of `letters` and `digits` also remain the same as the initial state.
