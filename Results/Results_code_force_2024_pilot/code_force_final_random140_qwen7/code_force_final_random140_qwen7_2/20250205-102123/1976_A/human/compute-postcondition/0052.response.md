Output State: **`digits` now contains the character `ch`, `ch` is a digit, `password` is not an empty string, `letters` is an empty string, and `results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO'.**

Explanation: The code `digits += ch` appends the character `ch` to the string `digits`. Given that `ch` is a digit, `digits` now includes this digit. The other variables (`password`, `letters`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
