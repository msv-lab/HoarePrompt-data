Output State: **`results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the corresponding password from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `digits = ''` initializes a new variable `digits` and assigns it an empty string. This does not affect the values of `results`, `n`, `password`, or `letters`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
