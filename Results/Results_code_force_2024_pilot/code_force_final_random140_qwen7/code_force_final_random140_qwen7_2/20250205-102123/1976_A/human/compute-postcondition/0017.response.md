Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for ch in password:`. This means the loop variable `ch` is iterating over each character in the string `password`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `test_cases` must have at least one element.
   - `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`.
   - `password` must have at least one character.
   - `letters` is the string containing the first character of `password`.
   - `digits` is either the first character of `password` if it is a digit, or remains an empty string if it is a letter.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `password`, at the end of the previous iteration, `ch` would have been set to the current character being processed.
   - For the next iteration, `ch` will be set to the next character in `password`.
   - `letters` and `digits` will be updated based on the new value of `ch`.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `password` will have one less character because the loop is processing one character per iteration.
   - `letters` and `digits` will be updated based on the new character `ch`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the following changes:
- `password` will have one less character.
- `letters` and `digits` will be updated based on the new character `ch`.

Here is the final state for the next iteration:

State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` must have at least one character (one less than before), `letters` is the string containing the first character of `password`, and `digits` is either the first character of `password` if it is a digit, or remains an empty string if it is a letter.**
