Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `digits` as an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
