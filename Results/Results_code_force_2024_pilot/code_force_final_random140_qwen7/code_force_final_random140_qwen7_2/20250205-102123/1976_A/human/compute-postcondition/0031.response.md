Output State: **`results` is now ['NO'], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the original `password`, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the original `password`.**

Explanation: The code `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `results` is an empty list is no longer true since it now contains the element `'NO'`. The other variables retain their initial conditions.
