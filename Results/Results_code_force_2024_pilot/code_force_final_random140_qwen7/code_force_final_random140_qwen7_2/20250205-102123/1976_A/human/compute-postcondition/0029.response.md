Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the original `password`, and `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the original `password`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, all characters from the original `password` have been processed. The loop iterates over each character in `password`, appending alphabetic characters to `letters` and numeric characters to `digits`. Once all characters have been processed, `password` will be an empty string since it loses one character with each iteration until none remain. `letters` will contain all alphabetic characters from the original `password` in the order they appeared, and `digits` will contain all numeric characters from the original `password` in the order they appeared.
