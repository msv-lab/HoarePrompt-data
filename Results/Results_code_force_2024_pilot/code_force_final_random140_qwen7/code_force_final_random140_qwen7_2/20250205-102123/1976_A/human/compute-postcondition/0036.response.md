Output State: **`results` now contains 'NO', `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` is a string, `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the original `password`, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the original `password`, the last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` than the first character of `digits`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
