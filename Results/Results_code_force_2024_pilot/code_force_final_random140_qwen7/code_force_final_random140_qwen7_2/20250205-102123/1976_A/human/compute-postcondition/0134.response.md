Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `test_cases`, a list of strings representing passwords. For each password in `test_cases`, the function checks specific conditions and returns a list 'results'. The list 'results' contains either 'NO' repeated `t` times or 'YES' based on the conditions met during all iterations.**
