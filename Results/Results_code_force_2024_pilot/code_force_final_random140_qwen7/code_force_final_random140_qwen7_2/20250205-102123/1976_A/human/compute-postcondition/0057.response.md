Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for ch in password:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ch`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO'.
   - `n` is the next value in the sequence.
   - `password` is not an empty string.
   - `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the first character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` remains unchanged.
   - `digits` contains the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.

3. **Determine the next character `ch`**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `ch` from the `password` must be considered. Since `ch` is the variable being iterated over, it will be the next character in the `password`.

4. **Update the states accordingly**:
   - `ch` will be the next character in `password`.
   - `results` remains as it is (either an empty list or contains 'NO').
   - `n` remains as the next value in the sequence.
   - `letters` will be updated based on the new `ch` (if `ch` is alphabetic, concatenate it; otherwise, remain unchanged).
   - `digits` will be updated based on the new `ch` (if `ch` is a digit, include it; otherwise, remain unchanged).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ch` is the next character in `password`.
- `results` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `letters` is updated based on the new `ch`.
- `digits` is updated based on the new `ch`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is not an empty string, `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the next character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` remains unchanged, `digits` contains the next character `ch` if `ch` is a digit**.
