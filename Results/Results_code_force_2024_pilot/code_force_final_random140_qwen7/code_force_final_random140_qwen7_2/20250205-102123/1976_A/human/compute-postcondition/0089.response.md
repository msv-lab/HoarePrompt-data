Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for ch in password:`. The objects involved here are `ch`, `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `password` is the next password in the sequence.
   - `ch` is a character from `password`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters in `password`. Once `password` is exhausted, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop depends on the characters in `password`, we need to ensure that `password` is not empty. If `password` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `ch` will take each character one by one from `password`, starting from the first character.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `password` must not be empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` must not be empty, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string**
