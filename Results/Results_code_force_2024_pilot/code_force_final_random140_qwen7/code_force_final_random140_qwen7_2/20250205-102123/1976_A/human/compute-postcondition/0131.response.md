Postcondition: `results` is either ['NO', 'NO'], ['NO', 'NO', 'YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is the last character processed from `password`, `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password`, and `digits` contains all numeric characters from `password`. If the last letter in `letters` appears later in the password than the first digit in `digits`, `results` remains ['NO', 'NO']. Otherwise, `results` is updated to ['NO', 'NO', 'YES'] if either the letters in `letters` are not sorted or the digits in `digits` are not sorted.
