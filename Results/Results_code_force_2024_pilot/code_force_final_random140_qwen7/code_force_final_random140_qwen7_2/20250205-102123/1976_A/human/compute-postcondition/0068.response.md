Postcondition: **`results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the remaining part of the original `password` after removing the current character `ch`, `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the next character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` remains unchanged, `digits` is updated by adding the next character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after executing the if-else block. If the condition `ch.isdigit()` is true, `digits` is updated by adding the next character `ch`. If the condition is false, `letters` is updated accordingly, and `digits` remains unchanged.
