Postcondition: `results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is an empty string, `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared, `digits` contains all numeric characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared, and if the current value of `letters` is not sorted alphabetically or the current value of `digits` is not sorted numerically, `results` will contain 'NO'.
