Output State: **`results` is ['NO', 'NO'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is the last character processed from `password`, `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password`, `digits` contains all numeric characters from `password`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` is either `['NO']` or `['YES']`. After appending `'NO'`, `results` becomes `['NO', 'NO']`. The values of `n`, `password`, `ch`, `letters`, and `digits` remain unchanged.
