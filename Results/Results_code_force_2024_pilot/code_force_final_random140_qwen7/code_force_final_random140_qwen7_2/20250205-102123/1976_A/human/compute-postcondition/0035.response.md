Postcondition: **`results` is either an empty list or contains the string 'NO'. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). `test_cases` must have at least one element. `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`. `password` is a string. `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the original `password`. `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the original `password`. The last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` than the first character of `digits`.**
