Postcondition: **`results` is either an empty list or contains the string 'NO', `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the original `password`, and `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the original `password`. If the letters in `letters` are not sorted or the digits in `digits` are not sorted, `results` becomes ['NO']. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged.**
