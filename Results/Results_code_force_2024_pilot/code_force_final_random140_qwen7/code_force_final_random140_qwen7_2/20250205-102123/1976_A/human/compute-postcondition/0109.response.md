Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ch in password:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ch`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each character in the `password` string, assigning each character to `ch` in turn.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ch` is the current character being processed.
   - The next character in the `password` string will be assigned to `ch` in the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`results`, `n`, `password`, `letters`, `digits`) remain unchanged until the loop body modifies them.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `results` remains the same unless the loop body updates it.
   - `n` remains the same unless the loop body updates it.
   - `password` remains the same unless the loop body updates it.
   - `letters` and `digits` may be updated based on the current character `ch`, but since we are only looking at the start of the next iteration, these remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `ch` changes to the next character in the `password` string.

Given the above, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES']
- `n` is the next value in the sequence
- `password` is the same as before
- `ch` is the next character in `password`
- `letters` includes the current character `ch` if it is alphabetic
- `digits` includes the current character `ch` if it is a digit
- `digits` is updated to include the current character `ch` if it is a digit if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` is updated to include the current character `ch`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is the next character in `password`, `letters` includes the current character `ch` if it is alphabetic, `digits` includes the current character `ch` if it is a digit, and `digits` is updated to include the current character `ch` if it is a digit if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` is updated to include the current character `ch`.**
