Output State: **`results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is not an empty string, `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the next character `ch`, `digits` contains the same characters as before.**

Explanation: The code `letters += ch` appends the character `ch` to the existing string `letters`. The other variables (`results`, `n`, `password`, and `digits`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
