Postcondition: **`results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO'. If the last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` than the first character of `digits`, `results` becomes ['NO']. Otherwise, 'YES' is appended to `results`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `results` will either remain unchanged as an empty list or contain 'NO'. If the condition inside the if statement is true (i.e., the last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` than the first character of `digits`), `results` will become ['NO']. Otherwise, 'YES' will be appended to `results`, indicating that the condition is false.
