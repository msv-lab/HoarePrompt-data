Output State: **`results` is either ['NO', 'NO', 'YES'] or ['YES'] based on the conditions met during all iterations.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `results` list will contain either 'NO' or 'YES' for each iteration based on the conditions specified within the loop. If for any password, the alphabetic characters (`letters`) are not sorted in ascending order, the digits are not sorted in ascending order, or the last alphabetic character appears after the first digit in the password, 'NO' will be appended to `results`. If none of these conditions are met for any password, 'YES' will be appended for each iteration. The final state of `results` will depend on whether any of the 'NO' conditions were triggered during the processing of all passwords.
