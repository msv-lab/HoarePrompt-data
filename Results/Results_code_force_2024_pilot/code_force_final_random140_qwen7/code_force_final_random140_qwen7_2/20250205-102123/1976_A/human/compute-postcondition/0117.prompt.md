Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the next password in the sequence, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` must not be empty, `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the current character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `digits` is the concatenation of the original `digits` and the current character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is the next character in `password`, `letters` includes the current character `ch` if it is alphabetic, `digits` includes the current character `ch` if it is a digit, and `digits` is updated to include the current character `ch` if it is a digit if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` is updated to include the current character `ch`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is the next character in `password`, `letters` includes the current character `ch` if it is alphabetic, and `digits` includes the current character `ch` if it is a digit. If `ch` is alphabetic, `letters` is updated to include `ch`; if `ch` is a digit, `digits` is updated to include `ch`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
