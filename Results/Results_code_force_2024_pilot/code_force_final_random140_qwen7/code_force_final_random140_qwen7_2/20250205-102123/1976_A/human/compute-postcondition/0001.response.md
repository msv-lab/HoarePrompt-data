Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for (n, password) in test_cases:`. The objects involved here are `n`, `password`, and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of strings where each string represents a password of length \(1 \leq n \leq 20\) consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `test_cases`. Therefore, `test_cases` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each element in `test_cases`, the first iteration requires `test_cases` to have at least one element.
   - For the first iteration, `n` will be the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, and `password` will be the second element of the tuple.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `test_cases` must have at least one element.
- `n` will be the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`.
- `password` will be the second element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, and `password` is the second element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`**.
