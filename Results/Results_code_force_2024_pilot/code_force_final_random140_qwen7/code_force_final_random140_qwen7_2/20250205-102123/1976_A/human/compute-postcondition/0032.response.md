Output State: **`results` is now ['NO'], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the original `password`, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the original `password`, and we continue the loop or block of code.**

The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values but instead moves the control to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration or statement.
