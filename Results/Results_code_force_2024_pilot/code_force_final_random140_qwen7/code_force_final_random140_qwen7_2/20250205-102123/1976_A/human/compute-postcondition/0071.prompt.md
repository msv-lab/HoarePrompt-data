Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the corresponding password from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is not an empty string, `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the first character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` remains unchanged and `digits` contains the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is not an empty string, `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the next character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` remains unchanged, `digits` contains the next character `ch` if `ch` is a digit and `digits` is updated by adding the next character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the remaining part of the original `password` after removing the current character `ch`, `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the next character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` remains unchanged, `digits` is updated by adding the next character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
