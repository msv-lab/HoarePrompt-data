Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least one element (one less than before), `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of key `i` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already present, otherwise it is set to 1, and `ans` is equal to `k - 1`**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `k - 1` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `hashmap` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans` is now set to `k - 1`.
