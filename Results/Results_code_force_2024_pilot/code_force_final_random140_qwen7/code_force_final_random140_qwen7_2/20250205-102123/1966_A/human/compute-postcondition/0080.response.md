Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `arrC = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arrC`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
