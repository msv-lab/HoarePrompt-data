Output State: **`arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `arrC`, `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is `k - 1` if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`**.

This means that the value of `i` (which is the third element of `arrC`) is used to increment the count in the `hashmap` for that key. If the count of `i` in `hashmap` is now greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k - 1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
