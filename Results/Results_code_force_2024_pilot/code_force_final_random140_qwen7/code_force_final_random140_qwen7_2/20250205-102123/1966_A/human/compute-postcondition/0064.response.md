Output State: **`arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `arrC`, and `hashmap[i]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `i` is present in `hashmap`; `ans` is `k - 1`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to `k - 1`, while the lists `arrC` and the dictionary `hashmap` remain unchanged from their initial states.
