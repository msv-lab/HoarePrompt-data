Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `ans` is `n`, `hashmap` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in arrC:
    if i in hashmap:
        hashmap[i] += 1
    else:
        hashmap[i] = 1
    if hashmap[i] >= k:
        ans = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arrC`. If `i` is in `hashmap`, then `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1, and if `i` is not in `hashmap`, then `hashmap[i]` is set to 1. After executing the if-else block, if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1 (or remains unchanged if already >= k), and `ans` is `k - 1`. If `hashmap[i]` is less than `k`, then `hashmap[i]` is set to 1 (or incremented to reach at least `k` if it was previously incremented).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `arrC`, and `hashmap[i]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `i` is present in `hashmap`; if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `k - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `arrC`, `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `hashmap`, and set to 1 if `i` was not in `hashmap`. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `k - 1`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
