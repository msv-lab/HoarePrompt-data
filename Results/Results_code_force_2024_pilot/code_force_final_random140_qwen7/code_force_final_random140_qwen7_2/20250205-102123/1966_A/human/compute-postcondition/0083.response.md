Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arrC:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `arrC`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is a variable that will take on each value from the list `arrC` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `arrC` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `arrC`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the above understanding**:
   - Since `arrC` is a list of integers, and the loop will iterate over each element in `arrC`, `arrC` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will take on the values from `arrC` starting from the first element, but we don't need to specify its exact value initially as long as `arrC` has at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is `n`
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces
- `hashmap` is an empty dictionary

We need to adjust the state of `arrC` to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, the state should reflect that `arrC` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is an empty dictionary**
