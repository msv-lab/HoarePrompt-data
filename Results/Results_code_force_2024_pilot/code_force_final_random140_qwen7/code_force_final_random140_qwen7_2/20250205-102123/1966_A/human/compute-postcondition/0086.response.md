Output State: **`ans` is `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is the original value plus 1, and the current value of `i` is in `hashmap`.**

This means that the value of `i` in the `hashmap` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
