Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split, `n` is the original length of `arrC`, `k` retains its original value, `hashmap` contains counts of each integer in `arrC`, and `ans` is `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` appears `k` or more times; otherwise, `ans` remains `n` (the original value of `ans`).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed for all elements in `arrC`, the `hashmap` will contain the frequency count of each unique integer in the list. The variable `ans` will be `k - 1` if any integer in the list appears `k` or more times, otherwise, `ans` will retain its original value of `n`.
