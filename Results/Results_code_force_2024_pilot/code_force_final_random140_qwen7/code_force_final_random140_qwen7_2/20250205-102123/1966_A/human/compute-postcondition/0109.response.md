Postcondition: **`ans` is `k - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element (now missing the first element), `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of the next `i` in `arrC` is incremented by 1 if it exists, or added with the value `1` if it does not exist, and the value of `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1 for the next `i` in `arrC` if `i` is in `hashmap`, otherwise the value of `hashmap[i]` is set to `1`. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged; otherwise, the value of `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether `i` is in `hashmap` or not, the operations on `hashmap` will either increment the value of `hashmap[i]` by 1 if `i` is present, or add a new entry with value 1 if `i` is not present. If `hashmap[i]` reaches or exceeds `k`, no further changes are made to `hashmap`; otherwise, the count for `i` in `hashmap` is incremented. The values of `ans`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and the structure of `hashmap` are preserved as per the initial conditions provided.
