Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `hashmap` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `hashmap`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `arrC`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
