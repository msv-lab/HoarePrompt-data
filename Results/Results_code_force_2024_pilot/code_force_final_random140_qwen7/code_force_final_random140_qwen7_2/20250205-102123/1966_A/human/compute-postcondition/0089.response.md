Output State: **`hashmap` contains the key `i` with the value `1`, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is not in `hashmap` (this condition is no longer true).**

Explanation: The code `hashmap[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `hashmap`. This changes the state of `hashmap` such that it now contains the key `i` with the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
