Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `hashmap` is a dictionary with the key `i` having its value incremented by 1, `ans` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `hashmap[i]` by 1. Since `i` was already a key in `hashmap`, its corresponding value is now increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
