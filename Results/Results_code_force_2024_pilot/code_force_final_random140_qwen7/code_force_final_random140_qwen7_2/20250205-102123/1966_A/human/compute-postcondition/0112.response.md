Output State: `ans` is `k - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents an integer from `arrC` and its frequency count. After all iterations of the loop, every integer `i` in `arrC` that was encountered has had its count incremented in `hashmap` until `hashmap[i]` reaches a value less than `k` (since `ans` is never updated to a value other than `k - 1` once it is set). The loop continues until all elements in `arrC` have been processed, and no further updates to `ans` occur.
