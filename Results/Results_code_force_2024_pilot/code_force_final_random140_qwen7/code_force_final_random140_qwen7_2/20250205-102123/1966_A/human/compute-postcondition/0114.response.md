Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is set to `k - 1`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
- `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents an integer from `arrC` and its frequency count, respectively. After processing, the frequency of each integer `i` in `hashmap` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `arrC`.

The loop will iterate over the elements of `arrC`, updating the frequency counts in `hashmap`. If any integer's frequency in `hashmap` reaches or exceeds `k`, `ans` would be updated to `k - 1`. However, the precondition explicitly states that no integer in `arrC` reaches a frequency of `k` during the loop iterations.

Therefore, the value of `ans` remains `k - 1`.

Output: **k - 1**
