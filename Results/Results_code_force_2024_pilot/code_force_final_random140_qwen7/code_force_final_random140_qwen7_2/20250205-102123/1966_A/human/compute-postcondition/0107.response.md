Output State: **`ans` is `k - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element (now missing the first element), `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of the next `i` in `arrC` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `hashmap[i] = 1` sets the value of `hashmap[i]` to 1. Since `i` is the next element in `arrC`, the value of `hashmap[i]` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
