Output State: **`ans` is `k - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element (now missing the first element), `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of the next `i` in `arrC` is incremented by 1 if it exists, or added with the value `1` if it does not exist, and the value of `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1 for the next `i` in `arrC` if `i` is in `hashmap`, otherwise the value of `hashmap[i]` is set to `1`. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged; otherwise, the value of `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `hashmap[i] += 1` increments the value of `hashmap[i]` by 1. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, the output state includes the updated value of `hashmap[i]` which is now one more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
