Postcondition: `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `arrC`, `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `hashmap`, and set to 1 if `i` was not in `hashmap`. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `k - 1`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
