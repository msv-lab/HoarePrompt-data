Output State: `ans` is `k - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents an integer from `arrC` and its frequency count, respectively. After all iterations of the loop, the value of `hashmap[i]` for any integer `i` in `arrC` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `arrC`. If the frequency of any integer `i` in `hashmap` becomes greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `ans` remains `k - 1`; otherwise, `ans` remains `k - 1` as no integer in `arrC` reaches a frequency of `k` during the loop iterations.
