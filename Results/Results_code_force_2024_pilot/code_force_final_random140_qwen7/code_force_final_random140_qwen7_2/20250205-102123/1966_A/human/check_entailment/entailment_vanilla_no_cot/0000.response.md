Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Updating `ans`:**
   - The logic in the program updates `ans` to `k - 1` as soon as any number appears `k` or more times in the array. However, the goal is to minimize the number of cards left, not just to find the first number that meets the condition.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     5 3
     4 1 1 4 4
     ```
     The program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `2` because we can exchange three `4`s to get two cards, and the remaining `1`s cannot be reduced further using the given operation.

2. **Handling Multiple Numbers:**
   - The program does not handle multiple numbers correctly. It only checks for the first number that appears `k` or more times and sets `ans` to `k - 1`. This approach fails when there are multiple numbers that meet the condition, and we need to consider the overall minimization of cards.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to count the occurrences of each number and then determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further. Specifically, for each unique number, if its count is divisible by `k`, we can reduce it to `k - 1`. If not, we keep the remainder as the number of cards that cannot be further reduced.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        arrC = list(map(int, input().split()))
        hashmap = {}
        
        # Count the occurrences of each number
        for i in arrC:
            if i in hashmap:
                hashmap[i] += 1
            else:
                hashmap[i] = 1
        
        ans = 0
        for count in hashmap.values():
            # Calculate the remainder when count is divided by k
            ans += count % k
        
        print(ans)
        t -= 1

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that we correctly calculate the minimum number of cards that cannot be further reduced, providing the right solution to the problem.
