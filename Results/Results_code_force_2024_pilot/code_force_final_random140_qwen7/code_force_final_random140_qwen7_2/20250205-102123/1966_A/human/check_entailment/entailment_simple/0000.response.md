Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of integers `arrC` representing the numbers on the cards.
3. It initializes a dictionary `hashmap` to count occurrences of each number in `arrC`.
4. It iterates through `arrC`, updating the count of each number in `hashmap` and checking if any number appears at least `k` times.
5. If a number appears at least `k` times, it sets `ans` to `k - 1` because we can reduce the count of that number to `k - 1` by performing the allowed operation.
6. If no number appears at least `k` times, `ans` remains `n`.
7. The program prints `ans` for each test case and then decrements `t` to move to the next test case.
8. The final state of the program matches the expected behavior, as described in the comments.

Given the logic and the steps followed, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
