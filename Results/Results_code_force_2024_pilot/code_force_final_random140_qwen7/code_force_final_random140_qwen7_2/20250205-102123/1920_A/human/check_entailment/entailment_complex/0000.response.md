Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and processes each constraint using `func_7`.
- `func_7` correctly initializes `start` and `end` to handle constraints of type 1 and 2.
- Constraints of type 3 are stored in the list `num`.
- The logic in `func_7` correctly updates `start` and `end` based on constraints of type 1 and 2.
- It then counts the number of elements in `num` that do not fall within the range `[start, end]`.
- Finally, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints by subtracting the count of invalid numbers from the total range length `[start, end]`.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation of each function, the overall program logic is correct. All necessary steps are taken to ensure that the constraints are properly handled and the final count is accurate.

Correctness: **True**
