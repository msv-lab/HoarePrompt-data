Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

# Annotated Functions:
import math
import re

n = func_1()
ans = []
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
for i in range(n):
    ans.append(func_7())
for i in ans:
    print(i)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to return an integer input or 1. If isOne is False, then the function returns an integer input; otherwise, it returns 1.
def func_1(isOne):
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns 1
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1 since isOne is True and the function returns 1 when isOne is True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it prompts the user to enter an integer and returns that integer. If `isOne` is `True`, it simply returns the value `1`. In both cases, the function concludes by returning either the user-input integer or `1`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of multiple lines as described in the problem statement. Each test case starts with an integer n followed by n lines describing the constraints. Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `line` is either an integer n converted to a list of characters or the first input line split on spaces into a list of strings (`items`), depending on whether `space` is True or False.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers converted from the strings in `items`
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns `items`, which is either an integer `n` converted to a list of characters or the first input line split on spaces into a list of strings, depending on the value of `space`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `space` (a boolean) and `to_int` (a string or list of strings). Depending on the value of `space`, it either splits the input string on spaces into a list of strings or converts the string into a list of characters. If `to_int` is set to `True`, it converts the elements of the list to integers and returns them. Otherwise, it returns the list as is.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and sym is a string representing the separator between the integers when converting the list to a string.
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least three elements, `i` will take the value of each element in `arr` in sequence, converted to a string and concatenated with `sym`, and `string` is the concatenation of all elements in `arr` (each converted to a string and separated by `sym`).
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `string` will be a single string where all elements from the list `arr` are concatenated together, with each element converted to a string and separated by the `sym` separator.
    return string
    #The program returns a single string where all elements from the list `arr` are concatenated together, with each element converted to a string and separated by the `sym` separator.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It concatenates all elements of `arr`, converting each integer to a string and inserting `sym` between them. The function returns a single string resulting from this concatenation.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string, substring is a string such that substring is not empty and is a valid substring of string.
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `string` is a string, `substring` is a string such that `substring` is not empty and is a valid substring of `string`, `indices` is a list containing all the indices of occurrences of `substring` in `string`, and `index` is -1 since the loop terminates when `index` becomes -1.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `indices` will contain every index where `substring` occurs in `string`, starting from the first occurrence and moving through the string one character at a time until no more occurrences of `substring` are found. The variable `index` will be set to -1, indicating that no further occurrences were found.
    return indices
    #`indices` is a list containing all the indices of occurrences of `substring` in `string`, and `index` is -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `string` (a string) and `substring` (a non-empty string that is a valid substring of `string`). It returns a list containing all the indices where `substring` occurs within `string`, or an empty list if no occurrences are found. After executing, the function ensures that the list `indices` contains all positions where `substring` is found in `string`, and the variable `index` is set to -1, indicating the end of the search.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and element is an integer that exists within the list arr.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #A list of indices where the integer 'element' exists within the list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `element`. It searches through the list `arr` and returns a list of indices where the integer `element` is found.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers. index is an integer such that 0 <= index < len(subArray) for all subArrays in arr. value is an integer.
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: Output State: The function returns a sublist from `arr` where the element at index `index` is not equal to `value`. If no such sublist exists, the function returns None.
    #
    #This output state means that after the loop has executed as many times as there are subarrays in `arr`, the function will return the first sublist it encounters where the element at position `index` is not equal to `value`. If the loop completes without finding any such sublist, the function will return `None`.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes a list of lists `arr`, an integer index, and an integer value as inputs. It searches through each sublist in `arr` to find the first sublist where the element at the specified `index` is not equal to `value`. If such a sublist is found, it is returned; otherwise, the function returns `None`.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and for each constraint, t is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (t, x) are distinct.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` integers have been processed. For each integer `v` provided, if `t` is 1, `start` is updated to be the minimum value between `start` and `v`. If `t` is 2, `end` is updated to be the maximum value between `end` and `v`. If `t` is 3, `v` is appended to the list `num`. The variables `t` and `v` are reset to their initial values at the start of each iteration, and `i` increments with each iteration.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Postcondition: `count_num` is equal to the total number of elements in the list `num` that fall within the range defined by `start` and `end`.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of constraints involving integers and updates two variables, `start` and `end`, based on these constraints. It also collects integers into a list `num`. After processing, it counts how many integers in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. Finally, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus the count of integers within the range, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns `0`.
