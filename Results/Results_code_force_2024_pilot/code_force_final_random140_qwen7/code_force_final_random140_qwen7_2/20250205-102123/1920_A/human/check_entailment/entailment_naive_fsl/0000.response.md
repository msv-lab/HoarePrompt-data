Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and calculate the valid range for `k`. Specifically, the logic for updating `start` and `end` is flawed. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The initial values for `start` and `end` are set to `-1` and `1000000000.0`, respectively. This means that any valid constraint will overwrite these values, but the initial values should be more meaningful.

2. **Constraint Handling**:
   - For `t == 1`, the program updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
   - For `t == 2`, the program updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.

3. **Exclusion of Specific Values**:
   - The program correctly excludes specific values (`num.append(v)`) but does not handle the case where these excluded values overlap with the range `[start, end]`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final calculation `return end - start + 1 - count_num` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the overlap between the excluded values and the range `[start, end]`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Consider the following input:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```

- Constraints:
  - `k >= 3`
  - `k <= 10`
  - `k != 1`
  - `k != 5`

- The program should correctly identify that `k` can be `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`, resulting in 7 valid values.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the range and excludes the wrong values, leading to an incorrect result.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, you should:
1. Initialize `start` to the maximum value from all constraints of type 1.
2. Initialize `end` to the minimum value from all constraints of type 2.
3. Remove the excluded values from the range `[start, end]`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = float('inf')
    end = -float('inf')
    excluded_values = set()

    for _ in range(n):
        t, v = map(int, input().split())
        if t == 1:
            start = min(start, v)
        elif t == 2:
            end = max(end, v)
        elif t == 3:
            excluded_values.add(v)

    # Calculate the valid range
    valid_range = max(0, end - start + 1 - len(excluded_values & set(range(start, end + 1))))
    return valid_range
```

This corrected function initializes `start` and `end` appropriately and correctly handles the exclusion of specific values within the range.
