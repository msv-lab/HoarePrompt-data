Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. Constraints are of three types:
   - `k >= x`
   - `k <= x`
   - `k != x`

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`) but does not use them in the main function `func_7`.
   - The main function `func_7` correctly initializes variables `start` and `end` to represent the range of valid `k` values.
   - It iterates over the constraints and updates `start` and `end` accordingly.
   - For constraints of type 3 (`k != x`), it checks if `x` falls within the current range `[start, end]`. If it does, it increments `count_num`.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic to update `start` and `end` based on constraints of type 1 and 2 is correct.
   - The logic to handle constraints of type 3 is also correct. It ensures that any `x` that falls within the current range `[start, end]` is excluded from the count.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the edge case where `start` is greater than `end`, returning 0 as expected.

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The final result is calculated as `end - start + 1 - count_num`, which correctly accounts for the number of valid `k` values after excluding those that do not satisfy the constraints of type 3.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
