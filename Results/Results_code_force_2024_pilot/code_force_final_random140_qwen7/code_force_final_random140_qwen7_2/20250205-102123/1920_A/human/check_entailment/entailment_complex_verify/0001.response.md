### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints. Constraints are of three types:
     - \( k \geq x \)
     - \( k \leq x \)
     - \( k \neq x \)

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`), but they are not used in the main function `func_7`.
   - The main function `func_7` correctly initializes variables `start` and `end` to represent the range of valid \( k \) values.
   - It iterates over the constraints and updates `start` and `end` accordingly.
   - For constraints of type 3 (`k \neq x`), it checks if \( x \) falls within the current range \([start, end]\). If it does, it increments `count_num`.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic to update `start` and `end` based on constraints of type 1 and 2 is correct.
   - The logic to handle constraints of type 3 is also correct. It ensures that any \( x \) that falls within the current range \([start, end]\) is excluded from the count.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the edge case where `start` is greater than `end`, returning 0 as expected.

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The final result is calculated as `end - start + 1 - count_num`, which correctly accounts for the number of valid \( k \) values after excluding those that do not satisfy the constraints of type 3.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the original assessment, there is a subtle issue in the handling of constraints of type 3. Specifically, the function `func_7` does not correctly account for the exclusion of elements in the range \([start, end]\) that are not equal to \( x \).

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Constraint Handling**:
  - When processing constraints of type 3 (`k \neq x`), the function should exclude all \( x \) that fall within the current range \([start, end]\). However, the current implementation only increments `count_num` if \( x \) falls within \([start, end]\). This means that if \( x \) is outside the range, it is not counted, which is incorrect.

- **Correct Approach**:
  - To correctly handle constraints of type 3, the function should exclude all \( x \) that fall within the range \([start, end]\) by decrementing the count of valid \( k \) values.

### Corrected Implementation:

```python
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    # Exclude all x that fall within the range [start, end]
    for x in num:
        if start <= x <= end:
            count_num -= 1  # Decrement count_num if x is within the range
    
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
```

### Final Evaluation:

- **Original Assessment**:
  - The original assessment correctly identified the logic and edge cases but missed the critical detail in handling constraints of type 3.

- **Corrected Implementation**:
  - The corrected implementation ensures that all \( x \) within the range \([start, end]\) are excluded from the count.

- **Conclusion**:
  - Given the corrected implementation, the original assessment was slightly inaccurate due to the oversight in handling constraints of type 3.

**Final: False**
