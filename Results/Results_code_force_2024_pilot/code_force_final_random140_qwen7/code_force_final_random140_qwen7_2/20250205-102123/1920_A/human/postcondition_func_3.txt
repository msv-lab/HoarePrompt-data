The function accepts two parameters: `string` (a string) and `substring` (a non-empty string that is a valid substring of `string`). It returns a list containing all the indices where `substring` occurs within `string`, or an empty list if no occurrences are found. After executing, the function ensures that the list `indices` contains all positions where `substring` is found in `string`, and the variable `index` is set to -1, indicating the end of the search.
