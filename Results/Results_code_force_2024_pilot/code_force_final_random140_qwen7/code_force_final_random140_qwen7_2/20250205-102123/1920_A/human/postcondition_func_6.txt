The function processes a series of constraints involving integers and updates two variables, `start` and `end`, based on these constraints. It also collects integers into a list `num`. After processing, it counts how many integers in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. Finally, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus the count of integers within the range, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns `0`.
