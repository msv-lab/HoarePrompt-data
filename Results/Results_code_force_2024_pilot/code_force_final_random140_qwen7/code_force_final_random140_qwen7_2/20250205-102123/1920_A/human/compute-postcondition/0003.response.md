Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `t` is an integer in {1, 2, 3}, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `num`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `x`, `start`, or `end`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values.
