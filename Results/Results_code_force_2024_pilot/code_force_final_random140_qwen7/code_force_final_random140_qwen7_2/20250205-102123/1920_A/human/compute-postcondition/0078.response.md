Postcondition: `count_num` is either 2 or 3, depending on whether `i` (which is the third element in the list `num`) is within the range defined by `start` and `end`. If `i` is outside this range, the loop continues with `count_num` remaining 2. If `i` is within the range, `count_num` is incremented to 3.
