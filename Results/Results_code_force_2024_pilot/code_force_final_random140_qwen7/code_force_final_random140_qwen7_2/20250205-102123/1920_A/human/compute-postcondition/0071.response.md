Output State: **`count_num` is 2, `i` is the second element in the list `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `count_num` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The value of `i` remains the second element in the list `num`, as the code does not alter `i`. The precondition that `num` must have at least two elements is still valid.
