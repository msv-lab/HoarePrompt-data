Output State: **`t` is 1, `v` is an integer input split and mapped to integers, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` is now the first integer from the input, and `v` is now the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `t` and `v` respectively. The initial value of `t` remains 1, and `v` is updated to the second integer from the input. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
