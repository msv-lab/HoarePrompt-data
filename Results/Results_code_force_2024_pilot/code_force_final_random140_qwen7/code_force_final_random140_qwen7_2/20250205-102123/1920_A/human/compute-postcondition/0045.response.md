Output State: **`t` is 1, `v` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `start` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The line `start = v` assigns the value of `v` to the variable `start`. Since `v` is the second integer from the input, `start` now holds this value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
