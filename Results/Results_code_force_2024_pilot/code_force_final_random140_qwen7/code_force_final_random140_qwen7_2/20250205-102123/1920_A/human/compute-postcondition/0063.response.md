Output State: **`count_num` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `num`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to `count_num` or `i`, their values remain the same. The precondition that `i` is the first element in the list `num` and does not satisfy the condition `start <= i <= end` remains valid for the next iteration.
