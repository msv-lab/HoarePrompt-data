State: **`count_num` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `num`, `num` must have at least one element**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the iterable `num`.
2. For the loop to execute, `num` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `num`.
3. The variable `i` will take on the value of each element in `num` during each iteration of the loop.
4. Since `count_num` is initialized to 0 and its value is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `num` (must have at least one element) and `i` (which will be set to the first element of `num` at the start of the loop).
