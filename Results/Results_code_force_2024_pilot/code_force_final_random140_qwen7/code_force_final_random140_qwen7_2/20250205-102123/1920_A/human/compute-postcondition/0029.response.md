Output State: **`t` is 1, `v` is an integer input split and mapped to integers, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns them to `t` and `v`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as 1. The initial value of `i` and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remain unchanged. The value of `v` is updated to the integer value of the first input split and mapped.
