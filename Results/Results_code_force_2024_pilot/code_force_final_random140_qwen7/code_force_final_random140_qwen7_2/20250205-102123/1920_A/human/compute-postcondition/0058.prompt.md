Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `t` is an integer in {1, 2, 3}, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if t == 1:
        if start < v:
            start = v
    if t == 2:
        if end > v:
            end = v
    if t == 3:
        num.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is 1 and `v` is an integer assigned from input split and mapped to integers. The postcondition does not change regardless of whether the condition `t == 3` is met because there is no modification to the variables `t` or `v` within the if block, and the else part is non-existent.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is 1, `v` is an integer input split and mapped to integers, `i` is 1, and if `end` is greater than `v`, `end` is set to `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is 1, `v` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `start` is the second integer from the input, and `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input, regardless of whether `t` equals 3 or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
