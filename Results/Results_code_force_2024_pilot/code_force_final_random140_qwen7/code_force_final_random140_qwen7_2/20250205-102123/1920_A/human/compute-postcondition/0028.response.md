The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust those variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since there is no information about the initial values of `i` and `n` provided in the problem statement, we assume they are as follows:

- `i` starts from 0.
- `n` is some positive integer.

At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is not modified in the loop, it remains the same as its initial value.

Given the postcondition does not change regardless of whether the condition `t == 3` is met, we can infer that `n` is not dependent on `t` or `v`.

State: **`t` is 1, `v` is an integer assigned from input split and mapped to integers, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
