Output State: **`t` is 1, `v` is an integer assigned from input split and mapped to integers, `end` is equal to `v`.**

The code `end = v` assigns the value of `v` to `end`. Since `v` is an integer assigned from input split and mapped to integers, `end` now holds the same value as `v`. The value of `t` remains unchanged at 1, and the condition that `end` is greater than `v` is no longer applicable since `end` is now equal to `v`.
