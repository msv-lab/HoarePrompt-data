Output State: **`t` is 1, `v` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `start` is the second integer from the input, `end` is `v`.**

The code assigns the value of `v` to `end`, which means `end` now holds the value of `v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
