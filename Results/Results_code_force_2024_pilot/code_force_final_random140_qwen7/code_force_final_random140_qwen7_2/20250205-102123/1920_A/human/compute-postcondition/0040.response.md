Output State: **`t` is 1, `v` is an integer input split and mapped to integers, `i` is 1, `num` is a list with one element which is `v`.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `v` is an integer input split and mapped to integers, it gets added to the list. The values of `t`, `i`, and `end` remain unchanged as per the conditions given.
