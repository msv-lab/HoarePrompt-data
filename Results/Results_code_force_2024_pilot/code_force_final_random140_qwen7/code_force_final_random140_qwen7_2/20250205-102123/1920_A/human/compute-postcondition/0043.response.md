Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 1
   - `v` is an integer input split and mapped to integers
   - `i` is 1
   - If `end` is greater than `v`, `end` is set to `v`

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(n)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state based on the loop condition**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` remains 1.
   - `v` remains an integer input split and mapped to integers.
   - `i` is updated to 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is 1, `v` is an integer input split and mapped to integers, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
