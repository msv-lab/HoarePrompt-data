Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Current States**:
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.
   - `t` is an integer in {1, 2, 3}.
   - `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
   - `start` is -1.
   - `end` is 1000000000.
   - `num` is an empty list.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Given that `n` is already between 2 and 100, it satisfies this condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be at least 1 (which it already is).
- `i` should be set to 0 (the initial value).

Since `i` is the only variable that needs to be explicitly set, and `n` already meets the requirement, we can summarize the necessary adjustments.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1**
