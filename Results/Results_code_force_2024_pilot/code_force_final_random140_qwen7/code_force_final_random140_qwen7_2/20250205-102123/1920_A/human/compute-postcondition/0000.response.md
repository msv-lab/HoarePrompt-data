Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `t` is an integer in {1, 2, 3}, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (t, x) are distinct. After executing `n = int(input())`, `n` is now set to the integer input received, while `t` and `x` remain unchanged.**

This means that the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input provided by the user, but the values of `t` and `x` remain as they were in the initial state since no input was given for them.
