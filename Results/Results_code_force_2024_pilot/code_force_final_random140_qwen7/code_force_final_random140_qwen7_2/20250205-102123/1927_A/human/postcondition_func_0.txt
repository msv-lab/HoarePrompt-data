The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then reads a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. It finds the positions of the first and last 'B' characters in the string `s` and prints the distance between these two positions. If the string `s` does not contain any 'B' characters, it prints 0.
