Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of characters from the new input string, `start` is the index of 'B' in `x`, `end` is the length of `x` minus one minus the index of 'B' in the reversed list `x`**.

Explanation: The code `end = len(x) - x[::-1].index('B') - 1` finds the index of 'B' in the reversed list `x` and calculates `end` as the length of `x` minus one minus this index. The values of `t`, `i`, `x`, and `start` remain unchanged.
