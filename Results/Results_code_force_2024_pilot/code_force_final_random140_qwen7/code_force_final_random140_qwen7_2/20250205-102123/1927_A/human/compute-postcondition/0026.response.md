To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `i` is set to 2.
   - `x` is a list of characters from a new input string.
   - `start` is the index of 'B' in the list `x`.
   - `end` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the reversed list `x`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(end - start)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The value of `end` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the reversed list `x`.
   - The value of `start` is the index of 'B' in the original list `x`.
   - The expression `end - start` calculates the distance between these two indices.

4. **Output**:
   - Since `end` and `start` are both indices of the character 'B', their difference will give us the number of characters between the first and last 'B' in the list `x`.

Given this analysis, the output will be the difference between the index of the last 'B' in the reversed list and the index of the first 'B' in the original list.

Output: **end - start (where end is the index of the last 'B' in the reversed list x and start is the index of the first 'B' in the original list x)**
