Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of characters from the input string, `start` is the index of 'B' in the list `x`.**

The code `start = x.index('B')` finds the index of the character 'B' in the list `x` and assigns it to the variable `start`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
