Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10; s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in s is 'B'.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the condition for `s` also remains the same.
