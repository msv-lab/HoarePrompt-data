Output State: **Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is a list of characters from the final input string. If 'B' is found in the list `x`, `start` is the index of the first 'B' and `end` is the index of the last 'B' in the reversed list `x`. If 'B' is not found in the list `x`, no additional variables are modified.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n`. The variables `t` and `s` (which was not involved in the loop) remain as they were initially. For each iteration, `t` was updated based on user input, and `x` was updated to be the list of characters from the corresponding input string. If 'B' was present in any of these lists, `start` and `end` were calculated accordingly. If 'B' was not present, these variables remained unchanged.
