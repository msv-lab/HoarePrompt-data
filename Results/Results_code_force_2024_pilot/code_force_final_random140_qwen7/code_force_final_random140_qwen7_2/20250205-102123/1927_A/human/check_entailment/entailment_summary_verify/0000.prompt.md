You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Example

Input

    8
    
    6
    
    WBBWBW
    
    1
    
    B
    
    2
    
    WB
    
    3
    
    BBW
    
    4
    
    BWWB
    
    6
    
    BWBWWB
    
    6
    
    WWBBWB
    
    9
    
    WBWBWWWBW

Output

    4
    1
    1
    2
    4
    6
    4
    7
    
Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        t = int(input())
        x = list(input())
        if 'B' in x:
            start = x.index('B')
            end = len(x) - x[::-1].index('B') - 1
            print(end - start)
        else:
            print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then reads a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. It finds the positions of the first and last 'B' characters in the string `s` and prints the distance between these two positions. If the string `s` does not contain any 'B' characters, it prints 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the black cell ('B') appears more than once in the strip. For example, consider the input:

```
6
BWBWWB
```

The expected output is `4`, but the program will incorrectly output `2` because it only considers the first occurrence of 'B' and the last occurrence of 'B' without checking the entire strip. This leads to an incorrect result for this and similar cases.
