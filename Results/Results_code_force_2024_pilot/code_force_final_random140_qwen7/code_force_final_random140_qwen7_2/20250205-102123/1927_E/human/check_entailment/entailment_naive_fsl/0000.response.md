Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all potential cases. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 4`, `k = 2`

Expected output: A permutation like `[1, 2, 3, 4]` or `[4, 3, 2, 1]` would be valid since the sums of continuous segments of length 2 are either `3` or `5`, satisfying the condition.

However, the current implementation might produce something like `[1, 4, 2, 3]`. Let's check the sums:
- Sum of segment `[1, 4]`: `1 + 4 = 5`
- Sum of segment `[4, 2]`: `4 + 2 = 6`
- Sum of segment `[2, 3]`: `2 + 3 = 5`

Here, the maximum sum is `6` and the minimum sum is `5`, so the difference is `1`, which seems to satisfy the condition. However, this is a specific case. The issue arises when we consider the placement of values in the array.

For instance, if we take the permutation `[1, 4, 2, 3]` and calculate the sums of continuous segments of length 2:
- Sum of segment `[1, 4]`: `1 + 4 = 5`
- Sum of segment `[4, 2]`: `4 + 2 = 6`
- Sum of segment `[2, 3]`: `2 + 3 = 5`

This permutation does not guarantee that the sums of continuous segments of length 2 will always differ by no more than 1. Therefore, the program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
