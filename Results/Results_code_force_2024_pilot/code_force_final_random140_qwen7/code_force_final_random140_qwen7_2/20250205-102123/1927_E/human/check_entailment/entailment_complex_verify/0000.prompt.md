You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input, where \( 2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k \) is even. It then constructs a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) following a specific pattern and prints the permutation as a space-separated string. The final state of the program is that the constructed permutation is printed to the standard output.

#Function 2:

    #State: Output State: `t` is equal to 0.
    #
    #Natural Language Description: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be equal to 0, as it is decremented by 1 in each iteration and starts from a positive integer value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even), calls another function `func_1()` to perform some operations, and then decrements `t` by 1. After processing all test cases, it ensures that `t` is equal to 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all potential cases. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 4`, `k = 2`

Expected output: A permutation like `[1, 2, 3, 4]` or `[4, 3, 2, 1]` would be valid since the sums of continuous segments of length 2 are either `3` or `5`, satisfying the condition.

However, the current implementation might produce something like `[1, 4, 2, 3]`. Let's check the sums:
- Sum of segment `[1, 4]`: `1 + 4 = 5`
- Sum of segment `[4, 2]`: `4 + 2 = 6`
- Sum of segment `[2, 3]`: `2 + 3 = 5`

Here, the maximum sum is `6` and the minimum sum is `5`, so the difference is `1`, which seems to satisfy the condition. However, this is a specific case. The issue arises when we consider the placement of values in the array.

For instance, if we take the permutation `[1, 4, 2, 3]` and calculate the sums of continuous segments of length 2:
- Sum of segment `[1, 4]`: `1 + 4 = 5`
- Sum of segment `[4, 2]`: `4 + 2 = 6`
- Sum of segment `[2, 3]`: `2 + 3 = 5`

This permutation does not guarantee that the sums of continuous segments of length 2 will always differ by no more than 1. Therefore, the program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
