### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `permutation` is initialized as a list of zeros of length `n`.
   - `bottom_v` is set to 1 (smallest value).
   - `top_v` is set to `n` (largest value).

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs from `idx = 0` to `idx < k`.
   - For each `idx`, the inner loop sets values in the `permutation` list at positions `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and increments/decrements `bottom_v` and `top_v` accordingly.
   - The `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is incremented by `k` in each iteration of the inner loop.

3. **Pattern Explanation**:
   - For even `idx`, the smallest remaining value (`bottom_v`) is assigned.
   - For odd `idx`, the largest remaining value (`top_v`) is assigned.
   - This pattern ensures that the smallest and largest values are distributed evenly across the permutation.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Given the alternating pattern, the sums of any `k` consecutive elements will be close to each other because the smallest and largest values are balanced.
   - Since `k` is even, the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any `k` consecutive elements will be at most 1.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` and then decrementing `t`.

2. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, `t` will be 0, ensuring that all permutations are generated and printed.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Initialization and Iteration**:
   - The initialization of `bottom_v` and `top_v` ensures that the smallest and largest values are used alternately.
   - The loop structure ensures that every `k`-length segment of the permutation will have a mix of small and large values, which helps in maintaining the condition that any two sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The constructed permutation ensures that the sums of any `k` consecutive elements will be close to each other because the smallest and largest values are distributed evenly across the permutation.
   - Given that `k` is even and the values are alternated between the smallest and largest available values, the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any `k` consecutive elements will be at most 1.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that `k` is even and `k <= n`, so the logic should work for all valid inputs within the constraints.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the provided program correctly constructs a k-level permutation according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
