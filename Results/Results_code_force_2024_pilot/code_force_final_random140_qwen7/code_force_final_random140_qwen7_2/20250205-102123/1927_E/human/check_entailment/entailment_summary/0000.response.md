Reasoning:
- The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where a k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length k is at most 1.
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` handles multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each one.
- `func_1` constructs a permutation of length n using a specific pattern. It alternates between increasing and decreasing values, starting from 1 and ending at n.
- Given that k is even and the construction pattern alternates between the smallest and largest remaining values, it ensures that the sums of any k consecutive elements will be close to each other, meeting the k-level permutation requirement.

Given these points, let's verify if the construction pattern in `func_1` meets the k-level permutation criteria:
- The pattern starts from 1 and increases, then decreases, ensuring that the sums of any k consecutive elements will be balanced around the average value.
- Since k is even, the alternating pattern will distribute the values evenly across the range, minimizing the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any k consecutive elements.

Therefore, the provided implementation should correctly generate a k-level permutation for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
