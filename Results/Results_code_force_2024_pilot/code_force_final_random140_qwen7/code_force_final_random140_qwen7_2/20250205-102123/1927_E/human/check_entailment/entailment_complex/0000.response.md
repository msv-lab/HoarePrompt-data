Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**: This function correctly constructs a permutation of length `n` based on the given constraints. It initializes an array `permutation` of size `n` with zeros. Then, it uses a nested loop to fill the array in a specific pattern:
   - For even indices `idx`, it assigns the smallest available value (`bottom_v`).
   - For odd indices `idx`, it assigns the largest available value (`top_v`).
   - It increments `bottom_v` and decrements `top_v` after each assignment.
   - The outer loop runs `k` times, ensuring that the pattern is applied over the entire array in segments of length `k`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case. After processing all test cases, it ensures that `t` is decremented until it reaches zero.

3. **Permutation Validity**: The constructed permutation in `func_1()` follows the required pattern and uses all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once. The pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by at most 1, making the permutation `k-level`.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided examples demonstrate that the function works correctly for various values of `n` and `k`. The permutations generated satisfy the conditions of being `k-level`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution for constructing a `k-level` permutation for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
