Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even, and returns information based on these inputs.**

This means the function will handle multiple test cases (specified by `t`), and for each test case, it will accept two integers `n` and `k`. The function will check if `k` is within the specified range and is even, and then perform some operation based on these values, though the exact operation is not detailed here.
