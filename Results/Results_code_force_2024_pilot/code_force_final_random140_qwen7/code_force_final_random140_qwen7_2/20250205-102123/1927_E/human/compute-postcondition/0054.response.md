Output State: **`idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 2 * k + 1`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + 2 * k + 1`; regardless of whether `idx` is even or odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `top_v - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. Given the initial state where `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was equal to `idx + k + 1`, after the increment, its new value becomes `idx + 2 * k + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
