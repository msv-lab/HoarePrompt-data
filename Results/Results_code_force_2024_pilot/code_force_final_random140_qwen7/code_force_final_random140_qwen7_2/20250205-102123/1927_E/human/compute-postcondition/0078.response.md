Output State: **`idx` is `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is incremented by `k`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `nk + n + k - 2`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced with `bottom_v + 1`; if `idx` is odd, `top_v` is set to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `idx` remains `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now `k + k = 2k`, and the other conditions related to `permutation`, `bottom_v`, and `top_v` remain as specified in the initial state.
