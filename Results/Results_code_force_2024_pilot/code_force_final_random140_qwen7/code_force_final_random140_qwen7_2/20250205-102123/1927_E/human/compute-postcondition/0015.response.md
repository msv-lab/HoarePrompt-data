Output State: **`permutation` is a list of n zeros, `n` and `k` are integers with 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k being even, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is n, `permutation[0]` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is k, `idx` is not even.**

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was initially set to 0 (as per the initial conditions when `idx` is not even), adding `k` to it results in `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` becoming `k`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
