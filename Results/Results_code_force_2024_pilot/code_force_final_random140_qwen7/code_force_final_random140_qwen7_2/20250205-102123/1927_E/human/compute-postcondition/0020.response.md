Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with `permutation[k]` set to `n`, `n` and `k` are integers with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` being even, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `n-1`, `permutation[0]` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`, `idx` is not even.**

Explanation: The code `top_v -= 1` decrements the value of `top_v` by 1. Since `top_v` was initially set to `n`, after executing this line, `top_v` becomes `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
