Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than its initial value by 1**

Explanation: The initial state is that `t` must be greater than 0. The code `t -= 1` decrements `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing by 1, `t` is still a positive integer but now it is exactly 1 less than its initial value.
