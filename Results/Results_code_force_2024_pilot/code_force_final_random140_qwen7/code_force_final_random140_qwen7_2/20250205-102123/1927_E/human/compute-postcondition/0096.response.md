Output State: `idx` is `k + 6`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `3k`, and `permutation` is updated such that for each index `i` where `i % k == 0` and `i < len(permutation)`, if `idx % 2 == 0`, `permutation[i]` is replaced with `bottom_v + (idx // 2)`, and if `idx % 2 != 0`, `permutation[i]` is replaced with `top_v - (idx // 2)`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `idx` will have incremented by 6 (since it increments by 2 each iteration as per the loop condition `idx % 2 == 0` and `idx % 2 != 0` alternating), `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be equal to `3k` (as it increments by `k` each iteration), and the `permutation` list will have its elements updated based on the values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` according to the specified conditions.
