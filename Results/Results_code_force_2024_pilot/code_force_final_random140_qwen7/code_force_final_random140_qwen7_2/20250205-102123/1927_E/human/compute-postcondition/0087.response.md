Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`. This means the loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: The only variable in the loop head that affects the loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. Therefore, we need to adjust this variable to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

3. **Current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been incremented by `k`. For the loop to continue, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than the length of `permutation`.

4. **Adjustment required**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was incremented by `k` in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that after this increment, it still satisfies the loop condition.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`**
