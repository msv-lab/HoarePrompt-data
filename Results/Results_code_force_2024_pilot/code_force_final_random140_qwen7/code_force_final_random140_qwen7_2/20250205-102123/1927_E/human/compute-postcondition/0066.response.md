Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `idx` is less than `k` and equals `idx + 1`: This implies that `idx` is exactly one less than `k`. Therefore, `idx = k - 1`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + n * k + (n - 1)`: Given `idx = k - 1`, this becomes `multiples_of_k_plus_idx = (k - 1) + n * k + (n - 1) = k - 1 + nk + n - 1 = nk + n + k - 2`.
- `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`: This means `len(permutation) > nk + n + k - 2`.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `idx < k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must be less than `k` after the current iteration. Since `idx` starts as `k - 1`, the next value of `idx` would be `k`.

### Adjusting States
- The only variable in the loop head is `idx`, so we need to adjust `idx` to `k`.
- We don't need to adjust `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` because it is derived from `idx` and `n`, and these values remain unchanged until the next iteration.
- `len(permutation)` remains unchanged as well since the loop body does not affect the length of `permutation`.

### Final State
State: **`idx` is `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `nk + n + k - 2`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `nk + n + k - 2`**.
