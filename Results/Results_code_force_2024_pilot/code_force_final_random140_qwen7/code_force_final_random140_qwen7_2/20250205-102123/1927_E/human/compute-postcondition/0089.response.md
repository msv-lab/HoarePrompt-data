Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced with `bottom_v + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. The state of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `permutation` remains the same as per the initial state, but `bottom_v` is now updated to `bottom_v + 1`.
