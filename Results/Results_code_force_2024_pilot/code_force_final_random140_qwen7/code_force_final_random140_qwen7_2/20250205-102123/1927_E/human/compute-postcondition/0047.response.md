Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.

2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: We need to ensure that the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)` holds true for the next iteration. This means `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` should be incremented by 1 and checked against `len(permutation)`.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `idx` is less than `k`.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + k`.
   - `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + k`.
   - If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v + 1`.
   - If `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is equal to `top_v - 1`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop increments `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by 1, we need to set `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` to `multiples_of_k_plus_idx + 1`.
   - The other conditions (`idx < k`, `len(permutation) > idx + k`) should remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` to `multiples_of_k_plus_idx + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + k + 1`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + k + 1`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v + 1`; if `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is equal to `top_v - 1`.**
