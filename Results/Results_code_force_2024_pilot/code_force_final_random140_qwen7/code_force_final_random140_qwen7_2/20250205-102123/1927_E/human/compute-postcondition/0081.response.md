Output State: **`permutation'` is updated such that the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now equal to `bottom_v + 1`, other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1, and this new value is assigned back to the same position in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
