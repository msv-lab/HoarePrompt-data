Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignment or modification of `t`), the value of `t` remains unchanged. The precondition that `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1` is still valid after the function call.
