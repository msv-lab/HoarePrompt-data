Output State: **`idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 2 * k + 1`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + 2 * k + 1`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `idx` is still less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is still equal to `idx + 2 * k + 1`, `len(permutation)` is still greater than `idx + 2 * k + 1`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to the original value of `bottom_v + 1`.
