Postcondition: `idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 2 * k + 1`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + 2 * k + 1`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v + 1`. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `top_v - 2`.
