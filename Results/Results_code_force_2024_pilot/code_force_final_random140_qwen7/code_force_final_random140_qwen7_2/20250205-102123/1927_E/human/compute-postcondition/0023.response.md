Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `permutation[0]` is 1.
   - `n` and `k` are integers with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` being even.
   - `bottom_v` is either 1 or 3.
   - `top_v` is either `n` or `n-1`.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2k`.
   - `idx` is not even.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is currently `2k`, we need to ensure that `2k < n`.

Since `2k` is the current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, and we know that `k` is even and within the range \(2 \leq k \leq n\), the smallest possible value for `2k` is 4 (when `k = 2`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `2k`.

Thus, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than `2k`.

4. **Final state**:
   - `permutation` remains as a list of `n` zeros.
   - `permutation[0]` remains as 1.
   - `n` must be greater than `2k`.
   - `k` remains as an even integer within the specified range.
   - `bottom_v` remains either 1 or 3.
   - `top_v` remains either `n` or `n-1`.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains `2k`.
   - `idx` remains not even.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `permutation[0]` is 1, `n` must be greater than `2k`, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n`, `bottom_v` is either 1 or 3, `top_v` is either `n` or `n-1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2k`, and `idx` is not even**.
