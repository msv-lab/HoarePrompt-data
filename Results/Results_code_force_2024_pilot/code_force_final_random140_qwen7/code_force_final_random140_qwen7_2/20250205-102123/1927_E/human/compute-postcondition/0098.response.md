Output State: **The `permutation` list is completely filled with all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once, following a specific pattern determined by the loop's logic.**

- The first half of the list (`permutation[0:k]`) contains the smallest `k/2` numbers in ascending order.
- The second half of the list (`permutation[k:n]`) contains the largest `k/2` numbers in descending order.
- This alternating pattern continues throughout the entire list, ensuring that every integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly once.
- The value of `idx` is `k`, as the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The value of `bottom_v` is `n - k/2 + 1`, reflecting the starting point for the smallest remaining numbers.
- The value of `top_v` is `k/2 + 1`, indicating the starting point for the largest remaining numbers.
- The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `n * k + n - 1`, marking the last index that was updated during the loop's execution.
