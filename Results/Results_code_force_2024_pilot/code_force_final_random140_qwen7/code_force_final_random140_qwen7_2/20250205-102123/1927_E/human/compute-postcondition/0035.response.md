Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`. The variables involved here are `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)` must be true.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `idx` is less than `k`.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is currently equal to `idx`, and `idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is also less than `k`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, and `idx` is less than `k`, the critical part is ensuring `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `idx` is less than `k`.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`.
   - `len(permutation)` must be greater than `idx` (which is less than `k`).

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute the first time:

State: **`idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, and `len(permutation)` must be greater than `idx`**
