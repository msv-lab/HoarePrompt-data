Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints, the function does not take any parameters `n` and `k`. The constraints state that `n` and `k` should be integers such that `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even. However, since the function definition shows `def func_1():`, it indicates that the function does not accept any parameters and therefore does not perform any operations based on `n` and `k`. The function's purpose, based on the given information, is simply to exist without accepting or returning any values.
