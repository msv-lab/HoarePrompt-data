Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `permutation[0]` is 1, `permutation[2k]` is `bottom_v`, `n` must be greater than `2k`, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n`, `bottom_v` is now `bottom_v + 1`, `top_v` is either `n` or `n-1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2k`, and `idx` is not even.**

Explanation: The code `bottom_v += 1` increments the value of `bottom_v` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
