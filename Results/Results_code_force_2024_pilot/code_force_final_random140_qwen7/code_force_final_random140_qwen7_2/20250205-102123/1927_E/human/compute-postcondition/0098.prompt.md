Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `permutation` is a list of n zeros, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, and 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even; `bottom_v` is 1; `top_v` is n; `idx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while idx < k:
    multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx
    while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
        if idx % 2 == 0:
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
            bottom_v += 1
        else:
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
            top_v -= 1
        multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k
    idx += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx` is increased by 1, `permutation` list will be filled such that it starts with 1 at index 0, then alternates between increasing values starting from `bottom_v` (which starts at 1) and decreasing values starting from `top_v` (which starts at `n`). After all iterations, `permutation` will contain all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once, in a pattern determined by the loop's logic. Specifically, the first half of the list (`permutation[0:k]`) will contain the smallest `k/2` numbers in ascending order, and the second half (`permutation[k:n]`) will contain the largest `k/2` numbers in descending order. This pattern will repeat until all elements of `permutation` are filled. The `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `bottom_v` will be `n - k/2 + 1` and the `top_v` will be `k/2 + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `idx` is less than `k` and equals `idx + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + n * k + (n - 1)`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + n * k + (n - 1)`, where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v + (1 - n)`. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `top_v - n`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `idx` is `k + 7`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `3k`, and `permutation` is updated such that for each index `i` where `i % k == 0` and `i < len(permutation)`, if `idx % 2 == 0`, `permutation[i]` is replaced with `bottom_v + (idx // 2)`, and if `idx % 2 != 0`, `permutation[i]` is replaced with `top_v - (idx // 2)`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
