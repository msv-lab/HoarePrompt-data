Output State: **`idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 2 * k + 1`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `top_v - 1`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + 2 * k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` to `top_v - 1`. The values of `idx`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, and `len(permutation)` remain unchanged from their initial states.
