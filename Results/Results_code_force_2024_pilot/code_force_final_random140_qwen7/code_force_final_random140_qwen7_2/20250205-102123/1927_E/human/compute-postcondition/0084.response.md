Postcondition: `permutation` is updated such that if `idx % 2 == 0`, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated to `bottom_v + 1`, and if `idx % 2 != 0`, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated to `top_v - 1`. All other elements in `permutation` and the values of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `top_v` remain unchanged.
