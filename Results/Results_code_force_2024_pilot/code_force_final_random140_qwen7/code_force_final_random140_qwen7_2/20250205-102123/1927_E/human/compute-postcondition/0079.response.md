To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop head, which is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.
2. **Current state**: 
   - `idx` is `k`
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been incremented by `k`
   - `len(permutation)` is greater than `nk + n + k - 2`
   - If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced with `bottom_v + 1`
   - If `idx` is odd, `top_v` is set to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] - 1`

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has already been incremented by `k`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` itself.

Since `len(permutation)` is already known to be greater than `nk + n + k - 2`, it does not need to be adjusted. The other states (`idx`, `bottom_v`, `top_v`, etc.) are not part of the loop head condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.

**State:**
State: **`idx` is `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `nk + n + k - 2`**
