Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced by `top_v`**

Explanation: The code updates the `permutation` list by assigning the value of `top_v` to the index specified by `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. The condition that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)` remains unchanged. Other variables and their conditions are not affected.
