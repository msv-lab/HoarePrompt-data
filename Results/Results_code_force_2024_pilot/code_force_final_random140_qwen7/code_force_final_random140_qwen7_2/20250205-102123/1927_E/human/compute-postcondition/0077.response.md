Postcondition: `idx` is `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `nk + n + k - 2`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced with `bottom_v + 1`; if `idx` is odd, `top_v` is set to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] - 1`.
