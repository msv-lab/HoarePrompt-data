Output State: **`idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + k`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + k`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v + 1`; if `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is equal to `top_v - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. The conditions for `idx` being even or odd remain unchanged, and the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is updated accordingly. All other variables and their relationships remain as per the initial state, except for the updated value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.
