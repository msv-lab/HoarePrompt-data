Postcondition: **`permutation` is a list of n zeros. `n` and `k` are integers with 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k being even. `bottom_v` and `top_v` are integers. If `idx` is even (`idx % 2 == 0`), then `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is n, `permutation[0]` is 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 0. Otherwise, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is n-1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `top_v - 1`, and `idx` is not even.**
