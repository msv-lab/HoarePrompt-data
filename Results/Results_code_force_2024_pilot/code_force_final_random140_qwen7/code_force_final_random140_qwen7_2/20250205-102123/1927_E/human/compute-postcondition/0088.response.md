Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced with `bottom_v`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `bottom_v` to the element in the `permutation` list at the index specified by `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. The condition that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)` remains unchanged. Other variables and their relationships remain unaffected.
