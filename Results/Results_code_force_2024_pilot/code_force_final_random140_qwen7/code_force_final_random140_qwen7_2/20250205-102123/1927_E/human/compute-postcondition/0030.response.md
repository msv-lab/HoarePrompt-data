Output State: The `permutation` list will be filled such that it starts with 1 at index 0, then alternates between increasing `bottom_v` and decreasing `top_v` based on the value of `k`. Specifically, the first `k` elements (0 to `k-1`) will be filled as follows:

- If `k` is even and within the bounds of the list, the first half of these positions will be filled with values starting from `bottom_v` (which starts at 1) up to `bottom_v + k/2 - 1`.
- The second half of these positions will be filled with values starting from `top_v` (which starts at `n`) down to `top_v - k/2 + 1`.

All other elements in the `permutation` list will remain as zeros since the loop only modifies indices that are multiples of `k`. The `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `idx` variable will also be updated but will not affect the final state of the `permutation` list as it is incremented within the loop and does not influence the placement of values directly.

In summary, the `permutation` list will have the first `k` elements filled according to the described pattern, and all other elements will remain zero.
