Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and two strings `s` and `f` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for each test case.**
