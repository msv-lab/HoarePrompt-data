Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `hd` is 0, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `s1` is updated to the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if s1[i] != s2[i]:
        hd += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `hd` is 1, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is updated to the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`. At the current index `i`, the character in `s1` is not equal to the character in `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `hd` is 2, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is updated to the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `i` is `i` + 1. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` changes to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `hd` is 3, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `s1` is updated to the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `i` is `i` + 1, and `res` is updated to the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2` at index `i` if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
