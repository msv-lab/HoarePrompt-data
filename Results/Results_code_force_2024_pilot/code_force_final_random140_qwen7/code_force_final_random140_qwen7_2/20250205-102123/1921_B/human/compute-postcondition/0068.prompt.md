Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    hd = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            hd += 1
    res = abs(s1.count('1') - s2.count('1'))
    print(res + abs(hd - res) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `hd` is equal to the number of positions where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `hd` is equal to the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the original length of `s1` and `s2`, `s1` is the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `hd` is 3, `t` is the initial value of `t` decremented by 3, `n` is greater than 0, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `i` is 3, and the character at index 3 of `s1` is different from the character at index 3 of `s2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
