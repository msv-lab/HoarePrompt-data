Postcondition: **`hd` is 3, `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and is decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s2` is updated to the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `i` is 2, and the current value of `s1[2]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[2]`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering that the if condition is met (the current value of `s1[2]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[2]`), leading to `hd` being updated to 3.
