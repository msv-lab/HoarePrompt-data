Output State: **`hd` is 2, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `hd` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the executed code.
