Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `hd` is 1
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `s1` is updated to the string input by the user
   - `s2` is the string input by the user
   - `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`
   - At the current index `i`, the character in `s1` is not equal to the character in `s2`

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, we need to update these values.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current value of `i`, and `n` is the current value of `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (assuming `i` starts from 0), so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same unless the loop body changes its value, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **New State**:
   - `hd` remains 1
   - `t` remains the same (within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0)
   - `s1` and `s2` remain the same (strings input by the user)
   - `res` remains the same (absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`)
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`hd` is 1, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is updated to the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `i` is i + 1**
