#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and both s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        hd = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s1[i] != s2[i]:
                hd += 1
        
        res = abs(s1.count('1') - s2.count('1'))
        
        print(res + abs(hd - res) // 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `t` (the initial input integer) is now 0 since it was decremented by itself in each iteration. For each pair of strings `s1` and `s2` processed within the loop, `hd` is the total number of differing characters between `s1` and `s2`. The variable `res` is the absolute difference between the counts of '1's in `s1` and `s2`. The final output for each iteration is `res + abs(hd - res) // 2`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to make `s1` and `s2` identical, considering both the differing positions and the count of '1's. All other variables and their states remain as they were last updated within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to make `s1` and `s2` identical. This is determined by considering both the differing positions of '0's and '1's and the absolute difference in the count of '1's between the two strings. The function prints the result for each test case and does not return any value.
