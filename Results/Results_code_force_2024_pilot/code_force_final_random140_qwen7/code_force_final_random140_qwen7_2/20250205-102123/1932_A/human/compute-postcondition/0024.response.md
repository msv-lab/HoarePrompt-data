Output State: **`j` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value, `b` is a non-empty string, `s` is 2, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one.**

Explanation: The code `s = s + 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Given the initial state, `s` was set such that if the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Since the character at index `j` of `b` is not '@' (as per the initial state), `s` remains 1 initially. After executing the code, `s` becomes 2. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
