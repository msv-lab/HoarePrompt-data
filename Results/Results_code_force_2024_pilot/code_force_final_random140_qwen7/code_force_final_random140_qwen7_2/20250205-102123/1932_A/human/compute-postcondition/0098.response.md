Output State: **`s` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 2, `d` is an input integer**.

The code `d = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `d`. The values of `s`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `d` as "an input integer" is preserved, indicating that `d` now holds the integer value entered by the user.
