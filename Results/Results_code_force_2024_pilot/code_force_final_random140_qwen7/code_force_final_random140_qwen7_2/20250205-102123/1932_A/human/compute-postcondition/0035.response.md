Output State: **`j` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value, `b` is a non-empty string, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one, `s` is 3**.

Explanation: Initially, `s` is set to 2 if the character at index `j` of `b` is '@'. After executing `s = s + 1`, `s` is incremented by 1, making its value 3. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
