Output State: **`s` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code snippet sets `s` to 0. This resets `s` to 0 regardless of its previous value, which was 3. The values of `j`, `i`, and `d` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, `j` is still 0, `i` is still 1, and `d` remains an input integer.
