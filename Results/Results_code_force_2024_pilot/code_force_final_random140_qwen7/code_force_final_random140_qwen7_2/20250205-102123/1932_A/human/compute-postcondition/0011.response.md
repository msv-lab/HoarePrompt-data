Output State: **`j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `b` is a non-empty string, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial state where `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1 and the character at index `j` of `b` is '*', the `break` statement simply indicates that we exit the loop or conditional structure without altering the values of `j` or `b`.
