Postcondition: `s` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of the string `b`, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of whether `b[j + 1]` is '*', as the condition does not change the values of the variables other than potentially breaking the loop.
