Output State: **`s` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of the string `input()`, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` must be a non-empty string, and the current value of `b[j]` is '@'**.

Explanation: The variable `s` was initially set to 0. After executing `s = s + 1`, the value of `s` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `j`, `i`, `d`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
