Output State: **`s` is 1 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` remains 0; `j` is equal to the length of the string `b`; `i` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement is effectively breaking out of the context where it was placed. The values of `s`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged as no assignment or modification is performed by the `break` statement itself.
