Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is the loop variable that will take values from `0` to `len(b) - 1`.
   - `b` is the string over which the loop iterates.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(b)`.

4. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `a` is a non-negative integer.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` is an input string.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 0`, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to 0.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be a non-empty string (i.e., `len(b) > 0`).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `b`.

**Final State**:
- `j` is 0.
- `b` is a non-empty string.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`j` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string**.
