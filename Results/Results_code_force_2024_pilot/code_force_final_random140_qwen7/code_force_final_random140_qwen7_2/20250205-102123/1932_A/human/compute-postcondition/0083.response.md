Output State: **`s` is 2 if `b[0]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 1; `j` is 0; `i` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the conditional block where `s` was being checked and set based on the value of `b[0]`. The values of `j`, `i`, and `d` remain unchanged. The condition for setting `s` based on `b[0]` is still valid.
