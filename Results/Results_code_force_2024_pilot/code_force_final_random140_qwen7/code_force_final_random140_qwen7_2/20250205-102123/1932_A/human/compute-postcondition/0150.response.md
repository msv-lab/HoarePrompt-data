Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters ('.', '@', '*'). For each test case, it counts the number of coins ('@') in the string and prints the count. After processing all test cases, it resets the count to zero and continues to the next test case until all `t` test cases are processed. The function does not return any value but prints the count of coins for each test case.**
