Output State: **`s` is 1, `j` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, and the current value of `b[j]` is '@'**

The code `s = s + 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Initially, `s` is 0, so after executing the code, `s` becomes 1. The values of `j`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
