Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-negative integer, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if j == len(b) - 1:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is an integer, `b` is a non-empty string. If the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, if the character at index `j` of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `j` of `b` is neither '@' nor '*', then `j` remains 0, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value, `b` is a non-empty string, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one. If the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', then `s` is 2. If the character at index `j` of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value, `b` is a non-empty string, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one. If the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', `s` is 2. If the character at index `j` of `b` is not '@' and the character at index `j+1` of `b` is '*', the loop or if statement is broken. If the character at index `j+1` of `b` is not '*', `s` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
