Postcondition: `s` is 1, `j` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, and if `b[j]` is '@', then `s` is set to 1 and `j` is set to 0. Otherwise, `j` is either 0 or equal to the length of `b` minus 1, and if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, if `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus 1, we ensure that the next character `b[j + 1]` is not '*', and if it is '*', we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
