Postcondition: **`s` is 1 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` remains 0. `j` is equal to the length of the string `b`, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer. If `b[j]` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[j]` is not '*', no action is taken regarding the variables `s`, `j`, `i`, `d`, and the program continues as normal.**
