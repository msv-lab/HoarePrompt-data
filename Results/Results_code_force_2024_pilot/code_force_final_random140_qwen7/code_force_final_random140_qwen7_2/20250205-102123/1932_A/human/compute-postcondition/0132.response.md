Output State: **`s` is 2, `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `b` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b[0]` is not '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `b[j] == '@'**.

The value of `s` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `j`, `i`, `b`, and the condition for breaking out of the loop remain unchanged from the initial state.
