Output State: **`j` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value, `b` is a non-empty string, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered within the scope of the `break` statement, the conditions and values of `j`, `b`, and the character at index `j` of `b` remain unchanged.
