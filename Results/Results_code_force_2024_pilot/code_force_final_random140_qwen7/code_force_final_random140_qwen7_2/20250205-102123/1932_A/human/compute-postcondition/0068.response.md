Postcondition: `s` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of the string `input()`, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, and the current character of `b[j]` is '@'. If `b[j]` is not '@', then `s` remains 0, `j` is equal to the length of the string `b`, and if `b[j]` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[j]` is not '*', no action is taken regarding the variables `s`, `j`, `i`, `d`, and the program continues as normal.
