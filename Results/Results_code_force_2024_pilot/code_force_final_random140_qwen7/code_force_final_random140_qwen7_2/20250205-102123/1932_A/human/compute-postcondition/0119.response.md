Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is 0 (since `b[j]` is not '@')
   - `j` is either 0 or equal to the length of `b` minus 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `b` is an input string with at least 1 character
   - `b[j]` is not '@'
   - If `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, we break out of the loop.
   - If `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus 1, we ensure that the next character `b[j + 1]` is not '*'.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `len(b) - 1`.

3. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < len(b)`.

4. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since `j` is either 0 or equal to the length of `b` minus 1, and `b[j]` is not '@', the loop will not continue if `j` is already at the end of the string (`len(b) - 1`).

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be 0. If `j` is 0, then `j + 1` would be 1, and we need to check that `b[1]` is not '*'.
   - If `j` is not 0, the loop will terminate because `b[j]` is not '@' and `j` cannot be `len(b) - 1` without breaking the loop.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to set `j` to 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `s` remains 0 because `b[j]` is still not '@'.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `b` remains the same.
   - Ensure that `b[0]` is not '*'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b[0]` is not '*'**
