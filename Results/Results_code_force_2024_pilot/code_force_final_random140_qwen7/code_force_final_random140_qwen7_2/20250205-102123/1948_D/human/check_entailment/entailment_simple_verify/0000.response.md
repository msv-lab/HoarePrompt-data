### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring.

#### Initial Analysis:
- The function `func_1` iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats from the largest possible (half the length of the string) down to 1.
- For each possible length `j`, it checks every substring of length `j` to see if it forms a tandem repeat when considering question marks (`?`).
- If a tandem repeat is found, it prints the length of the repeat and returns immediately.
- If no tandem repeat is found, it returns 0.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Handling Question Marks**: The function checks if the current character and the character `j` positions ahead are either equal or one of them is a question mark. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for forming a tandem repeat.
2. **Maximizing Tandem Repeat Length**: The function does not attempt to replace question marks to form the longest possible tandem repeat. It simply checks the existing characters and question marks without trying different combinations.

#### Example Analysis:
- Given the input `code?????s`, the function will check for tandem repeats of lengths 7, 6, 5, ..., 1.
- For `j = 7`, it will check the substring "code?????s". Since there are no matching pairs, it will move to the next length.
- For `j = 6`, it will check "ode????s". Again, no matching pairs, so it moves to the next length.
- This process continues until it finds a tandem repeat or exhausts all possibilities.

#### Counterexample:
- Consider the input `code?????s`. The expected output should be `10` because we can replace the question marks to form the tandem repeat `codesssses`.
- However, the current implementation does not attempt to replace the question marks to form the longest possible tandem repeat. It simply checks if the current characters and question marks form a tandem repeat, which is not sufficient.

#### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not attempt to replace question marks to form the longest possible tandem repeat. It only checks if the existing characters and question marks form a tandem repeat, which is not enough to ensure the maximum length of the tandem repeat.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
