Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `j` is initialized to `n // 2`.
   - `count` is equal to `j`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   - The expression to evaluate is `count * 2`.

3. **Determine `count`**:
   - Since `count` is equal to `j`, and `j` is initialized to `n // 2`, `count` is also equal to `n // 2`.

4. **Evaluate `count * 2`**:
   - Therefore, `count * 2` is `(n // 2) * 2`, which simplifies to `n`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output `n`.

Output: **n**
