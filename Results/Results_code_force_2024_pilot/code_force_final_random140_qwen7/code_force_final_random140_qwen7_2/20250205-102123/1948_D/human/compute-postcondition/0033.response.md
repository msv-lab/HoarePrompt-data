Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `k_prev + 2`, and `count` is either increased by 1 or reset to 0 depending on whether `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]` is true, and the condition `count == j` is checked, if true, `count` remains unchanged, otherwise, `count` is reset to 0.
