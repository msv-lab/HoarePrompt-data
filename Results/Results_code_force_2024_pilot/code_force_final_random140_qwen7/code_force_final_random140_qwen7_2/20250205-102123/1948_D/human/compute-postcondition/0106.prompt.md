You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each testcase, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations without `count` ever reaching the value of `j`. Therefore, the function does not print any value and returns nothing. The variables `k`, `n`, `j`, and `count` retain their final values from the last iteration, but since no specific values are given for these variables after the loop, we can only state that `count` did not reach the value of `j` during any iteration.
    #
    #In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop did not meet the condition `count == j` at any point, so it did not print any value and returned nothing. The variables `k`, `n`, `j`, and `count` have values that are the result of the last iteration of the loop, but since the exact values are not specified, we know only that `count` never reached the value of `j`.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns either `j`, which is initialized to `n // 2` and `count` is equal to `j`, or `None` or `0` depending on the conditions met, or does not return any value if there is no return statement.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of `j`, which is initialized to `n // 2` and `count` is equal to `j`.

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.

Case_4: The program returns None

Case_5: The program returns 0

Case_6: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.

Case_7: The program returns 0

Case_8: The program returns None

Case_9: The program returns None

Case_10: The program returns 0


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
