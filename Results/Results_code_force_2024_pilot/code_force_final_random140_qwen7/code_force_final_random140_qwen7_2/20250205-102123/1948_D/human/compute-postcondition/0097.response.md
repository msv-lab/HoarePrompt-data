Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
- `j` is 0.
- `count` is not equal to `j`, which is true since `count` is 3 and `j` is 0.
- `k` is `n - 1` under certain conditions, but these conditions do not affect the value of `count`.

The expression `print(count * 2)` simply multiplies the value of `count` by 2 and prints it. Since `count` is 3, `count * 2` will be 6.

Output: **6**
