Postcondition: `count` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `count` is not equal to `j`, and `k` is now `n - 1` if either `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `count` is not equal to `j`, and `k` is now `n - 1`.
