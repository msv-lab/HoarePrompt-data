Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each testcase, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is at least 2, `j` is initialized to `n // 2`, `k` is `k_prev + (n - j)`, and `count` is either increased by 1 in each iteration as long as the conditions `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]` are met, or reset to 0 if `count` reaches `j`. If `count` equals `j` at any point during the loop, the loop prints `count * 2` and terminates.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations without `count` ever reaching the value of `j`. Therefore, the function does not print anything and there is no specific return value mentioned in the provided conditions. The variables `k`, `n`, `j`, and `count` retain their final values from the last iteration, but since no specific values are given for these variables after the loop, we can only state that `count` did not reach `j` during any iteration.

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop did not meet the condition `count == j` at any point, so it did not print any value and returned nothing. The variables `k`, `n`, `j`, and `count` have values that are the result of the last iteration of the loop, but since the exact values are not specified, we know only that `count` never reached the value of `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has executed all iterations without `count` ever reaching a value equal to `j`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
