#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each testcase, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations without `count` ever reaching the value of `j`. Therefore, the function does not print any value and returns nothing. The variables `k`, `n`, `j`, and `count` retain their final values from the last iteration, but since no specific values are given for these variables after the loop, we can only state that `count` did not reach the value of `j` during any iteration.
    #
    #In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop did not meet the condition `count == j` at any point, so it did not print any value and returned nothing. The variables `k`, `n`, `j`, and `count` have values that are the result of the last iteration of the loop, but since the exact values are not specified, we know only that `count` never reached the value of `j`.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function iterates through a string `s` to find pairs of characters that are either identical or one of them is a question mark (`?`). If it finds a sequence where the number of matching pairs equals half the length of the remaining substring, it prints twice the length of this sequence and returns. If no such sequence is found, it returns 0. If the function does not meet any of the above conditions, it returns None.
