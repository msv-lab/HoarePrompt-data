Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`, `total_cost` is `total_cost + cost`**.

Explanation: The code `total_cost += cost` updates the value of `total_cost` by adding the current value of `cost` to it. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `tickets_to_buy`, and `cost`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
