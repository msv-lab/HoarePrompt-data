Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`**

The code assigns the value of `tickets_to_buy` to the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. Since the initial values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this line of code, they remain as specified in the initial state. The value of `tickets_to_buy` depends on the values of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, but without specific values for these variables, we can only express `tickets_to_buy` as the minimum of the two.
