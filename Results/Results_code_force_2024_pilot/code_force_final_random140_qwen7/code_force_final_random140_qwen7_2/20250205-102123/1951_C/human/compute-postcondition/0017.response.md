Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of test cases submitted, `n` is an input integer for each test case, `m` is an input integer for each test case, `k` is an input integer for each test case, `prices` is a list of integers for each test case obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for each test case.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will have been decremented to zero, and for each iteration, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` will hold the respective values for that particular test case, while `result` will store the outcome of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for that test case.
