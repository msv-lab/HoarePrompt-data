Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`, `total_cost` is `total_cost + cost', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is within. All the initial conditions and variable states remain unchanged except for indicating that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
