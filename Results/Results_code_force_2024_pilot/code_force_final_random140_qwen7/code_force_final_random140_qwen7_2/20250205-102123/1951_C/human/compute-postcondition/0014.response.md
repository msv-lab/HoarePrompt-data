Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned to new input integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices), prices` is updated to a new list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code updates the `prices` variable to a new list of integers obtained from user input split and converted to integers. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous values.
