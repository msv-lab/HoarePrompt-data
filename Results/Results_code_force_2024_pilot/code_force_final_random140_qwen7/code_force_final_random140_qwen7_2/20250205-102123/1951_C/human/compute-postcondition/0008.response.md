Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from `input()`, `n` is updated to be the first input integer, `m` is updated to be the second input integer, `k` is updated to be the third input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `t`, `prices`, and `result` remain unchanged from their initial state.
