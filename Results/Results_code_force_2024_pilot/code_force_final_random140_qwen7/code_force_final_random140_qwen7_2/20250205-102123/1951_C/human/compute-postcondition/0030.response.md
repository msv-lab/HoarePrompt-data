Output State: **All tickets have been bought, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, `total_cost` is the sum of the costs calculated over all iterations, and `i` equals `n-1`.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning that the total number of tickets `k` has been fully purchased across the `n` sale days. The variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, indicating the last day the loop ran. The `total_cost` reflects the cumulative expense of buying the tickets, with each purchase made at the lowest possible price given the remaining tickets needed and the daily limit `m`. The loop breaks once the exact number of tickets `k` is bought, ensuring no extra purchases are made beyond the required amount.
