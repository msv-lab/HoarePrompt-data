Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `prices` is a list of integers.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.
- `prices` is updated to a new list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers.

The `print(result)` statement will print the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

Since the exact value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, the precise value cannot be determined without knowing the function's logic. However, we know it is the result of calling `func_1` with the provided arguments.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices))**
