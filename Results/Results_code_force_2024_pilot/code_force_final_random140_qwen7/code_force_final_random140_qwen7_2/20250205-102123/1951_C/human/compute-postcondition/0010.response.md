Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. Since the function call does not specify what `func_1` returns, the return value of `func_1` is stored in the variable `result`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
