### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the sorting step in `func_1` is unnecessary. However, let's re-evaluate the entire program to ensure that the logic and handling of the test cases are indeed correct.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through each day, determining how many tickets can be bought on that day (`tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)`).
   - It calculates the cost for those tickets and adds it to the total cost.
   - It updates the count of tickets bought and breaks out of the loop once `k` tickets are bought.
   - The logic for buying tickets is correct and ensures that the total cost is minimized, considering the constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of prices.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.
   - The handling of test cases is correct. Each test case is processed independently, and the results are printed correctly.

3. **Unnecessary Sorting**:
   - As mentioned, the sorting step in `func_1` is unnecessary. The algorithm works correctly without sorting the `prices` list because the logic depends on buying tickets based on the current day's price and the remaining tickets to be bought. Sorting does not affect the final result but makes the code less efficient.

Given that the core logic of the program is correct and the handling of test cases is also correct, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct in terms of functionality, even though it includes an unnecessary sorting step.
