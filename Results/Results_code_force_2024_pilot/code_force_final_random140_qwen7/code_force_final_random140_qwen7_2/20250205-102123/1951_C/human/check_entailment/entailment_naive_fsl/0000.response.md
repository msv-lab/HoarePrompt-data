Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where purchasing tickets on a given day affects the prices of subsequent days. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not update the prices array after purchasing tickets on a given day. This means that the prices remain unchanged even after tickets are purchased, which violates the problem's requirement that the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets purchased on the current day.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`
- `prices = [8, 6, 4, 2]`

The correct approach would be:
1. On day 1, buy 2 tickets at a cost of 16 (since the price per ticket is 8 and we buy 2 tickets). The new prices would be `[10, 6, 4]`.
2. On day 2, buy 1 ticket at a cost of 6 (since the price per ticket is now 6 and we buy 1 ticket). The new prices would be `[10, 8]`.
3. On day 3, buy 0 tickets since we have already bought 3 tickets.

However, the provided function does not update the prices array, leading to incorrect calculations. For instance, if we follow the function's logic without updating the prices, it would incorrectly calculate the cost as:
- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at 8 each, total cost = 16.
- Day 2: Buy 1 ticket at 6, total cost = 22.
- Day 3: Buy 0 tickets, total cost remains 22.

This results in a higher cost than necessary. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
