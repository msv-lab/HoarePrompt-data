Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution in `func_1` does not correctly handle the scenario where the price increase occurs after purchasing tickets on a given day. The function simply sorts the prices and buys tickets without considering the price increase for subsequent days. This approach fails to account for the dynamic nature of ticket prices as described in the problem statement.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Iterate through each day and calculate the optimal number of tickets to buy on that day while considering the price increase for subsequent days.
2. Keep track of the remaining tickets to be purchased and adjust the prices accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    """Calculates the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

    Args:
        n: The number of sale days.
        m: The maximum number of tickets purchasable each day.
        k: The total number of tickets to buy.
        prices: A list of prices per ticket for each day.

    Returns:
        The minimum amount of money needed to purchase k tickets.
    """
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the number of tickets that can be bought on this day without exceeding k
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        # Calculate the cost of buying tickets_to_buy tickets on this day
        cost = tickets_to_buy * prices[i]
        
        # Update the total cost
        total_cost += cost
        
        # Update the number of tickets bought
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        # If we have bought k tickets, break out of the loop
        if tickets_bought == k:
            break
        
        # Update the prices for the next days based on the tickets bought today
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            prices[j] += tickets_to_buy
    
    return total_cost

def func_2():
    """Handles input and output for multiple test cases."""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
        print(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the prices are updated dynamically based on the tickets bought each day, which aligns with the problem constraints.
