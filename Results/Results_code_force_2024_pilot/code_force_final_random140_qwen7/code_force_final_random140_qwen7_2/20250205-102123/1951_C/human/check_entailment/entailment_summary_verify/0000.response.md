### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided functions step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to minimize the cost of purchasing exactly `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day, you can buy up to `m` tickets.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of all subsequent days by `x`.

#### Provided Functions:
1. **`func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets.
   - It sorts the `prices` list, which is incorrect because the order of prices matters.
   - It iterates through the days and buys tickets in a greedy manner, but it does not update the prices list after buying tickets.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - This function handles input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input values and calls `func_1` to compute the result.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

#### Function Summary:
- The summary indicates that `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
- `func_1` should calculate the minimum cost by considering the updated prices after each purchase.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Sorting the Prices List**: Sorting the `prices` list is unnecessary because the order of prices matters. The correct approach is to consider the prices in their original order.
- **Updating Prices**: The function `func_1` does not update the prices list after buying tickets. This is a critical issue because the problem statement explicitly mentions that the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets purchased on the current day.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`
- `prices = [8, 6, 4, 2]`

The correct approach would be:
1. On day 1, buy 2 tickets at a cost of 16 (since the price per ticket is 8 and we buy 2 tickets). The new prices would be `[10, 6, 4]`.
2. On day 2, buy 1 ticket at a cost of 6 (since the price per ticket is now 6 and we buy 1 ticket). The new prices would be `[10, 8]`.
3. On day 3, buy 0 tickets since we have already bought 3 tickets.

However, the provided function does not update the prices array, leading to incorrect calculations. For instance, if we follow the function's logic without updating the prices, it would incorrectly calculate the cost as:
- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at 8 each, total cost = 16.
- Day 2: Buy 1 ticket at 6, total cost = 22.
- Day 3: Buy 0 tickets, total cost remains 22.

This results in a higher cost than necessary. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where purchasing tickets on a given day affects the prices of subsequent days. The function `func_1` does not update the prices array after purchasing tickets, leading to incorrect calculations.
