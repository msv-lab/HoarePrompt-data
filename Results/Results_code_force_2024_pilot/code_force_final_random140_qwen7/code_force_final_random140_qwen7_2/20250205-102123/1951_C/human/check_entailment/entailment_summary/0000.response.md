Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function aims to calculate the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets over `n` sale days. It correctly sorts the daily ticket prices and iteratively buys tickets starting from the day with the lowest price. For each day, it buys up to `m` tickets or the remaining number of tickets needed, whichever is smaller. The function then accumulates the total cost of these purchases. This logic aligns with the problem statement and ensures that the tickets are bought in such a way that the total cost is minimized.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of ticket prices, and then calls `func_1` to compute the result. The result is printed for each test case. This function correctly implements the input/output handling and delegates the actual computation to `func_1`.

Given that both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
