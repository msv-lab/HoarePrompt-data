### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Prices**: The function starts by sorting the `prices` list. This step is unnecessary because the problem does not require the prices to be sorted to find the minimum cost. The function should iterate through the prices as they are provided.
2. **Iterating Through Days**: The function iterates through each day, determining how many tickets can be bought on that day (`tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)`). It then calculates the cost for those tickets and adds it to `total_cost`. The function does not update the `prices` list after each purchase, which is a critical mistake according to the problem statement.
3. **Returning Total Cost**: The function returns the total cost once `k` tickets are bought.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the `prices` list. It calls `func_1` to compute the result and prints it.
2. **Input and Output Handling**: The function correctly handles reading and printing the results for each test case.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
The problem requires that the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets purchased on the current day. The provided code does not update the `prices` list after each purchase, leading to incorrect calculations. The original assessment correctly identifies this issue.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly handle the scenario where purchasing tickets on a given day affects the prices of subsequent days. The function `func_1` does not update the `prices` array, leading to incorrect calculations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not update the prices array after each purchase, violating the problem's requirement.
