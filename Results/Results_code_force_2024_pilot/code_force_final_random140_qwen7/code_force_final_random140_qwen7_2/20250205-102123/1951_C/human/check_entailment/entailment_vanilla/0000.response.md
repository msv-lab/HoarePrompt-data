Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets given the constraints.
   - It sorts the `prices` list, which is unnecessary because it doesn't affect the logic of buying tickets based on the given rules.
   - It iterates through each day, determining how many tickets can be bought on that day (`tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)`).
   - It calculates the cost for those tickets and adds it to the total cost.
   - It updates the count of tickets bought and breaks out of the loop once `k` tickets are bought.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of prices.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

### Issues and Correctness

1. **Sorting the Prices List**:
   - The sorting step in `func_1` is unnecessary. The algorithm should work correctly without sorting the prices list because the logic depends on buying tickets based on the current day's price and the remaining tickets to be bought.

2. **Buying Tickets**:
   - The logic for buying tickets is correct. It ensures that tickets are bought in such a way that the total cost is minimized, considering the constraints.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The handling of test cases in `func_2` is correct. It processes each test case independently and prints the result for each.

### Conclusion

Despite the unnecessary sorting step, the core logic of the program is correct. The sorting step does not affect the final result but makes the code less efficient.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct in terms of functionality, even though it includes an unnecessary sorting step.
