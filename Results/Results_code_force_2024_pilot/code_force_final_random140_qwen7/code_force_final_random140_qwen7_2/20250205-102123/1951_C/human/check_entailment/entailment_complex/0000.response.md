Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly initializes `total_cost` to 0 and `tickets_bought` to 0.
   - It sorts the `prices` list, which ensures that tickets are bought starting from the cheapest day.
   - It iterates through each day, buying up to `m` tickets or the remaining number of tickets needed, whichever is smaller.
   - The cost for each batch of tickets is calculated and added to `total_cost`.
   - The process stops once `k` tickets are bought.
   
2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of ticket prices.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.
   
3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the constraints and rules provided.
   - The sorting of prices ensures that tickets are bought at the lowest possible cost first.
   - The iterative approach of buying tickets up to `m` per day ensures that the spending is minimized while respecting the constraints.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
