Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_1` calculates the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day and the increasing prices.
3. `func_2` handles the input and output for multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each test case.
4. The logic in `func_1` sorts the prices and iteratively buys tickets while updating the total cost and reducing the number of tickets to be bought.
5. The constraints and examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.
6. The program correctly processes each test case and prints the minimum cost for each case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
