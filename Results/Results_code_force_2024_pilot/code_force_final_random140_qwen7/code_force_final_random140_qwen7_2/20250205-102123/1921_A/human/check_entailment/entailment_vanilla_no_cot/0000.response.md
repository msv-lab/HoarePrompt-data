Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly identify the sides of the square. It calculates the distance between the first and second point, and then compares it with the distance between the first and third point. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the calculated distances correspond to the sides of the square. 

To correctly solve this problem, you should calculate all pairwise distances between the points and identify the smallest distance as the side length of the square. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the smallest distance will be either the horizontal or vertical distance between any two points. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Calculate all pairwise distances
        distances = []
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                dist = abs(points[i][0] - points[j][0]) + abs(points[i][1] - points[j][1])
                distances.append(dist)
        
        # Find the minimum distance which should be the side length of the square
        side_length = min(distances)
        area = side_length * side_length
        print(area)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that all possible sides of the square are considered and correctly identifies the side length, thus calculating the area accurately.
