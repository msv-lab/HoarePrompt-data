Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all cases. Specifically, the program calculates the distance squared between two pairs of points and prints the smaller value, which does not necessarily represent the area of the square.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 1
-1 -1
1 -1
-1 1
```

The correct area of the square formed by these points is 4, but the program will incorrectly calculate the distance squared between (1, 1) and (-1, -1), which is 8, and then between (1, 1) and (1, -1), which is 4. It will print 4, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify the side length of the square by comparing the distances between all pairs of points and ensuring that the distances represent the sides of the square.
