You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())
        n = (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)
        x = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of four lines with two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the squared distance between the first and third corner, and the squared distance between the first and fourth corner. It then compares these distances and prints the maximum value found across all test cases. If no such maximum exists (i.e., all values are equal), it prints the minimum value instead. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all cases. Specifically, the program calculates the distance squared between two pairs of points and prints the smaller value, which does not necessarily represent the area of the square.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 1
-1 -1
1 -1
-1 1
```

The correct area of the square formed by these points is 4, but the program will incorrectly calculate the distance squared between (1, 1) and (-1, -1), which is 8, and then between (1, 1) and (1, -1), which is 4. It will print 4, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify the side length of the square by comparing the distances between all pairs of points and ensuring that the distances represent the sides of the square.
