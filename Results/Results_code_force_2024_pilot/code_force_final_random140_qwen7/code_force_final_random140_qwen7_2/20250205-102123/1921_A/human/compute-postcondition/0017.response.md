Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the second integer entered, `d` is the third integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `n` is \((a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)\), `e` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer.**

Explanation: The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them, assigning the first integer to `g` and the second integer to `h`. All other variables remain unchanged.
