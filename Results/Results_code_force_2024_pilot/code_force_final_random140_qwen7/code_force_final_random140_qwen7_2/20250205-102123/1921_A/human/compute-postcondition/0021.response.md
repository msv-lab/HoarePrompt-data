Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this does not affect the output of the print statement).
- `steps` is 2.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c` and `d` are the third and fourth integers entered, respectively.
- `e` and `f` are the first and second integers from the input split and converted to integers.
- `g` and `h` are input integers.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).
- `x` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).

The print statement is `print(x)`, which will print the value of `x`.

To determine the value of `x`, we need to know the values of `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f`. Since these are input integers, we cannot specify their exact values without additional information. Therefore, `x` will be the result of the formula \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).

Output: **(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)**
