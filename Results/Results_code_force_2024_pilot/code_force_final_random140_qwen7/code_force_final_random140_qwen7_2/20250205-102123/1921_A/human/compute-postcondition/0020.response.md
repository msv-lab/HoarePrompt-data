Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this does not affect the calculation of `n`).
- `steps` is 2.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c` and `d` are the second and third integers entered respectively.
- `e` and `f` are the first and second integers from input split and converted to integers.
- `g` and `h` are input integers.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).

The expression for `n` involves the difference between `a` and `c`, squared, plus the difference between `b` and `d`, squared. This represents the Euclidean distance squared between the points \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\).

The print statement simply outputs the value of `n`.

Output: **(a - c)² + (b - d)² (where a, b, c, and d are the specified input integers)**
