Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the second integer entered, `d` is the third integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `n` is \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `n` is expressed using the new expressions involving `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
