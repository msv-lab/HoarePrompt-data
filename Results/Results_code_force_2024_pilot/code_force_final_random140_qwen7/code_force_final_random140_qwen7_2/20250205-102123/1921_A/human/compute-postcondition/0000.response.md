Output State: **`t` is the number of testcases entered by the user.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user. The initial state mentions that the function takes no input arguments, but the code now specifies that `t` is set to the integer input from the user. All other information about the coordinates of the squares remains unchanged as they have not been involved in the given code snippet.
