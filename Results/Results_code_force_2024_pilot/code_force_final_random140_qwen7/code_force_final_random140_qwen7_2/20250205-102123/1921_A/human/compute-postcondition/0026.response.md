Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `n` is \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\), `x` is \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\), `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `e` is updated with the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `f` is updated with the second integer from the input split and converted to integer.**

Explanation: The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `e` and `f`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
