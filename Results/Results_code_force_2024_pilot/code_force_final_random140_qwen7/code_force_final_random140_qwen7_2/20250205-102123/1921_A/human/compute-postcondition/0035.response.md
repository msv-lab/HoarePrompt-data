Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It processes a series of test cases, each consisting of four lines with two integers \(x_i, y_i\) per line, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns information about each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases without needing any input parameters directly within its definition. Instead, it expects the test cases to be provided externally (likely through some form of input mechanism not shown here). For each test case, it processes the coordinates given and performs some operation or checks based on these coordinates to determine the nature or validity of the square defined by these coordinates.
