Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `steps` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is the first integer entered.
- `d` is the second integer entered.
- `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer (which is the same as `c`).
- `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer (which is the same as `d`).
- `g` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer (which is the same as `c`).
- `h` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer (which is the same as `d`).
- `n` is calculated as \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).

The print statement is:
```python
print(n)
```

Given the formula for `n`, it will be computed as:
\[ n = (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 \]

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `n`. However, we can describe `n` in terms of these variables.

Output: **(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2**
