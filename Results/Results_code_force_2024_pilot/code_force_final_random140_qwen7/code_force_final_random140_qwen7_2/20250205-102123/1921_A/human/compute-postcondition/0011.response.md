Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this variable does not affect the print statement).
- `steps` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c` and `d` are the first and second integers entered, respectively.
- `e` and `f` are the first and second integers from input split and converted to integers, which means `e = c` and `f = d`.
- `g` and `h` are the first and second integers from the input split and converted to integers, which means `g = c` and `h = d`.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).
- `x` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\), and it is stated that `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `e = c` and `f = d`, the expression for `x` simplifies to \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\), which is the same as the expression for `n`.

Therefore, `x` is equal to `n`.

Output: **n**
