Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer, `n` is (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`. The other variables retain their initial states.
