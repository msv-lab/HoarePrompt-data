Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the second integer entered, `d` is the third integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `n` is \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\), `x` is \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\). If `x > n`, then the function does not change the values of `n` and `x`. Otherwise, the function does not change the values of `n` and `x`.**
