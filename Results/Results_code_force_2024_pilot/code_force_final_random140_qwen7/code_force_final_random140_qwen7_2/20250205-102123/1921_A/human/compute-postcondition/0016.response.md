Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the second integer entered, `d` is the third integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer, `n` is \((a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)\), `e` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer.**

Explanation: The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `e` and `f`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `e` and `f` now hold the values of the integers from the input, while `n` remains as \((a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)\).
