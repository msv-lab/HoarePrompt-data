Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of four lines with two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the squared distance between the first and third corner, and the squared distance between the first and fourth corner. It then compares these distances and prints the maximum value found across all test cases. If no such maximum exists (i.e., all values are equal), it prints the minimum value instead. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
