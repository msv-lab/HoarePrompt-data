The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of nodes in a tree and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n. It also takes a `tree` object, which represents a tree structure with `n` nodes. The function reads the tree edges from standard input, roots the tree at node 0 using a non-recursive approach, and then calls another function `func_4` to compute and return the maximum number `x` based on the given tree and values of `n` and `k`.
