The function processes a tree structure starting from a given vertex `s`. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate two metrics for each subtree rooted at `s`: `good_components[s]` and `remaining_size[s]`. `good_components[s]` represents the sum of `good_components[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` plus the number of child vertices `u` where `remaining_size[u]` meets or exceeds `x`. `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all child vertices `u` where `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`. After processing all vertices, the function returns these two values as a tuple.
