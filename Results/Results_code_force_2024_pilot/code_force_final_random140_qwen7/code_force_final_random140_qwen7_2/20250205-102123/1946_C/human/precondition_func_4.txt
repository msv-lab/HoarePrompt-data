n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. tree is an instance of a custom Tree class representing the tree structure with n vertices, where each vertex is identified by an index from 0 to n-1. The add_edge method of the Tree class is used to add edges between vertices. The root_tree_non_recursive method is used to root the tree at vertex 0 using a non-recursive approach. The func_4 function is expected to compute the maximum number x based on the given tree and values of n and k.
