Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Initialization**: The program correctly initializes a tree structure using the `Tree` class and adds edges between vertices as specified in the input. The tree is rooted at vertex 0 using a non-recursive approach, ensuring the tree is properly structured.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Component Analysis**: The `func_1` function performs a DFS to calculate two important metrics:
   - `good_components`: The sum of `good_components[u]` for all child vertices `u` plus the number of child vertices `u` where `remaining_size[u]` meets or exceeds `x`.
   - `remaining_size`: The sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all child vertices `u` where `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.

3. **Recursive Component Counting and Size Calculation**: The `func_2` function recursively calculates the number of "good" components and their sizes, leveraging the results from `func_1` for subtrees.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**: The `func_4` function uses a binary search to find the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`. This function correctly narrows down the possible values of `x` using the `func_3` function.

5. **Validation Function**: The `func_3` function validates whether the current value of `x` is feasible by checking if the number of good components is sufficient and if the remaining size meets the requirement. It correctly returns `True` or `False` based on the conditions.

6. **Main Function Execution**: The `func_5` function correctly processes the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to compute the desired value `x`.

Given that each function works as intended and collectively they solve the problem as described, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
