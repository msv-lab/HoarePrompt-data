### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Input Handling**:
   - The `Tree` class correctly represents the tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree.
   - The input handling in `func_5` correctly processes the number of vertices (`n`) and edges to remove (`k`), and then adds edges to form the tree.

2. **Tree Rooting**:
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method correctly roots the tree at vertex 0 using a non-recursive approach, ensuring all vertices are properly connected.

3. **Component Analysis**:
   - `func_1` performs a DFS to calculate the number of good components and their sizes. It correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` dictionaries based on the conditions provided.
   - `func_2` recursively calculates the same information but in a more straightforward manner, leveraging the results from `func_1`.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**:
   - `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum size `x` such that removing `k` edges can result in components of size at least `x`.
   - The binary search logic is sound, adjusting the search range based on whether `func_3` returns `True` or `False`.

5. **Validation Function**:
   - `func_3` validates whether the current guess for `x` is feasible by checking the number of good components and the remaining size.
   - The logic in `func_3` ensures that the conditions for `x` are correctly checked.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality without any logical errors or inconsistencies.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: **True**
