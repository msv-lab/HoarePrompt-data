You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a tree structure starting from a given vertex `s`.

    #In more detail, `good_components` will be the total count of components that meet certain criteria (determined by `func_2`) plus any additional components where `remaining_size_subtree` is greater than or equal to `x`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a tree structure to determine the number of "good" components and the remaining size of these components after considering a given threshold `x`. It recursively traverses the tree, counting components that meet specific criteria and aggregating sizes.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), and three integers n, k, and x. It first calls another function `func_1` to get the number of good components (`good_components`) and the size of the remaining connected component (`remaining_size`). If the number of good components is greater than k, it returns True. If the number of good components is exactly k and the remaining size is at least x, it also returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

    #State: Output State: The loop will terminate when `beg` equals `end`.
    #
    #In the given loop, `beg` starts at 1 and `end` starts at `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `beg` is less than `end`. Each iteration adjusts either `beg` or `end` based on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. After multiple iterations, `beg` and `end` will converge to the same value because each adjustment brings them closer together until they meet.
    #
    #Since the loop stops when `beg` equals `end`, the final values of `beg`, `end`, and `mid` will all be the same. The exact value depends on the conditions under which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` evaluates to `True` or `False` during the iterations, but the key point is that the loop terminates when `beg` and `end` are equal.
    return beg
    #The program returns the value at which `beg` and `end` become equal after the loop terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), the number of vertices `n`, and the number of edges `k` to be removed. It then performs a binary search to find a specific value where the variables `beg` and `end` become equal after removing `k` edges from the tree. The function returns this value.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. tree is an instance of a custom Tree class representing the tree structure with n vertices, where each vertex is identified by an index from 0 to n-1. The add_edge method of the Tree class is used to add edges between vertices. The root_tree_non_recursive method is used to root the tree at vertex 0 using a non-recursive approach. The func_4 function is expected to compute the maximum number x based on the given tree and values of n and k.

For each iteration from 1 to `n-1`, an edge was added to the tree between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are integers provided as input. The final state of the tree will have `n` nodes connected by `n-1` edges, forming a tree structure. All nodes from 0 to `n-1` will be reachable from any other node through these edges.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of nodes in a tree and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k < n. It also takes a `tree` object, which represents a tree structure with `n` nodes. The function reads the tree edges from standard input, roots the tree at node 0 using a non-recursive approach, and then calls another function `func_4` to compute and return the maximum number `x` based on the given tree and values of `n` and `k`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Parsing**:
   - The `func_5` function reads the input and constructs a tree.
   - The tree is represented using a class `Tree`, which is not defined in the provided code but assumed to have methods like `add_edge` and `root_tree_non_recursive`.

2. **Finding the Maximum `x`**:
   - The main logic is in `func_4`, which uses binary search to find the maximum value of `x`.
   - The binary search range is between 1 and `n`.
   - For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search, `func_3` is called to check if it's possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `mid` vertices.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` to compute the number of good components (components with at least `x` vertices) and the total remaining size.
   - `func_1` performs a post-order traversal to calculate these values.
   - If the number of good components is greater than `k`, or if the number of good components equals `k` and the total remaining size is at least `x`, then `func_3` returns `True`.

4. **Post-Order Traversal**:
   - `func_1` uses a post-order traversal to ensure that all children of a node are processed before the node itself.
   - It maintains two dictionaries: `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
   - `good_components[v]` stores the number of good components rooted at vertex `v`.
   - `remaining_size[v]` stores the total size of the subtree rooted at vertex `v` that meets the condition.

### Potential Issues

1. **Tree Class Implementation**:
   - The `Tree` class is not provided, and its implementation might not be correct.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is also not defined, and its correctness is assumed.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that the tree is correctly constructed and that the input is valid.
   - There is no explicit handling for edge cases where the tree structure might cause issues during traversal.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic seems correct, but it relies on the correctness of `func_3`, which in turn relies on `func_1`.

### Conclusion

Given that the provided functions seem logically sound and the binary search approach is correct, assuming the `Tree` class and methods are implemented correctly, the program should work as intended.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
