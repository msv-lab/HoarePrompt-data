### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Statement Analysis
The goal is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree results in connected components of at least size \( x \). The key points are:
- The tree is represented by a list of edges.
- We need to check the sizes of the connected components after removing \( k \) edges.
- The function should return the largest \( x \) satisfying the condition.

#### Code Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Reading**
   - `func_5` reads the number of nodes \( n \) and edges \( k \).
   - It constructs a tree object and reads the edges.
   - It roots the tree at node 0 using a non-recursive approach (`root_tree_non_recursive`).

2. **Component Size Calculation**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are recursive functions to calculate the sizes of connected components.
   - `func_1` uses a stack to traverse the tree and calculates `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
   - `func_2` is a helper function that recursively traverses the tree and calculates similar values.

3. **Edge Removal and Component Size Check**
   - `func_3` checks if the number of good components (components of size at least \( x \)) is greater than \( k \).
   - `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges results in components of at least size \( x \).

#### Function Summaries
- `func_5`: Reads input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and calls `func_4`.
- `func_4`: Uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) based on the result of `func_3`.

#### Correctness Evaluation
- **Binary Search (`func_4`)**: The binary search approach is correct. It iteratively narrows down the range of \( x \) using `func_3`.
- **Component Size Calculation (`func_1` and `func_2`)**: These functions traverse the tree and calculate the sizes of connected components. They use a post-order traversal to ensure all children are processed before the parent.
- **Edge Removal Check (`func_3`)**: This function checks if the number of good components (components of size at least \( x \)) is greater than \( k \). If true, it means we can remove \( k \) edges to achieve the desired component sizes.

Given the function summaries and the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The binary search approach ensures that the maximum \( x \) is found efficiently, and the component size calculations are handled correctly.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` work together to find the maximum \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges results in connected components of at least size \( x \).
