Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Parsing**:
   - The `func_5` function reads the input and constructs a tree.
   - The tree is represented using a class `Tree`, which is not defined in the provided code but assumed to have methods like `add_edge` and `root_tree_non_recursive`.

2. **Finding the Maximum `x`**:
   - The main logic is in `func_4`, which uses binary search to find the maximum value of `x`.
   - The binary search range is between 1 and `n`.
   - For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search, `func_3` is called to check if it's possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `mid` vertices.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` to compute the number of good components (components with at least `x` vertices) and the total remaining size.
   - `func_1` performs a post-order traversal to calculate these values.
   - If the number of good components is greater than `k`, or if the number of good components equals `k` and the total remaining size is at least `x`, then `func_3` returns `True`.

4. **Post-Order Traversal**:
   - `func_1` uses a post-order traversal to ensure that all children of a node are processed before the node itself.
   - It maintains two dictionaries: `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
   - `good_components[v]` stores the number of good components rooted at vertex `v`.
   - `remaining_size[v]` stores the total size of the subtree rooted at vertex `v` that meets the condition.

### Potential Issues

1. **Tree Class Implementation**:
   - The `Tree` class is not provided, and its implementation might not be correct.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is also not defined, and its correctness is assumed.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that the tree is correctly constructed and that the input is valid.
   - There is no explicit handling for edge cases where the tree structure might cause issues during traversal.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic seems correct, but it relies on the correctness of `func_3`, which in turn relies on `func_1`.

### Conclusion

Given that the provided functions seem logically sound and the binary search approach is correct, assuming the `Tree` class and methods are implemented correctly, the program should work as intended.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
