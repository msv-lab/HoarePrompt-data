Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` do not seem to properly calculate the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges results in connected components of at least size \( x \).

Here's a key issue:
- The function `func_1` and `func_2` are recursive and seem to be attempting to traverse the tree and calculate the sizes of connected components, but they do not correctly handle the removal of edges and the calculation of the resulting component sizes.
- The function `func_3` checks if the number of good components (components of size at least \( x \)) is greater than \( k \), but it does not ensure that the remaining sizes meet the requirement after removing the edges.
- The function `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \), but it relies on `func_3` which is not correctly implemented.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
6 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
The expected output should be 2, as explained in the example. However, the provided code does not correctly handle the edge removal and component size calculation, leading to incorrect results.

A correct implementation would involve:
1. Traversing the tree to calculate the sizes of all connected components.
2. Using a dynamic programming approach or other method to determine the maximum \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges results in components of at least size \( x \).

Since the provided code does not correctly implement these steps, it fails to meet the problem requirements for at least one case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
