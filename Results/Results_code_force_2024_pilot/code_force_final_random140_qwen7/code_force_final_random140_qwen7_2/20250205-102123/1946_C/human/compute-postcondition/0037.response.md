Postcondition: `good_components[v]'` is updated to its current value plus the value of `good_components[u]'`; `remaining_size[v]'` is updated to its current value plus the value of `remaining_size[u]'`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]'` is additionally incremented by 1; otherwise, `good_components[v]'` remains unchanged.
