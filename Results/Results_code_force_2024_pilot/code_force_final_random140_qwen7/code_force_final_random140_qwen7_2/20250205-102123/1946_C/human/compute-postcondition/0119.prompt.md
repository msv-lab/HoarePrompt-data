Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The stack still contains a series of tuples (u, False) where each u is a child vertex of the previously popped vertex v, and the length of the stack is reduced by one; v is now the vertex that was popped from the stack; postorder is the postorder value associated with the popped vertex v and it is not False; the value of good_components[v] is updated based on the remaining children of v and their respective remaining_size values relative to x; the value of remaining_size[v] is also updated based on the remaining children of v and their respective remaining_size values.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    good_components[v] += good_components[u]
    if remaining_size[u] >= x:
        good_components[v] += 1
    else:
        remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `u` is a child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated by adding either `1` or `good_components[u]` to it depending on whether `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size[v]` is updated based on the remaining children of `v` and their respective `remaining_size` values. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is incremented by `1`; otherwise, `good_components[v]` is incremented by `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is incremented by `remaining_size[u]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u` is the next child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated to include `good_components[u]` plus 1 if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise `good_components[v]` is updated to include `good_components[u]` and `remaining_size[v]` is updated to the original `remaining_size[v]` plus `remaining_size[u]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `u` is the next child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated to include `good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
