Output State: **`u` is the next child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated to include `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size[v]` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the `good_components[v]` variable by adding the value of `good_components[u]` to it. The other variables (`u`, `v`, `postorder`, and `remaining_size[v]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
