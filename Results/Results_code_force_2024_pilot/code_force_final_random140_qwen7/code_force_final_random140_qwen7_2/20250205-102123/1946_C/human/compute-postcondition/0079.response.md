Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `good_components[v]` will be the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, plus the number of children `u` of `v` where `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

In simpler terms, `good_components[v]` will count how many of its children meet the condition `remaining_size[u] >= x`, and `remaining_size[v]` will accumulate the sizes of all children's remaining sizes.
