Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `u` and `v`. The loop iterates over `u` for each vertex `v` in the tree.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body updates `good_components[v]'` and `remaining_size[v]'` based on the condition involving `remaining_size[u]'`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`u`**: This variable changes with each iteration of the loop. It represents a child vertex of `v`.
   - **`v`**: This variable remains constant for the duration of the loop for a given `v`, but it does not change within the loop itself. Therefore, we do not need to adjust the state of `v` for the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Postconditions**:
   - If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]'` is updated to its current value plus 1.
   - Otherwise, `good_components[v]'` is updated to its current value plus the value of `good_components[u]'`, and `remaining_size[v]'` is updated to its current value plus the value of `remaining_size[u]'`.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `v` remains constant, we do not need to adjust its state.
   - For `u`, since it changes with each iteration, we need to consider the new value of `u` for the next iteration.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `good_components[v]'` and `remaining_size[v]'` based on the condition involving `remaining_size[u]'`.

**State:**
- `good_components[v]'` is updated to its current value plus 1 if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, it is updated to its current value plus the value of `good_components[u]'`.
- `remaining_size[v]'` is updated to its current value plus the value of `remaining_size[u]'`.

Since `v` remains constant and `u` changes, we need to reflect the updated values of `good_components[v]'` and `remaining_size[v]'` for the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`good_components[v]'` is updated to its current value plus 1 if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, it is updated to its current value plus the value of `good_components[u]'`, and `remaining_size[v]'` is updated to its current value plus the value of `remaining_size[u]'`.**
