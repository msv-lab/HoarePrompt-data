You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of a Tree class representing the given tree structure, n is the number of vertices in the tree, and k is the number of edges to be removed such that 1 ≤ k < n.
def func_4(tree, n, k):
    beg = 1
    end = n
    while beg < end:
        mid = (beg + end + 1) // 2
        
        if func_3(tree, n, k, mid):
            beg = mid
        else:
            end = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will terminate when `beg` equals `end`.
    #
    #In the given loop, `beg` starts at 1 and `end` starts at `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `beg` is less than `end`. Each iteration adjusts either `beg` or `end` based on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. After multiple iterations, `beg` and `end` will converge to the same value because each adjustment brings them closer together until they meet.
    #
    #Since the loop stops when `beg` equals `end`, the final values of `beg`, `end`, and `mid` will all be the same. The exact value depends on the conditions under which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` evaluates to `True` or `False` during the iterations, but the key point is that the loop terminates when `beg` and `end` are equal.
    return beg
    #The program returns the value at which `beg` and `end` become equal after the loop terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), the number of vertices `n`, and the number of edges `k` to be removed. After removing `k` edges from the tree, it returns the value at which the variables `beg` and `end` become equal.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value at which `beg` and `end` become equal after the loop terminates.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
