Output State: `stack` contains the tuple `None, False`, `v` is `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[s].children`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[s].children`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed for all iterations, `good_components[v]` will have accumulated the value of `good_components[u]` for each child `u` of `v`. Additionally, if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x` for any child `u`, `good_components[v]` will be incremented by 1 for each such child. The variable `remaining_size[v]` will also be updated to the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v`. All other variables remain in their initial or previously calculated states.
