Output State: **`u` is the next child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated to include `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size[v]` will be updated based on the current `u`**.

This means that the value of `good_components[v]` has been updated to include the value of `good_components[u]`. The other variables remain in their previous states.
