Postcondition: `good_components[v]'` is increased by either 1 (if `remaining_size[u] >= x`) or `good_components[u]'` (if `remaining_size[u] < x`), and `u` is set to the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. Additionally, if `remaining_size[u] < x`, `remaining_size[v]'` is increased by `remaining_size[u]'`.
