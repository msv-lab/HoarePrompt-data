Output State: **`i` is 1; `[u - 1, v - 1]` is a list of two integers representing an edge added to the tree.**

Explanation: The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` to the tree. The values of `i` and the list `[u, v]` remain unchanged. The list `[u - 1, v - 1]` now represents the edge added to the tree.
