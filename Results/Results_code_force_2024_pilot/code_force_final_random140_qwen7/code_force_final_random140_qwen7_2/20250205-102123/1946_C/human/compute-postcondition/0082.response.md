Postcondition: **`stack` will contain a series of tuples (u, False), where each u is a child vertex of v, and the length of the stack will be equal to the total number of children of v. `good_components[v]` will be the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, plus the number of children `u` of `v` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` where `remaining_size[u] < x`.**

In natural language: After executing the if-else block, the stack will contain a series of tuples (u, False), where each u represents a child vertex of the initial vertex v, and the number of such tuples will be equal to the total number of children of v. Each tuple indicates that the corresponding vertex u has been added to the stack but the postorder condition has not been checked for these vertices yet. Furthermore, `good_components[v]` will be the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v`, plus the count of children `u` where `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` where `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.
