Postcondition: **The stack still contains a series of tuples (u, False) where each u is a child vertex of the previously popped vertex v, and the length of the stack is reduced by one; v is now the vertex that was popped from the stack; postorder is the postorder value associated with the popped vertex v; the value of good_components[v] is updated based on the remaining children of v and their respective remaining_size values relative to x; the value of remaining_size[v] is also updated based on the remaining children of v and their respective remaining_size values; the value of postorder is not False**
