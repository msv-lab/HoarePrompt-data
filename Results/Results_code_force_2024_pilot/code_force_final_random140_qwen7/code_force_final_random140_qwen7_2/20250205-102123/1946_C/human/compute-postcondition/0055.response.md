Output State: The stack will contain a series of tuples (u, False) where each u is a child vertex of v, and the length of the stack will be equal to the total number of children of v. Each tuple indicates that the corresponding vertex u has been pushed onto the stack with the second element being False, indicating that the postorder condition has not yet been checked for these vertices.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the stack will contain a series of tuples (u, False), where each u represents a child vertex of the initial vertex v. The number of such tuples will be equal to the total number of children of v. Each tuple indicates that the corresponding vertex u has been added to the stack but the postorder condition has not been checked for these vertices yet.
