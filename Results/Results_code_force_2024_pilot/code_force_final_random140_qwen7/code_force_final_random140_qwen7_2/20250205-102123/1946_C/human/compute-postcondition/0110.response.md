Output State: **`u` is the next child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated to include `good_components[u]` plus 1, `remaining_size[v]` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code increments `good_components[v]` by 1. Since `good_components[u]` is included in `good_components[v]`, the new value of `good_components[v]` is `good_components[u] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
