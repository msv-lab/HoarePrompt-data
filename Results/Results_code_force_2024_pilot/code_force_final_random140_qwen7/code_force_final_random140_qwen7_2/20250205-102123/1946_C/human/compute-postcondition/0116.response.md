Output State: **`u` is the next child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated to include `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `remaining_size[v]` by adding `remaining_size[u]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
