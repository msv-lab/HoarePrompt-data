Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stack` contains the tuple `(s, False)`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `good_components` is an empty dictionary, `remaining_size` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        good_components[v] = 0
        remaining_size[v] = 1
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    elif postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            good_components[v] += good_components[u]
            if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                good_components[v] += 1
            else:
                remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stack` contains a series of tuples `(u, False)`, where `u` is each successive child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. The exact number of tuples in the stack depends on the total number of children that `v` has. `v` remains unchanged. `postorder` remains `False`. `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `stack` will contain a series of tuples (u, False), where each u is a child vertex of v, and the length of the stack will be equal to the total number of children of v. `good_components[v]` will be the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, plus the number of children `u` of `v` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` where `remaining_size[u] < x`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The stack will contain a series of tuples (u, False), where each u is a child vertex of the initial vertex v, and the number of such tuples will be equal to the total number of children of v. Additionally, the variable `good_components[v]` will contain the sum of `good_components[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. Furthermore, if the `remaining_size[u]` of any child vertex `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` will be incremented by 1 for each such child. The variable `remaining_size[v]` will be updated to the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
