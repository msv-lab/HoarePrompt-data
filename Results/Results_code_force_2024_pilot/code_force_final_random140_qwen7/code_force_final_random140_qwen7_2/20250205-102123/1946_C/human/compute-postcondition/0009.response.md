Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `u` and `v`. The initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid. The values of `u` and `v` depend on the user's input, hence they are described as "an input integer" and "an input integer" respectively.
