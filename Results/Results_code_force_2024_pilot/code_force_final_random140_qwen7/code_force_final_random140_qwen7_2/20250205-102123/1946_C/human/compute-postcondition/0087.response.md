Output State: **`stack` now contains a tuple `(v, True)` appended to its previous contents, `v` is now the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with the popped vertex `v`, the value of `good_components[v]` is updated to `0`, the value of `remaining_size[v]` is updated to `1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `remaining_size[v]` to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
