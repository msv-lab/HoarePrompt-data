Postcondition: **The stack will contain a series of tuples (u, False), where each u is a child vertex of the initial vertex v, and the number of such tuples will be equal to the total number of children of v. Additionally, the variable `good_components[v]` will contain the sum of `good_components[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. Furthermore, if the `remaining_size[u]` of any child vertex `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` will be incremented by 1 for each such child. The variable `remaining_size[v]` will be updated to the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**
