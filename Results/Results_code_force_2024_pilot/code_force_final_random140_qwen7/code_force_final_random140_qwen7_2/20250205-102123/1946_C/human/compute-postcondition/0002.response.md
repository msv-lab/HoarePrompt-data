Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and the range `1, n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Consider the given state**: We know that `n` is an integer obtained from input, and `k` is another integer obtained from input. A `Tree` object named `tree` has been created with `n` nodes.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 1, and the loop will continue as long as `i < n`, we need to ensure that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1 (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:
**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

So, the answer is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
