Postcondition: `good_components[v]` is increased by either 1 (if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`) or by `good_components[u]` (if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`). Additionally, if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` and `good_components[u]` remains unchanged.
