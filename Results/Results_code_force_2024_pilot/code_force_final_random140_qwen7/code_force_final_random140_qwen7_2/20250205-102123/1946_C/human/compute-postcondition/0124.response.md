Output State: **The program returns the tuple (good_components[s], remaining_size[s]) where `good_components[s]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` in `tree.vertices[s].children`, plus the number of child vertices `u` of `s` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`, and `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` in `tree.vertices[s].children` where `remaining_size[u] < x`.**

This means that the program calculates two values:
1. `good_components[s]`: This is determined by summing up the values of `good_components[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` and adding the count of child vertices `u` where `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`.
2. `remaining_size[s]`: This is calculated by summing up the values of `remaining_size[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` where `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.

Both these values are then returned as a tuple.
