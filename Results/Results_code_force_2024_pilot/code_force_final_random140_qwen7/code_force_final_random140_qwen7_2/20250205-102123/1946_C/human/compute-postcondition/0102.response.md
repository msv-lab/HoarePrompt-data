Output State: **`u` is a child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated by adding `1` to it, `remaining_size[v]` is updated based on the remaining children of `v` and their respective `remaining_size` values, and the current value of `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The line `good_components[v] += 1` increments the value of `good_components[v]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
