Output State: **`good_components[v]'` is updated to its current value plus the value of `good_components[u]'`; `remaining_size[v]'` is updated to its current value plus the value of `remaining_size[u]'`**.

Explanation: The code `good_components[v] += good_components[u]` updates `good_components[v]` to its current value plus the value of `good_components[u]`. It does not depend on the condition involving `remaining_size[u]`. Similarly, the comment suggests that `remaining_size[v]` should be updated to its current value plus the value of `remaining_size[u]`, which is also not affected by the condition. Therefore, both `good_components[v]` and `remaining_size[v]` are updated according to the provided instructions.
