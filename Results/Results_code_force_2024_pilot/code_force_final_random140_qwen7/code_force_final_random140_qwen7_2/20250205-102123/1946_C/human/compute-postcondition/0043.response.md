Output State: **`stack` is now one element shorter, `v` is the last element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is set to `True`, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**

Explanation: The code `v, postorder = stack.pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `v` and sets `postorder` to `True`. The values of `good_components[v]` and `remaining_size[v]` remain unchanged as they are calculated based on the children of `v` in the tree structure. The `stack` is now one element shorter because the last element was popped.
