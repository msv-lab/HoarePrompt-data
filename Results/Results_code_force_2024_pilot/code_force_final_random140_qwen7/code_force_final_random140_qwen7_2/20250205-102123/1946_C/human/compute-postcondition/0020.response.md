Output State: **`beg` is `mid`, `end` is `mid - 2`, `mid` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `end` is updated to `mid - 1`. Given the initial state where `end` is either `n` or `mid - 1`, after updating `end` to `mid - 1`, the new value of `end` becomes `mid - 2`. The values of `beg` and the formula for `mid` remain unchanged.
