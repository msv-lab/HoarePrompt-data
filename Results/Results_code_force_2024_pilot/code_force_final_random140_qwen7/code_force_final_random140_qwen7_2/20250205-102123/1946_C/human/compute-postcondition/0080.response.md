Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `good_components[v]` will be the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, plus the number of children `u` of `v` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` where `remaining_size[u] < x`.**

This means that `good_components[v]` accumulates the `good_components[u]` values from all children `u` of `v` and adds 1 for each child `u` whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. On the other hand, `remaining_size[v]` accumulates the `remaining_size[u]` values from all children `u` of `v` where `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.
