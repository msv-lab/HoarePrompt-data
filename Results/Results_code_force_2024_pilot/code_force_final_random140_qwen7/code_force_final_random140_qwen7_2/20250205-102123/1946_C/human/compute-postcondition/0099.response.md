Output State: **`u` is a child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated by adding `good_components[u]` to it, `remaining_size[v]` is updated based on the remaining children of `v` and their respective `remaining_size` values.**

In this output state, the `good_components[v]` variable has been updated by adding the value of `good_components[u]` to it, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
