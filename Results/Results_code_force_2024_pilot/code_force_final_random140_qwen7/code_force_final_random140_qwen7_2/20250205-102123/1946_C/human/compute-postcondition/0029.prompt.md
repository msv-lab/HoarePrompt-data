You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `tree` is an instance of a class representing a tree structure, `v` is the root vertex of the tree, and `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing the edges.
def func_2(tree, v, x):
    good_components = 0
    remaining_size = 1
    for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
        good_components_subtree, remaining_size_subtree = func_2(tree, u, x)
        
        good_components += good_components_subtree
        
        if remaining_size_subtree >= x:
            good_components += 1
        else:
            remaining_size += remaining_size_subtree
        
    #State: Output State: `good_components` is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus additional increments based on the condition, `remaining_size` is the final aggregated value after all iterations, `v` is the initial vertex in `tree`, and `u` iterates through all child vertices of `v` until the loop completes.
    #
    #In more detail, `good_components` will be the total count of components that meet certain criteria (determined by `func_2`) plus any additional components where `remaining_size_subtree` is greater than or equal to `x`. The exact value depends on the specific outputs of `func_2` for each subtree and the condition checks during each iteration. `remaining_size` will reflect the cumulative effect of the operations performed within the loop, specifically when `remaining_size_subtree` is added to it if the condition is not met.
    print(v, good_components, remaining_size)
    #This is printed: v, good_components (where good_components is the sum of all good_components_subtree values plus additional increments based on the condition), remaining_size (where remaining_size reflects the cumulative effect of the operations performed within the loop)
    return good_components, remaining_size
    #The program returns `good_components`, which is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus additional increments based on the condition, and `remaining_size`, which is the final aggregated value after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a tree structure represented by an instance `tree`, a root vertex `v`, and an integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing the edges. It returns two values: `good_components`, which is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus additional increments based on the condition, and `remaining_size`, which is the final aggregated value after all iterations.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `good_components`, which is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus additional increments based on the condition, and `remaining_size`, which is the final aggregated value after all iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
