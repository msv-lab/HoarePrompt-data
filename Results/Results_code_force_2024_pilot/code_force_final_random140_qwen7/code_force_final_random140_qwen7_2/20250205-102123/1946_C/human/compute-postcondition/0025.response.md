Output State: **The program returns the value at which `beg` and `end` become equal after the loop terminates.**

This means that the program returns the final value of `beg` (which is the same as `end`), after the loop has converged and stopped executing because `beg` equals `end`. The exact value depends on the conditions within the loop, specifically the evaluations of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, but the key outcome is that the loop ends when `beg` and `end` are the same.
