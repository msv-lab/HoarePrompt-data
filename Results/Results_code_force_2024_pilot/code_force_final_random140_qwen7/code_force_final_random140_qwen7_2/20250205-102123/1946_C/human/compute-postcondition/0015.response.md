Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n), and tree (an instance of a custom Tree class). It computes and returns the maximum number x based on the given tree structure and values of n and k.**

This means the function `func_5` takes three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer less than `n`), and `tree` (an instance of a custom Tree class). The function then processes the tree rooted at vertex 0 using a non-recursive approach and calculates the maximum number `x` based on the tree structure and the values of `n` and `k`. The result of this calculation is returned by the function.
