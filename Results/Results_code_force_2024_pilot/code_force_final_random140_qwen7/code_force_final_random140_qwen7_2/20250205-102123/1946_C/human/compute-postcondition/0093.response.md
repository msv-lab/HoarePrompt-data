Output State: **stack contains (u, False), (u, False)**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((u, False))` appends the tuple `(u, False)` to the stack. Initially, the stack contains `(u, False)` and the next `(u, False)`. After executing the code, the stack will have two tuples: `(u, False)` and another `(u, False)`.
