Output State: The stack will contain multiple tuples of the form (u, False), where each u is a child vertex of v, and the number of such tuples will depend on the number of children v has. Each tuple indicates that the corresponding vertex u has been pushed onto the stack but has not yet been processed.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the stack will contain a series of tuples (u, False), where each u is a descendant vertex of v, and the order of these tuples in the stack reflects the depth-first traversal order starting from v. The variable `good_components[v]` will be updated to reflect the final state after processing all descendants, and `remaining_size[v]` will be updated to the total number of vertices in the subtree rooted at v, including v itself.
