Based on the initial state provided:

1. The loop has executed `n-1` times, setting `i` to `n-1`. This means that there are `n-1` edges connecting `n` nodes, forming a tree structure.
2. For each iteration from 1 to `n-1`, an edge was added between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are integers provided as input.
3. The function `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` has been called, which likely sets up the root of the tree with node 0 and a parent node of -1 (indicating no parent).

Given this setup, the function `func_4(tree, n, k)` is being called. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_4`, we can infer that it likely depends on the structure of the tree and possibly the value of `k`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_4` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise output. But we can describe the context in which it is called.

Output: **func_4(tree, n, k) (where tree is a tree structure with n nodes and n-1 edges, and k is an integer)**
