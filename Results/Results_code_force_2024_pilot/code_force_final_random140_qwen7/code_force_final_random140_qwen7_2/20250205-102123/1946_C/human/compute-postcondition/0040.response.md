Postcondition: **`stack` contains the tuple `None, False`, `v` is `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[s].children`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[s].children`.**

Explanation: After executing the if statement, the `stack` remains unchanged and still contains the tuple `None, False`. The variable `v` is still `s`, `postorder` remains `True`, and `good_components[v]` is updated to the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v`. Similarly, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v`. These updates reflect the accumulation of values from the children nodes as per the given conditions.
