Output State: **`stack` contains a series of tuples (u, False) where each u is a child vertex of the previously popped vertex `v`, and the length of the stack is reduced by one; `v` is now the vertex that was popped from the stack; `postorder` is the postorder value associated with the popped vertex `v`; the value of `good_components[v]` is updated based on the remaining children of `v` and their respective `remaining_size` values relative to `x`; the value of `remaining_size[v]` is also updated based on the remaining children of `v` and their respective `remaining_size` values.**

This means that the tuple `(v, postorder)` has been removed from the stack, and the values of `v` and `postorder` are now known. The `good_components[v]` and `remaining_size[v]` values have been updated according to the rules specified in the initial state.
