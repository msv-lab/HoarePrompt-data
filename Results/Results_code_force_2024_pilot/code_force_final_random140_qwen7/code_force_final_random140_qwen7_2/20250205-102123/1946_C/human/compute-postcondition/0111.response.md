Output State: **`u` is the next child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated to include `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size[v]` is equal to the original `remaining_size[v]` plus `remaining_size[u]`.**

This means that the `remaining_size` of vertex `v` has been updated to include the `remaining_size` of its child vertex `u`. All other variables remain in their original state.
