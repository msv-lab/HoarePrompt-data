Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(num)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `L1` is a list with one element which is an integer entered by the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < num`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `num`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - The value of `num` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `num` being constant for the duration of the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `num` remains the same (a positive integer greater than 0).
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `L1` does not change as it is not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0; `i` is 1 more than its previous value; `L1` is a list with one element which is an integer entered by the user**.
