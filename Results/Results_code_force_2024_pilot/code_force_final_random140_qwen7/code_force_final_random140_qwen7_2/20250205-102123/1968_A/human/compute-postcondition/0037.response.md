Output State: **`j` is 2, `res` contains a value equal to `(L1[i] // 2) * 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, it suggests that the `break` statement is likely within a loop or conditional that was not shown in the provided code snippet. The variables `j` and `res` retain their initial values because the `break` statement does not modify them. Therefore, the only change is that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
