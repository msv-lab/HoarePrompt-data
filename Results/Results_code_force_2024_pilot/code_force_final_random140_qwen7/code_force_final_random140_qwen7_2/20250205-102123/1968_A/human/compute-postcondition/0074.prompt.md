You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: Output State: `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num` will be the final value it was set to during the last iteration, `i` will have reached `num` (since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `num-1`), and `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each being an integer input by the user as the loop appended these inputs to the list in each iteration.
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: `num` is the final value it was set to during the last iteration, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `j` is `L1[num] + 2`. `res` is a list containing all the values calculated based on the divisors of each element in `L1` from 2 to the respective element + 1.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: the divisors of each element in L1 from 2 to the respective element + 1, each on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes two variables `t` and `x`, where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `x` is an integer within the range 2 to 1000. The function does not return any value directly but implies that it might perform some operations or checks using these variables.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
