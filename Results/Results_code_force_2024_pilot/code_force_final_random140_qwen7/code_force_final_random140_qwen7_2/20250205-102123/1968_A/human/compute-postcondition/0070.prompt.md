Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is `L1[i + 1] + 1`, `L1[i + 1]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i + 1] + 1`, and `res` contains a list of values calculated based on the divisors of `L1[i + 1]` from 2 to `L1[i + 1] + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
    if L1[i] % j == 0:
        res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `res` is `L1[i] // 2 * 1`, `L1[i + 1]` satisfies 2 <= `L1[i + 1]` + 1, and either `L1[i]` is divisible by `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no else part, so no additional changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `res` is a list where the value of `L1[i] // 2 * 1` is appended if `L1[i] % j == 0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `L1[i] % j == 0` is not met, no changes are made to `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 3, `res` is a list. If `L1[i] % 3 == 0`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `L1[i] // 2 * 1` is appended to `res`. If `L1[i] % 3 != 0`, no changes are made to `res`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
