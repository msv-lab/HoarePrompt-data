Output State: **`j` is 2, `res` contains the value of `L1[i] // 2 * 1`, `L1[i]` is divisible by 2, `L1[i + 1]` satisfies 2 <= `L1[i + 1]` + 1, and `L1[i]` is divisible by 2.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `j` remains 2.
- The value of `L1[i]` is divisible by 2, so `L1[i] // j` is equivalent to `L1[i] // 2`.
- The expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` simplifies to `L1[i] // 2 * 1`, which is just `L1[i] // 2`.
- This value is appended to the list `res`.
- The conditions on `L1[i + 1]` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `L1[i]` is divisible by 2 also remains unchanged.
