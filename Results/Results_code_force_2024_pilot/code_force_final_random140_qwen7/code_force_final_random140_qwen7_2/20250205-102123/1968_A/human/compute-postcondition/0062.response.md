Output State: **`j` is 2, `res` is `L1[i] // 2 * 1`, `L1[i + 1]` satisfies \(2 \leq L1[i + 1] + 1\), `res` is appended with the value of `L1[i] // 2 * 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement without changing the values of `j`, `res`, `L1[i + 1]`, or the appended value of `L1[i] // 2 * 1`.
