Postcondition: `j` is 2, `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`, and `res` contains a value equal to `(L1[i] // 2) * 1`. This is because if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, `res` is set to `(L1[i] // 2) * 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `L1[i]` is not divisible by `j`, no change occurs to `res`.
