Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `L1` is a list with two elements, where the first element is the integer entered by the user and the second element is the integer entered by the user.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `num`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `num` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `num` must be greater than 2.
- `i` will be 3.

5. **List the final state**:
- `num` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 3.
- `L1` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

So, the final state is:

**`num` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `L1` is a list with two elements, the first element is the integer entered by the user and the second element is the integer entered by the user.**
