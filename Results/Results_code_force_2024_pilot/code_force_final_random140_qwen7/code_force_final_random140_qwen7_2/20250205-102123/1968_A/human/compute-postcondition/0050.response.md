Output State: `j` is `L1[i] + 1`, `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`, and `res` contains a series of values based on the divisors of `L1[i]` up to `L1[i]` itself.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `L1[i] + 1` because the loop iterates from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`. The variable `res` will contain a list of values where each value is calculated as `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` for each divisor `j` of `L1[i]` encountered during the loop's execution. This means that for every divisor `j` of `L1[i]` (from 2 to `L1[i]`), if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, the corresponding value `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` is appended to `res`.
