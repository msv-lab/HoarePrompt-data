Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and `num`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `num` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `L1` is a list with two elements, where the first element is an integer entered by the user and the second element is another integer entered by the user.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < num`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `num` remains unchanged because it is determined by the initial input and does not change within the loop.
   - The list `L1` is not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `L1` is a list with two elements, the first element is the integer entered by the user and the second element is the integer entered by the user.**
