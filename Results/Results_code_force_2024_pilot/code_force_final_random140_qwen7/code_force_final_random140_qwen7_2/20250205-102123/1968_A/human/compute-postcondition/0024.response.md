Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `L1[i]`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 2` to `j = L1[i] + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `num`.
   - `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user.
   - `L1[num]` must be at least 1.
   - `j` is `L1[i] + 1`.
   - `res` is a list with one element, which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `L1[i] + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `L1[i] + 2`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `L1[i] + 1`. Since `j` is now `L1[i] + 2`, it does not satisfy the condition `j <= L1[i] + 1`, and thus the loop will terminate.

5. **Final state before breaking out of the loop**:
   - `j` is `L1[i] + 2`.
   - `res` remains unchanged as it was set based on the previous value of `j`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the final state before breaking out of the loop) is:

State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1, `j` is `L1[i] + 2`, `res` is a list with one element, which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`**.
