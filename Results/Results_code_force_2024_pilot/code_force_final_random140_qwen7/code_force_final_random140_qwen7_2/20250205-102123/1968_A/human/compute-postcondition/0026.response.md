Output State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1, `j` is `L1[i] + 2`, `res` is a list with two elements, the first is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and the second is the same as the first, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables `num`, `i`, `L1`, `j`, or `res`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was in.
