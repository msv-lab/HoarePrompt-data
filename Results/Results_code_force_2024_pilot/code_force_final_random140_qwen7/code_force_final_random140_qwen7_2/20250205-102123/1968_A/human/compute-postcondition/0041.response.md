Output State: **`j` is 3, `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`, `res` contains a value equal to `(L1[i] // 2) * 1` and an additional value of `L1[i] // 3 * 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `j` remains unchanged at 3. The condition `2 <= L1[i] + 1` ensures that `L1[i]` is at least 1, which is already satisfied by the initial state. The variable `res` initially contains a value equal to `(L1[i] // 2) * 1`. After executing the line `res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))`, `res` appends a new value which is `L1[i] // 3 * 2` because `j` is 3.
