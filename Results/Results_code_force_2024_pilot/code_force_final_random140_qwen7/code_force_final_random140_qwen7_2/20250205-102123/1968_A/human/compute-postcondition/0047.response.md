Output State: **`j` is 4, `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`, `res` now contains a value equal to `(L1[i] // 4) * 3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. The values of `j`, `L1[i]`, and `res` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block we were in.
