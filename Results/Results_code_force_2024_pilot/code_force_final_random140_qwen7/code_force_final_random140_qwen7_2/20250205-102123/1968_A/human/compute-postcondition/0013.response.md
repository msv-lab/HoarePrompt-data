Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `L1[i] + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial values or conditions needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):` will execute if the condition `2 <= L1[i] + 1` is true.
   - This means `L1[i] + 1` must be at least 2, which implies `L1[i]` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the given states**:
   - We know `num` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `num`.
   - `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `L1[i]` (which is `L1[num]`) is at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `L1[num]` must be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1**
