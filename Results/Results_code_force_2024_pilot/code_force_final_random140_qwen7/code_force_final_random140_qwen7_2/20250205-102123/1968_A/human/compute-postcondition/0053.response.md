Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(2, L1[i] + 1)`. Therefore, the variables that need to be considered are `j`, `L1[i]`, and `L1[i + 1]`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: According to the initial state, `j` is set to `L1[i + 1] + 1`. However, the loop starts with `j` in the range `2` to `L1[i] + 1`. This means `j` must be initialized within this range.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `L1[i]`**: Since `j` must be in the range `2` to `L1[i] + 1`, `L1[i]` must be at least `L1[i + 1] + 1 - 1 = L1[i + 1]`. Given that `L1[i + 1]` satisfies `2 <= L1[i + 1] + 1`, it implies `L1[i + 1] >= 1`. Therefore, `L1[i]` must be at least `2`.

4. **Ensure `j` Starts in the Correct Range**: For the loop to start, `j` must be set to a value within the range `2` to `L1[i] + 1`. Initially, `j` is `L1[i + 1] + 1`, but since `L1[i + 1]` is at least `1`, `L1[i + 1] + 1` is at least `2`. Thus, `j` must be set to `2` initially if it is not already within the correct range.

5. **List `res`**: The list `res` is mentioned as containing values calculated based on the divisors of `L1[i + 1]` from 2 to `L1[i + 1] + 1`. This information is not directly relevant to the loop initialization but is part of the overall context.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` must be `2` (or within the range `2` to `L1[i] + 1`).
- `L1[i]` must be at least `2`.
- `L1[i + 1]` must satisfy `2 <= L1[i + 1] + 1`.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`j` is `2`, `L1[i]` must be at least `2`, `L1[i + 1]` must satisfy `2 <= L1[i + 1] + 1`**.
