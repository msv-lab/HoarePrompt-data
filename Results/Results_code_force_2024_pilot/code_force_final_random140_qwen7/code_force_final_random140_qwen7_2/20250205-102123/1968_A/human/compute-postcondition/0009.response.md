Output State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `L1` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are the integers entered by the user and the third element is the integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code appends an integer input (entered by the user) to the list `L1`. Since `i` is 3, the input prompt asks for the 4th entry. The initial state of `L1` is a list with two elements, which are the integers entered by the user. After appending the new input, `L1` now has three elements, each being one of the integers entered by the user. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.
