Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` as the variable iterating from `2` to `L1[i] + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being set to `L1[i] + 3`. This value of `j` is used to initialize the loop.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `L1[i] + 1`. Therefore, the initial value of `j` (which is `L1[i] + 3`) must be adjusted to ensure that the loop starts with a valid `j` value and can execute.

4. **Initial values of other relevant variables**:
   - `i` is equal to `num`.
   - `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1.
   - `j` is initially set to `L1[i] + 3`.
   - `res` is a list with three elements, each of which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, but this value is not directly relevant to the loop condition.

5. **Adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute**:
   - Since `j` is initialized to `L1[i] + 3`, and the loop will start with `j = 2`, `j` must be adjusted to be at least `2` to ensure the loop can start and execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `i` is equal to `num`.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1.
- `j` must be at least `2` to ensure the loop can start and execute.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1; `j` must be at least 2**.
