Output State: `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `num` will still hold the value it had when the loop started, `i` will be equal to `num` (since the loop increments `i` until it reaches `num`), and `L1` will be a list with `num` elements, each being an integer input by the user during the loop's iterations.
