Output State: `j` is `L1[i] + 1`, `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`, and `res` contains a list of values calculated based on the divisors of `L1[i]` from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`.

In more detail, `res` will contain a series of values where each value is calculated as `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` for each divisor `j` of `L1[i]` starting from 2 up to `L1[i] + 1`. The loop breaks once it finds a divisor, so all possible divisors are checked, and their corresponding values are appended to `res`. If `L1[i]` is not divisible by any `j` in the range, `res` will only contain the initial value `(L1[i] // 2) * 1`.
