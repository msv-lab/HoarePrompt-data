Postcondition: `j` is 3, `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`, `res` contains a value equal to `(L1[i] // 2) * 1`, and if `L1[i]` is divisible by 3, an additional value of `L1[i] // 3 * 2` is added to `res` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `L1[i]` is not divisible by 3, the original contents of `res` remain unchanged.
