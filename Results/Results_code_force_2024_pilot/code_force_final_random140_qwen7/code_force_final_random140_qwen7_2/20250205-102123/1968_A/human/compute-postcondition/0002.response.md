Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer, `L1` is an empty list, `res` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `res`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `x`, `num`, or `L1`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
