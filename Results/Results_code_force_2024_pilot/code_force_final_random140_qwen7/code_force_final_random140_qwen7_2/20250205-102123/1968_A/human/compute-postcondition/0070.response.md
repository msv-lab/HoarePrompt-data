Output State: **`j` is `L1[i + 1] + 1`, `res` is a list containing all the values calculated based on the divisors of `L1[i + 1]` from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`, and `L1[i + 1]` satisfies 2 <= `L1[i + 1]` + 1.**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `j = 2` to `j = L1[i] + 1`. For each value of `j`, it checks if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`. If it is, it appends the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res` and breaks out of the loop. This process continues until the loop completes its iterations. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time, it will eventually check all values from 2 up to `L1[i] + 1`. Therefore, the final state of `res` will contain all the values that meet the condition `L1[i] % j == 0` for `j` ranging from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`. The variable `j` will end up being `L1[i + 1] + 1` because the loop will iterate through all integers from 2 to `L1[i] + 1` and `j` will be incremented to the next integer after the last iteration. The variable `L1[i + 1]` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
