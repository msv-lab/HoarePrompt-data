Postcondition: `j` is 4, `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`. If `L1[i]` is divisible by 4, `res` contains a value equal to `(L1[i] // 4) * 3`. If `L1[i]` is not divisible by 4, `res` contains a value equal to `(L1[i] // 2) * 1` and, if `L1[i]` is also divisible by 3, an additional value of `(L1[i] // 3) * 2` is added.
