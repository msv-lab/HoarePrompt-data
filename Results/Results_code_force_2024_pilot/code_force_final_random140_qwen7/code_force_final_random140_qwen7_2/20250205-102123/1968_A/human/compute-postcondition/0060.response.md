Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 2
   - `res` is `L1[i] // 2 * 1`
   - `L1[i + 1]` satisfies \(2 \leq L1[i + 1] + 1\)
   - The loop condition is checked using `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`.
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 2 and increments by 1 until it reaches `L1[i] + 1`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

4. **New Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `j` will be 3.

5. **Other States:**
   - The other states (`res`, `L1[i + 1]`) do not change within the loop head; they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `j` should be 3.

The final state is:
State: **`j` is 3, `res` is `L1[i] // 2 * 1`, `L1[i + 1]` satisfies \(2 \leq L1[i + 1] + 1\)**
