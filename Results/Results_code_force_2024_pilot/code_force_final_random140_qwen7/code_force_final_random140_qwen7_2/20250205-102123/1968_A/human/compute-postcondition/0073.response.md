Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes two variables `t` and `x`, where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `x` is an integer within the range 2 to 1000. The function does not return any value directly but implies that it might perform some operations or checks using these variables.**

Given the constraints and the lack of specific output details in the problem statement, the focus is on understanding the nature of the input variables rather than their exact usage within the function.
