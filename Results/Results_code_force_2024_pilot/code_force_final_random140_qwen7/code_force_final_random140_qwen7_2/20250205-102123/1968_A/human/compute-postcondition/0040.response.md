Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `L1[i]`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `j` is 2
   - `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`
   - `res` contains a value equal to `(L1[i] // 2) * 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `2` to `L1[i] + 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `2` and increments by `1` in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `3`.
   - The value of `L1[i]` remains unchanged because the loop only modifies `j` and does not affect `L1[i]`.
   - The value of `res` remains unchanged unless `L1[i]` is divisible by `j` in the current iteration, but since we are not given that `L1[i]` is divisible by `3`, `res` will remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `j` is 3
- `L1[i]` remains the same (satisfying `2 <= L1[i] + 1`)
- `res` remains the same (equal to `(L1[i] // 2) * 1`)

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 3, `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`, and `res` contains a value equal to `(L1[i] // 2) * 1`**
