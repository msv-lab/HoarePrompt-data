Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num` will be the final value it was set to during the last iteration, `i` will have reached `num` (since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `num-1`), and `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each being an integer input by the user as the loop appended these inputs to the list in each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(num):
    for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
        if L1[i] % j == 0:
            res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1; `j` is `L1[i] + 3`, `res` is a list with three elements, each of which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` remains equal to `num`, as it is decremented within the loop but never reaches a value less than 0. The list `L1` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the loop. The variable `j` starts from `L1[i] + 2` and increments by 1 in each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `j` will be `L1[i] + 3`. The list `res` accumulates results from the loop, with each element being calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the respective `j` value, and contains three such elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `j` is `L1[i] + 1`, `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`, and `res` contains a list of values calculated based on the divisors of `L1[i]` from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`.

In more detail, `res` will contain a series of values where each value is calculated as `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` for each divisor `j` of `L1[i]` starting from 2 up to `L1[i] + 1`. The loop breaks once it finds a divisor, so all possible divisors are checked, and their corresponding values are appended to `res`. If `L1[i]` is not divisible by any `j` in the range, `res` will only contain the initial value `(L1[i] // 2) * 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `L1[i + 1] + 1`, `res` is a list containing all the values calculated based on the divisors of `L1[i + 1]` from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`, and `L1[i + 1]` satisfies 2 <= `L1[i + 1]` + 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
