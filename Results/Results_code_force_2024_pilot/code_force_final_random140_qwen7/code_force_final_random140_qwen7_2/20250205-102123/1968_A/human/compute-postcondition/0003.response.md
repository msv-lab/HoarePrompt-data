Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(num)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - `num` is the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Check the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `num` must be a positive integer greater than 0. This ensures that there are iterations to be performed.
   - The value of `i` will increment from 0 up to `num-1` during the loop execution.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `num` must be a positive integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
- `num` is an input integer.
- `L1` is an empty list.
- `res` is an empty list.

We only need to adjust the state of `num` to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, the state of `num` should be adjusted to be a positive integer greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num` must be a positive integer greater than 0**
