Output State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1; `res` is a list with one element, which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends to the list `res` the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Here, `i` is equal to `num`, so `L1[i]` refers to `L1[num]`. Since `L1[num]` is an element of the list and must be at least 1, the value appended to `res` is `L1[num] // j * (j - 1)`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
