Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `num`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `num` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `num`.
   - `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user.
   - `L1[num]` must be at least 1.
   - `j` is `L1[i] + 3`.
   - `res` is a list with three elements, each of which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `num`, and the loop condition is `i < num`, the loop cannot execute because `i` is not less than `num`.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed for `i` or `num` for the loop to execute one more time since the loop condition is already not met.

5. **List `L1`**: The list `L1` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the loop.

6. **Variable `j`**: `j` is defined as `L1[i] + 3`. Since `i` is `num`, `j` would be `L1[num] + 3`. However, since the loop does not execute, `j` remains unchanged from its previous value.

7. **List `res`**: The list `res` is fully populated with three elements, and no further updates are required.

Given the above analysis, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop condition is already not met.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1; `j` is `L1[i] + 3`, `res` is a list with three elements, each of which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`**.
