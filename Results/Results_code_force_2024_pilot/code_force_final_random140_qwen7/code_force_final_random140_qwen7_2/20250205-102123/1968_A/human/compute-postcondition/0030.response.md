Output State: `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1; `j` is `L1[i] + 3`, `res` is a list with three elements, each of which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` remains equal to `num`, as it is decremented within the loop but never reaches a value less than 0. The list `L1` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the loop. The variable `j` starts from `L1[i] + 2` and increments by 1 in each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `j` will be `L1[i] + 3`. The list `res` accumulates results from the loop, with each element being calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the respective `j` value, and contains three such elements.
