Output State: `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num` will be the final value it was set to during the last iteration, `i` will have reached `num` (since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `num-1`), and `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each being an integer input by the user as the loop appended these inputs to the list in each iteration.
