Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is `L1[i] + 1`
   - `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`
   - `res` contains a list of values calculated based on the divisors of `L1[i]` from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(num):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - The loop condition is `i < num`.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `L1[i] + 1`
- `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`
- `res` contains a list of values based on the divisors of `L1[i]` from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`

For the next iteration of the loop:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- We need to check if the new `i` is within the range `0 <= i < num`.

Since the loop variable `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, and the other variables (`j` and `res`) are derived from `L1[i]`, we need to update `i` accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Increment `i`:**
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

2. **Determine `j`:**
   - `j` will be `L1[i + 1] + 1`.

3. **Determine `L1[i + 1]`:**
   - `L1[i + 1]` must satisfy `2 <= L1[i + 1] + 1`.

4. **Determine `res`:**
   - `res` will be updated based on the divisors of `L1[i + 1]` from 2 to `L1[i + 1] + 1`.

### Final State:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `j` will be `L1[i + 1] + 1`.
- `L1[i + 1]` must satisfy `2 <= L1[i + 1] + 1`.
- `res` will be updated based on the divisors of `L1[i + 1]` from 2 to `L1[i + 1] + 1`.

### Answer:
State: **`j` is `L1[i + 1] + 1`, `L1[i + 1]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i + 1] + 1`, and `res` contains a list of values calculated based on the divisors of `L1[i + 1]` from 2 to `L1[i + 1] + 1`.**
