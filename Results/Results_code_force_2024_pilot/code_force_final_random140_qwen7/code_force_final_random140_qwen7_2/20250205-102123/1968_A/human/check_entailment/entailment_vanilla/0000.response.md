Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given an integer \( x \), find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- The output should be any \( y \) that satisfies the condition.

### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num` and then reads `num` integers into the list `L1`.
   - This part is correct and matches the input format.

2. **Finding \( y \):**
   - For each \( x \) in `L1`, the program attempts to find a \( y \) by iterating from 2 to \( x \).
   - It checks if \( x \% j == 0 \) (i.e., \( j \) is a divisor of \( x \)).
   - If true, it calculates \( y \) as \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) and appends this value to `res`.
   - It then breaks out of the loop, which means only the first divisor found is used.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \( y \):**
   - The formula \( y = \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - For example, for \( x = 10 \), the first divisor found is 2, so \( y = \frac{10}{2} \times (2 - 1) = 5 \). However, \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\), but we can check other values like \( y = 4 \) where \(\gcd(10, 4) + 4 = 8\), which is higher.

2. **Not Maximizing the Expression:**
   - The program does not ensure that the chosen \( y \) maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). It just uses the first divisor found, which might not be optimal.

### Example Verification:
- For \( x = 10 \), the program outputs 5, but the optimal \( y \) could be 4 since \(\gcd(10, 4) + 4 = 8\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not guarantee finding the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

**Correctness: False**
