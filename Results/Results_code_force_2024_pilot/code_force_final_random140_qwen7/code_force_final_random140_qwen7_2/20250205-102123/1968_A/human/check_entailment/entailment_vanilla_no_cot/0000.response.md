Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used to find `y` is flawed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD**: The program attempts to find a divisor `j` of `L1[i]` and then calculates `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` as a potential value for `y`. This does not necessarily maximize `\gcd(x, y) + y`.

2. **Objective Misalignment**: The goal is to maximize `\gcd(x, y) + y`, but the program does not correctly compute or maximize this value. Instead, it seems to be attempting to find a divisor-based value, which is not aligned with the objective.

To correctly solve the problem, you should:
- Compute the GCD of `x` and all possible values of `y` from 1 to `x-1`.
- Track the maximum value of `\gcd(x, y) + y` and the corresponding `y`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def find_max_gcd_y(x):
    max_value = 0
    best_y = 1
    for y in range(1, x):
        current_value = gcd(x, y) + y
        if current_value > max_value:
            max_value = current_value
            best_y = y
    return best_y

def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    for _ in range(num):
        x = int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(_ + 1) + '- '))
        y = find_max_gcd_y(x)
        print(y)

func()
```

This corrected program will correctly find and print `y` for each input `x` such that `\gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.
