You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
    print(*res, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers entered by the user. For each integer in the list, it calculates and prints the result of dividing the integer by its smallest divisor (other than 1) and then multiplying by one less than that divisor. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given an integer \( x \), find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- The program should output any valid \( y \) for each test case.

### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program asks for the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - This part seems correct as it handles multiple test cases.

2. **Finding \( y \):**
   - The program attempts to find \( y \) by iterating from 2 to \( x \) and checking if \( x \) is divisible by \( j \).
   - If \( x \% j == 0 \), it calculates \( y \) as \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) and appends it to the list `res`.
   - The program then breaks out of the inner loop after finding the first such \( y \).

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \( y \):**
   - The calculation \( y = \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - For example, for \( x = 10 \), the program might choose \( y = 5 \) (since \( 10 \% 2 == 0 \)), but the correct \( y \) should be 5 because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\), which is the maximum possible value.

2. **Maximization Logic:**
   - The program does not ensure that the chosen \( y \) maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). It just finds the first \( y \) that satisfies \( x \% j == 0 \).

### Example Analysis:
- For \( x = 10 \), the correct \( y \) should be 5 because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\).
- The provided program might choose other values like 6 (since \( 10 \% 2 == 0 \)), but \(\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 8\), which is less than 10.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the chosen \( y \) maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

### Correctness:
**False**

To fix this, the program needs to implement a proper algorithm to find the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). One approach could be to iterate through all possible \( y \) values and keep track of the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
