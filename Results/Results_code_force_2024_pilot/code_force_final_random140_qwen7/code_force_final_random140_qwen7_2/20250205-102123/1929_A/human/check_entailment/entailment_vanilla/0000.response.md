Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `ar`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `ar` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))`.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - Specifically, the expression `sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)])` computes the sum of differences `(ar[1] - ar[0]) + (ar[2] - ar[1]) + ... + (ar[n-1] - ar[n-2])`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are placed at the beginning, maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.
   - This is because the difference between two consecutive numbers in a sorted array is maximized when the smaller number comes first.

2. **Summing Differences:**
   - The sum of differences `(ar[1] - ar[0]) + (ar[2] - ar[1]) + ... + (ar[n-1] - ar[n-2])` is indeed the maximum possible beauty of the array after rearranging its elements.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
   - It correctly processes arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
