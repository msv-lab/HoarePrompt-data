You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)]))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 500) representing the number of cases, followed by an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \) (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( 10^9 \)). It then sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list, printing this sum for each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies the state by processing the input data according to the specified constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the sorting of the array. Sorting the array does not guarantee that the maximum beauty will be achieved. Instead, to maximize the beauty, we should place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest at the end, and then alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
3
2 1 3
```
The program sorts the array to `[1, 2, 3]` and calculates the beauty as `2`, which is correct for this specific case. However, consider another case:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The program sorts the array to `[54, 80, 90, 100]` and calculates the beauty as `57`. However, the correct approach would be to rearrange the array to `[100, 54, 90, 43, 80]`, which gives a beauty of `57 + 36 + 47 + 37 = 177`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
