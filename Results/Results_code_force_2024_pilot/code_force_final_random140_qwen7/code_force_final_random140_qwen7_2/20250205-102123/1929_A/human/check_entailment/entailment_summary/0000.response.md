Reasoning:
The given program aims to calculate the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. The program reads the number of test cases, the size of the array, and the array elements, sorts the array, and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify if sorting the array and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements indeed gives the maximum possible beauty for any given array.

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are placed at the beginning and the largest elements at the end. This arrangement maximizes the positive differences (since the difference between two close numbers is smaller than the difference between two far numbers).

2. **Sum of Differences**: By calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, we ensure that the differences are maximized because the sorted order naturally places the largest gaps between the smallest and largest elements.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and then summing the differences between consecutive elements.

Correctness: **True**
