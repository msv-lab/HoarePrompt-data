Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the array and then calculating the difference between consecutive elements. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible beauty of the array. 

To maximize the beauty, we should place the largest element at the beginning and the smallest at the end, and then alternate placing the next largest and smallest elements in between. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        ar.sort()
        
        # Initialize the result
        result = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum beauty
        for i in range(n // 2):
            result += ar[n - 1 - i] - ar[i]
        
        # If n is odd, add the middle element once
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result += ar[n // 2]
        
        print(result)

```

This corrected program correctly rearranges the elements to maximize the beauty of the array.
