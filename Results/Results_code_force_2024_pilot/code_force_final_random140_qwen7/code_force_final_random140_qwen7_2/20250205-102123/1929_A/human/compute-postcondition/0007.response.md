Output: **sum of differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar` (where `ar` is a sorted list of integers)**

Explanation:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, but this value is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is the length of the list `ar`, which means it is the number of elements in the sorted list `ar`.
- `ar` is a sorted list of integers, so the elements are in ascending order.
- The expression inside the print statement calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar`.

For example, if `ar = [1, 3, 6, 10]`, then the differences between consecutive elements are `[3-1, 6-3, 10-6] = [2, 3, 4]`, and their sum is `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of these differences for the given sorted list `ar`.
