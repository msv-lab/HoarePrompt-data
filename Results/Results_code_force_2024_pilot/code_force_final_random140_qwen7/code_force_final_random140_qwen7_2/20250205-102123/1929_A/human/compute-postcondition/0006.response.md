Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, sorts the resulting list, and assigns it to the variable `ar`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` remains the new input integer, and `ar` is now a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
