Output State: The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be the last input integer received, and `ar` will be a sorted list of integers obtained from the last input.

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` retains its initial value which is any integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last integer input during the loop's execution, and `ar` will contain the sorted list of integers from the last input, also received during the loop's iterations.
