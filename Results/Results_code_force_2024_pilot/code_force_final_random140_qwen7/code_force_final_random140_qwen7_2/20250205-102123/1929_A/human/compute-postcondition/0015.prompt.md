You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be the last input integer received, and `ar` will be a sorted list of integers obtained from the last input.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` retains its initial value which is any integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last integer input during the loop's execution, and `ar` will contain the sorted list of integers from the last input, also received during the loop's iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of cases, followed by n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function does not return any value explicitly but processes the input data according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
