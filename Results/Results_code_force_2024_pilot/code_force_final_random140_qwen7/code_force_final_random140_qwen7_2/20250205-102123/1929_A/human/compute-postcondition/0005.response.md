Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, and `int(input())` must be at least 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `ar`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `int(input())` must be at least 1 is already satisfied by the assignment of `n`.
