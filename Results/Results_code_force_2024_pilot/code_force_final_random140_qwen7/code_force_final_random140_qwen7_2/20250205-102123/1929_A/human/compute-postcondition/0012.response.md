Output State: The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be the last input integer received, and `ar` will be the sorted list of integers obtained from the last input.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` retains its initial value since it is not modified within the loop. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last integer input across all iterations, and `ar` will contain the sorted list of integers from the last input, as the loop processes each input independently.
