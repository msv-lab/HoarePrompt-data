Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code takes input as a space-separated list of integers, converts them to a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`, sorts this list, and assigns it to `ar`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
