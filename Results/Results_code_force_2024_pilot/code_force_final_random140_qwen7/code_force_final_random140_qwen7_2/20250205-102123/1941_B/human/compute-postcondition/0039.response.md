Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 99, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[98]`, `loop_counter` is less than 100, and `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`**.

Explanation: The line `highestNumber = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `highestNumber`. This overrides its previous value, which was the maximum value found in the specified subarray. All other variables remain unchanged.
