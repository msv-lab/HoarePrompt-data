Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `elementIndex` is within the range defined by `range(1, length - 1)`. This means `elementIndex` should be between 1 and `length - 2` (inclusive).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `elementIndex` is 98.
   - `length` is 99.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - The loop will continue if `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`, which is 98 < 99. Since this condition is true, the loop can continue.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `elementIndex` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 99.
   - `length` remains unchanged, so it stays at 99.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`elementIndex` is 99, `length` is 99**
