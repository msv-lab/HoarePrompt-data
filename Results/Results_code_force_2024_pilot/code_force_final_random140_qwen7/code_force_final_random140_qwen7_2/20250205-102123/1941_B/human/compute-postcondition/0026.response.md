Output State: `elementIndex` is 98, `length` is at least 2, and `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[98]`. `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` within this subarray.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (from `elementIndex` starting at 1 up to 98), `elementIndex` will be 98 because the loop increments `elementIndex` in each iteration until it reaches `length - 1`, which is 99 in this case but stops before reaching the last element. The variable `length` remains at least 2, as it was initially. The `highestNumber` will be the greatest value found in the subarray from the second element (`inputarray[1]`) to the second-to-last element (`inputarray[98]`). The `highestIndex` will be the index of this maximum value within this specific subarray.
