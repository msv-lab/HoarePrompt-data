Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is len(inputarray), `highestIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is less than 100.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `length` to the length of `inputarray` using the `len()` function. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
