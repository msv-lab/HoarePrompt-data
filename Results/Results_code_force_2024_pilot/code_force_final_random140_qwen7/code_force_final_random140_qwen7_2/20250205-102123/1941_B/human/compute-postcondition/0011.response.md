Output State: **`elementIndex` is 1, `length` is at least 2, `highestNumber` is less than or equal to `inputarray[elementIndex]`, `highestIndex` is 1**.

Explanation: The line `highestIndex = elementIndex` assigns the current value of `elementIndex` (which is 1) to the variable `highestIndex`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
