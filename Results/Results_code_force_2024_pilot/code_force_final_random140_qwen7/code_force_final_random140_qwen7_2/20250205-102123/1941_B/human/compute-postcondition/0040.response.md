Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 99, `highestIndex` is -1, `loop_counter` is less than 100, and `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`**.

Explanation: The line `highestIndex = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `highestIndex`. All other variables (`elementIndex`, `length`, `loop_counter`, and `newArray`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
