Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `elementIndex` is currently set to 98.
   - `length` is set to `len(inputarray)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `elementIndex` in the range from 1 to `length - 1`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to start, `elementIndex` must be within the range [1, `length - 1`).
   - Given that `elementIndex` is currently 98, we need to check if this value falls within the valid range based on the value of `length`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `elementIndex` is currently 98, we need to ensure that `length` is such that 98 is within the range [1, `length - 1`).
   - This means `length` must be greater than 98.

6. **Consider other variables**:
   - `highestIndex`, `highestNumber`, `newArray`, and `loop_counter` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `elementIndex` and `length`.

**Final State**:
State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` must be greater than 98**
