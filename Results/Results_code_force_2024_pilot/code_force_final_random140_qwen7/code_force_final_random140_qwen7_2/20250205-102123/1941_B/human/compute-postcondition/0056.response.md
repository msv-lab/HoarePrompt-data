Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 99, `highestIndex` is 1, and `highestNumber` is inputarray[1].**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `elementIndex` starting at 1 up to `length - 2`, which is 97. During each iteration, if the current `elementIndex` value in `inputarray` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` are updated to the current `elementIndex` and the corresponding array value, respectively. Given that the loop starts at 1 and goes up to 97, the smallest index (1) will be chosen as `highestIndex` if any element at index 1 is greater than or equal to the elements at indices 2 through 97. Since the loop does not reset `elementIndex` to 1 after finding a new `highestIndex`, the final `elementIndex` remains 98. However, the final `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` will be the smallest index where the condition `inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber` was last met, which is index 1 if it was ever met during the loop's execution.
