Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is len(inputarray), `highestIndex` is -1, `highestNumber` is -1, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is less than 100.**

Explanation: The line `highestIndex = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `highestIndex`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
