Output State: **`elementIndex` is 1, `highestIndex` is 1, and `highestNumber` is inputarray[99]**.

Explanation: The line `highestIndex = elementIndex` assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 1) to `highestIndex`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `elementIndex` and `highestIndex` both become 1, while `highestNumber` remains as `inputarray[99]`.
