The only variable in the loop head is `loop_counter`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop_counter`. If `loop_counter` is not equal to 100, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `loop_counter` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `loop_counter` must be less than 100.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is at least 2, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[98]`, `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` within this subarray, `loop_counter` is less than 100, and `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`**
