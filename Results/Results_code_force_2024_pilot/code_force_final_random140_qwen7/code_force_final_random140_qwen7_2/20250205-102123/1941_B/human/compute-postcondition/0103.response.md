Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 100, `highestIndex` is 99, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[99]`, `loop_counter` is 100, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, 99)`, `answers` is ['NO']**.

This means that after executing the line `answers.append('NO')`, the list `answers` now contains the element 'NO', while all other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
