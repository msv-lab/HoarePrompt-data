Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is greater than 100, `highestIndex` is 100, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[100]`, and `answers` contains 'NO'**.

The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `answers`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `answers`, we assume it was empty before this operation. After executing the line `answers.append('NO')`, the list `answers` now contains `'NO'`. The values of `elementIndex`, `length`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber` remain unchanged from their initial states.
