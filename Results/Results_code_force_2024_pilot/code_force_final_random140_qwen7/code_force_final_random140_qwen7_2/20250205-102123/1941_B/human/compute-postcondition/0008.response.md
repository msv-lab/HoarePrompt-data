Output State: **`loop_counter` must be less than 100; `length` is the length of the input array provided by input(); `highestIndex` is -1.**

Explanation: The line `highestIndex = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `highestIndex`. The values of `loop_counter` and `length` remain unchanged from their initial states.
