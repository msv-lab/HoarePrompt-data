Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 99, `highestIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `answers` contains 'YES'**.

The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `answers`. Since `answers` was not previously mentioned to contain any elements, appending `'YES'` to it means `answers` now contains `'YES'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
