Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is at least 2, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[98]`, `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` within this subarray, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `answers` list now contains 'YES'**

The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `answers`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
