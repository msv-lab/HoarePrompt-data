Output State: **`elementIndex` is 99; `highestIndex` is 99; `highestNumber` is inputarray[99]** 

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` (which is `inputarray[99]` given the initial state) to the variable `highestNumber`. The values of `elementIndex` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged from their initial state.
