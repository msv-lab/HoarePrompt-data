Output State: **`loop_counter` is 1**.

The initial state indicates that `inputarray` is a list of integers with a specific length and range for its elements. The function `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. The given code initializes `loop_counter` to 1. No other operations are performed on `loop_counter` or any other variables, so the only change is that `loop_counter` is set to 1. All other information from the initial state remains unchanged.
