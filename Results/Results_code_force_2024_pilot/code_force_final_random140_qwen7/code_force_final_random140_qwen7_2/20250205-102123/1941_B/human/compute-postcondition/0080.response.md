Output State: **`elementIndex` is 99, `length` must be greater than 99, `highestIndex` is 99, and `highestNumber` is `inputarray[99]`**

The code `highestIndex = elementIndex` updates the value of `highestIndex` to be the same as `elementIndex`. Given that `elementIndex` is 99, `highestIndex` is now also 99. All other variables remain unchanged.
