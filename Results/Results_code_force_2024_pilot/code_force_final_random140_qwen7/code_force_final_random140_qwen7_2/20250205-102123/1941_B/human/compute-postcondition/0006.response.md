Output State: **`loop_counter` must be less than 100; `length` is the length of the input array provided by input().**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the input array provided by the user using the `len()` function. The `loop_counter` variable remains unchanged and still must be less than 100. The `length` variable is assigned the length of the input array.
