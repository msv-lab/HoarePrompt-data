Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 99, `highestIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`**.

In this output state, the variables `elementIndex`, `length`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber` retain their initial values. The `newArray` variable is assigned the result of calling the function `func_1` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments. The exact values within `newArray` depend on the implementation of `func_1`.
