### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - **func_1**: This function performs the specified operation on the array. It correctly updates the elements at positions `index-1`, `index`, and `index+1`.
   - **func_2**: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. It correctly returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise.
   - **func_3**: This function uses `func_2` to check if the array can be made zero. If `func_2` returns `True`, it immediately appends 'YES' to `answers`. If not, it iterates up to 100 times, finding the highest value in the array and applying the operation `func_1` to reduce the highest value. If `func_2` returns `True` after any operation, it appends 'YES'. If no operation makes all elements zero within 100 iterations, it appends 'NO'.

3. **Logic Flow**:
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case and calls `func_3` to determine if the array can be made zero.
   - The logic for finding the highest value and applying the operation is correct.
   - The loop limit of 100 is arbitrary but ensures the program doesn't run indefinitely if the array cannot be made zero.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case correctly.

Given the above points, the program appears to handle the problem correctly according to the provided description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
