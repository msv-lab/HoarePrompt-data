Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the `func_3` function does not properly handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros through the allowed operations.

Consider the following example:
- Input: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
- Expected Output: `NO`

The program's approach is flawed because it only checks the highest value in the array and applies the operation to it repeatedly. However, this does not guarantee that all elements can be reduced to zero. For instance, in the given example, no sequence of operations can reduce the array to all zeros.

To illustrate, let's walk through the example:
1. Initial array: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
2. Highest value is 5 at index 3. Applying the operation:
   - New array: `[2, 4, 3, 3, 0]`
3. Now, the highest value is 4 at index 1. Applying the operation:
   - New array: `[1, 2, 3, 3, 0]`
4. Continue this process, but it becomes clear that the operations do not lead to all elements being zero.

Therefore, the program fails to handle certain cases correctly, leading to an incorrect output.
