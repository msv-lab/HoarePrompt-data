You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array, index):
    array[index - 1] = array[index - 1] - 1
    array[index] = array[index] - 2
    array[index + 1] = array[index + 1] - 1
    return array

#Function 2:
def func_2(arrayForSuccess):
    for x in arrayForSuccess:
        if x != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 3:
def func_3(inputarray):
    if func_2(inputarray):
        answers.append('YES')
        return
    loop_counter = 1
    while loop_counter != 100:
        length = len(inputarray)
        highestNumber = -1
        highestIndex = -1
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        if highestNumber < 0:
            answers.append('NO')
            return
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        if func_2(newArray):
            answers.append('YES')
            return
        loop_counter += 1
    answers.append('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function accepts a list of integers and processes it without returning any value. It checks if certain conditions are met using `func_2` and `func_1`. If these conditions are satisfied, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list. If not, it finds the highest number in a specific subarray of the input list, creates a new array based on this highest number, and repeats the check. If after 100 iterations, the conditions are still not met, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the `func_3` function does not properly handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros through the allowed operations.

Consider the following example:
- Input: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
- Expected Output: `NO`

The program's approach is flawed because it only checks the highest value in the array and applies the operation to it repeatedly. However, this does not guarantee that all elements can be reduced to zero. For instance, in the given example, no sequence of operations can reduce the array to all zeros.

To illustrate, let's walk through the example:
1. Initial array: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
2. Highest value is 5 at index 3. Applying the operation:
   - New array: `[2, 4, 3, 3, 0]`
3. Now, the highest value is 4 at index 1. Applying the operation:
   - New array: `[1, 2, 3, 3, 0]`
4. Continue this process, but it becomes clear that the operations do not lead to all elements being zero.

Therefore, the program fails to handle certain cases correctly, leading to an incorrect output.
