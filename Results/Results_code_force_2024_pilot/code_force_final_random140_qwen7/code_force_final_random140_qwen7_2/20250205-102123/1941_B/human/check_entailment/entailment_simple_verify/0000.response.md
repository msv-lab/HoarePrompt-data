### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to understand why the original assessment might be incorrect.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function performs the specified operation on the array:
```python
def func_1(array, index):
    array[index - 1] = array[index - 1] - 1
    array[index] = array[index] - 2
    array[index + 1] = array[index + 1] - 1
    return array
```
This function correctly implements the operation as described in the problem statement.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function checks if all elements in the array are zero:
```python
def func_2(arrayForSuccess):
    for x in arrayForSuccess:
        if x != 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function also correctly checks if all elements are zero.

#### Function `func_3`:
This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros by repeatedly applying the operation to the highest value in the array:
```python
def func_3(inputarray):
    if func_2(inputarray):
        answers.append('YES')
        return
    loop_counter = 1
    while loop_counter != 100:
        length = len(inputarray)
        highestNumber = -1
        highestIndex = -1
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        if highestNumber < 0:
            answers.append('NO')
            return
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        if func_2(newArray):
            answers.append('YES')
            return
        loop_counter += 1
    answers.append('NO')
```
Here's the key issue with the original assessment:
1. **Infinite Loop**: The `while` loop runs up to 100 iterations. This ensures that the function does not get stuck in an infinite loop even if the array cannot be reduced to all zeros.
2. **Checking All Elements**: The function checks if all elements are zero after each operation. If they are, it immediately returns 'YES'.
3. **Handling Cases**: The function correctly identifies when it cannot reduce the array to all zeros by checking the highest value and applying the operation. If the highest value is less than zero, it returns 'NO'.

Given these points, the function `func_3` should work correctly for the problem statement. It ensures that the array is checked thoroughly and handles edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion

The original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. The provided code does indeed handle the problem correctly by ensuring that the array is checked thoroughly and by breaking out of the loop if it cannot be reduced to all zeros.

Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
