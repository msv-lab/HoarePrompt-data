Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if we can make all elements of an array equal to zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and reducing three elements: \(a_{i-1}\) by 1, \(a_i\) by 2, and \(a_{i+1}\) by 1.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function applies the operation described in the problem statement. It correctly reduces the specified elements in the array.
   - **func_2**: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. It correctly returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise.
   - **func_3**: This function is the core logic for solving the problem. It uses `func_2` to check if the array is already zero and `func_1` to apply the operation. The function iteratively finds the highest number in the array (excluding the first and last elements) and applies the operation until either all elements become zero or it reaches a maximum of 100 iterations.

3. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The algorithm in `func_3` correctly identifies the highest number in the array (excluding the first and last elements) and applies the operation to reduce the array towards zero.
   - The iterative approach ensures that the operation is applied multiple times, potentially leading to all elements becoming zero.
   - The condition of stopping after 100 iterations prevents infinite loops and provides a reasonable upper bound for the solution.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already zero, `func_2` correctly returns `True`.
   - If no combination of operations can reduce the array to zero within 100 iterations, `func_3` correctly identifies this and returns `False`.

Given the analysis, the provided functions collectively meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
