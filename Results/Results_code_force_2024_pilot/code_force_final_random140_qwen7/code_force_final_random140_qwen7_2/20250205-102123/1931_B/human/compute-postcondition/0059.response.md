Output State: **`i` is 6; `current_balance` is increased by `a[6] - target`; `possible` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. Therefore, the values of `i`, `current_balance`, and `possible` remain unchanged.
