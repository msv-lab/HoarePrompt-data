Output State: **`i` is `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `possible` is `True`, `t` is `1`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts them into a list of integers. This updates the list `a`. All other variables (`i`, `current_balance`, `possible`, `t`, `total_water`, `target`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
