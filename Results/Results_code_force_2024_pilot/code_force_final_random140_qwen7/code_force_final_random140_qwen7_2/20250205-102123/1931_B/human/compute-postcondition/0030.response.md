Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 4.
   - `current_balance` is defined as `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target + a[3] - target`. Here, `target` is not explicitly given, but it is used in the formula for `current_balance`.
   - `possible` is explicitly given as `True`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

3. **Output**:
   - The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
