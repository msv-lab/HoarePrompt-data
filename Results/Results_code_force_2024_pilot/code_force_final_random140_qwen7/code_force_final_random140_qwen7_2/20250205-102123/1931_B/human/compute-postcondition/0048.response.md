Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `current_balance` is `a[4] - target`, `possible` is False, `t` is `t-1`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, and if `current_balance < 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
