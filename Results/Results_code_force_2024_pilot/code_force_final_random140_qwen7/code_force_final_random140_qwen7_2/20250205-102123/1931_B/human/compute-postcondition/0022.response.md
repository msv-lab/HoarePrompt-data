Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `current_balance` is `a[1] - target`
   - `possible` is False
   - If `current_balance` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`.
   - The value of `current_balance` and `possible` do not change within the loop head; they are modified inside the loop body, so these values remain the same unless explicitly changed in the loop head, which is not the case here.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, so `n` must still satisfy this condition. However, since no specific value for `n` is given, we assume `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `current_balance` is `a[1] - target`, `possible` is False, and if `current_balance` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
