Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, meaning the loop has completed and `i` equals `n`.
- `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `possible` is `True`.
- `t` is `t-1`.
- `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
- `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.
- `target` is `total_water // n`.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
