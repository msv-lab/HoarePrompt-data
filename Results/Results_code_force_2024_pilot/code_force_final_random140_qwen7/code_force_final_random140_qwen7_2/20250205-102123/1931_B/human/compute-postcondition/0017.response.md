Output State: **`i` is 2, `current_balance` is `a[1] - target`, `possible` is False**

Explanation: The code updates `current_balance` by adding `a[i] - target` to its current value. Initially, `i` is 1, so `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The `current_balance` is updated to `a[0] - target + (a[1] - target)`, which simplifies to `a[1] - target`. The values of `possible` and `n` remain unchanged.
