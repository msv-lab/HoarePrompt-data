Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `possible` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the condition `current_balance < 0` was ever met during any iteration, `t` is `0` since it starts from the value of the input integer `t` and decreases by `1` with each iteration until it reaches `0`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, and `target` is `total_water // n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `current_balance` will hold the final balance calculated after processing all elements in list `a`, `possible` will indicate whether it was possible to distribute the water such that no one has a negative balance, `t` will be `0` as all inputs have been processed, and the other variables (`a`, `total_water`, and `target`) will retain their last computed values.
