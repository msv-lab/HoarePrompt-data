Output State: **`i` is 5; `current_balance` is `current_balance + a[5] - target`; `possible` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `current_balance`, and `possible`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional statement is mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the context where these variables are defined.
