Output State: **`i` is 1, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target`, `n` is the same as before, `possible` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `i` is 1, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target`, `n` is the same as before, and `possible` is False. The values of these variables remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
