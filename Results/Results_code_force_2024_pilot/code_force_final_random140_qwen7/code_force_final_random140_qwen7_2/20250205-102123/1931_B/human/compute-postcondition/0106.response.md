Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each `t`, it further processes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) followed by `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. The function then determines and returns whether for each test case, the given conditions are met.**
