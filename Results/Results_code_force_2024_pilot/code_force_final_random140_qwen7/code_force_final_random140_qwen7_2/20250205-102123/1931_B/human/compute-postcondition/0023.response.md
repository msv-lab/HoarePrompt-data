Output State: **`i` is 3, `current_balance` is `a[1] - target + a[3] - target`, `possible` is False.**

Explanation: The code updates `current_balance` by adding `a[i] - target` to its current value. Given that `i` is initially 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]`. Therefore, `current_balance` becomes `a[1] - target + a[3] - target`. The values of `possible` and the initial condition that if `current_balance` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement remain unchanged.
