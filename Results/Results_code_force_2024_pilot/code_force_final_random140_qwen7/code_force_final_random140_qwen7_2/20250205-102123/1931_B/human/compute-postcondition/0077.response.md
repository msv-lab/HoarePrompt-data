Output State: **`current_balance` is 0, `i` is `n`, `possible` is `True`, `t` is `1`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `possible` is `True`**.

Explanation: The line `possible = True` simply reassigns the variable `possible` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.
