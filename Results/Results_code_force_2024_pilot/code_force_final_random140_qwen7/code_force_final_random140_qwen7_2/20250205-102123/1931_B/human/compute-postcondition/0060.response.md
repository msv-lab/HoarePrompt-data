Postcondition: `i` is 6, `current_balance` is increased by `a[6] - target`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If `current_balance` is not less than 0, then no change occurs to `possible` and the loop or if statement continues as normal.
