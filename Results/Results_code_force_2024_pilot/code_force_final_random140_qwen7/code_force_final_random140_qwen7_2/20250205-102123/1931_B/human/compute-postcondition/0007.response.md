Output State: **`current_balance` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `possible` is True.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `possible`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
