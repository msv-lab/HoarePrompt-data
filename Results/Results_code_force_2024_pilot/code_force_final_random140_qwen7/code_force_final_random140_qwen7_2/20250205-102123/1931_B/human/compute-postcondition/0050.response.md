Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `current_balance` is `a[4] - target`
   - `possible` is False
   - `t` is `t-1`
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user
   - `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`
   - `target` is `total_water // n`

3. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 5.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 5.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 (no change needed as it already satisfies this condition).

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `i` is 5
- `n` must be greater than 0

The other variables (`current_balance`, `possible`, `t`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 0**
