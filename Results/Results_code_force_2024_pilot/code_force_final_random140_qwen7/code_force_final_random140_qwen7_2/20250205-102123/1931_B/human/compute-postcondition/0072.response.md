Output State: **`i` is `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `possible` is `True`, `t` is `1`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` but does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state.
