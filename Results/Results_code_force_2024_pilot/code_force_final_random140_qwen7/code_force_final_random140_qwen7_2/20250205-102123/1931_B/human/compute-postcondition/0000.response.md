Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The initial condition specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). After executing the code, `t` retains this property. The other information about `n` and the array `a` remains unchanged and is still valid, but since no code has been executed to modify them, they are not included in the updated state.
