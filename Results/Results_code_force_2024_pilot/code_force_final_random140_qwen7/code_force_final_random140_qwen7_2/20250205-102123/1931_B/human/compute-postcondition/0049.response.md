Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `current_balance` is `a[4] - target`
   - `possible` is False
   - `t` is `t-1`
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user
   - `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`
   - `target` is `total_water // n`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 5`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 5
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged from the previous iteration)
   - `current_balance` remains `a[4] - target` (unchanged from the previous iteration)
   - `possible` remains False (unchanged from the previous iteration)
   - `t` is `t-1` (unchanged from the previous iteration)
   - `a` remains the same list of integers (unchanged from the previous iteration)
   - `total_water` remains the sum of all elements in list `a` (unchanged from the previous iteration)
   - `target` remains `total_water // n` (unchanged from the previous iteration)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 0, `current_balance` is `a[4] - target`, `possible` is False, `t` is `t-1`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`**.
