Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. This means the loop variable is an underscore `_`, and it iterates `t` times. However, since the underscore is a placeholder and does not represent a specific variable, we focus on the loop control variable `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4.
   - `current_balance` is calculated as `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target + a[3] - target`.
   - `possible` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, and no specific changes to `t` are mentioned, we assume `t` decreases by 1 after each iteration.
   - Therefore, if `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `t-1` at the start of the next iteration.

Given that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, and assuming `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to decrease `t` by 1.

**Final State**:
- `i` remains 4 (since `i` is not involved in the loop control).
- `current_balance` remains the same (since it is not affected by the loop).
- `possible` remains unchanged.
- `t` is decreased by 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 4, `current_balance` is a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target + a[3] - target, `possible` remains unchanged, `t` is t-1**
