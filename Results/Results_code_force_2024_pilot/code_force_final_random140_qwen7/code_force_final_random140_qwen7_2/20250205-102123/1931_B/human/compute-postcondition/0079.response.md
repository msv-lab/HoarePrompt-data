Output State: **`i` is 0; `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`**

Explanation: The variable `current_balance` is updated by adding the value of `a[i] - target` to its current value. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. Since no specific value for `a[0]` or `target` is given, the updated value of `current_balance` is expressed as `a[0] - target`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only updates `current_balance`.
