Output State: **`i` is 1, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target`, `n` is the same as before, `possible` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The code updates `current_balance` by adding `a[i] - target` to its current value. Given that `i` is initially 1, `current_balance` is updated to `a[0] - target + a[1] - target`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `possible` remain unchanged.
