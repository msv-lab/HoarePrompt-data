Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `current_balance` is `a[4] - target`, `possible` is True, `t` is t-1, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is total_water // n**

Explanation: The code updates `current_balance` by adding the difference between `a[i]` and `target`. Given that `i` is initially 4, `current_balance` is updated to `a[4] - target`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
