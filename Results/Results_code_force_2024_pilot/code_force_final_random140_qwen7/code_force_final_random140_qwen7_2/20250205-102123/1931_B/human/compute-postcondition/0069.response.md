Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `possible` is `True` since the condition inside the if statement is `possible`, `t` is `t-1`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`.
