Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**: 
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` will be 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `current_balance`: This variable is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `i`: The loop starts with `i` being 0.
   - `n`: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.
   - `possible`: This variable is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `t`: This variable is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `a`: This list is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `total_water`: This variable is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `target`: This variable is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Given these points, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
