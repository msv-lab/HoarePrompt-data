Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `possible` is True if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop, otherwise `possible` remains False; `t` is `t-1`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`
