Postcondition: `i` is 1, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target`, `n` is the same as before, `possible` remains unchanged. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `current_balance` is not less than 0, then no changes are made to `possible`.
