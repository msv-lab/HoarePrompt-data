Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `total_water` divided by `n` (using integer division) to the variable `target`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `total_water` remain unchanged from their initial states.
