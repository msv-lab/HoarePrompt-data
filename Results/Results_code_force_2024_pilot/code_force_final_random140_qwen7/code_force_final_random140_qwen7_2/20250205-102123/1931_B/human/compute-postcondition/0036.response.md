Output State: **`i` is 4, `current_balance` is a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target + a[3] - target, `possible` remains unchanged, `t` is t-1, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. The original values of `i`, `current_balance`, `possible`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged. The new list `a` is created based on the input provided by the user.
