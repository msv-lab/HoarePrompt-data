Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `current_balance` is `a[4] - target`, `possible` is False, `t` is t-1, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is total_water // n, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block it is placed in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values, and the only change is that the loop or conditional block is exited.
