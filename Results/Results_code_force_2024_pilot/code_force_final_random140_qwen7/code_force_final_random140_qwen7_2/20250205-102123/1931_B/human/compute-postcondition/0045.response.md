Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `current_balance` is `a[4] - target`, `possible` is False, `t` is t-1, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is total_water // n, and the current value of `current_balance` is less than 0.**

The code sets the variable `possible` to `False`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
