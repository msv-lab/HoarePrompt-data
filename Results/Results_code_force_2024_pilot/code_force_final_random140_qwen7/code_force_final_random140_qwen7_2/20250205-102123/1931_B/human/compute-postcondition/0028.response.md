Output State: **i is 4, current_balance is a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target + a[3] - target, and possible is False.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (from 0 to n-1), the value of `i` will be `n`. In this case, since `n` is given as an input integer, `i` will be `n-1` plus one, which is `n`. The `current_balance` will be the sum of `a[i] - target` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, which is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + ... + a[n-1] - target`. Given that the loop breaks when `current_balance` becomes less than 0, and it is stated that `possible` is False after the first iteration, it remains False after all iterations.
