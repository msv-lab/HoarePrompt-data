Output State: **`i` is 4, `current_balance` is a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target + a[3] - target, `possible` remains unchanged, `t` is t-1, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `total_water`. The values of `i`, `current_balance`, `possible`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
