Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 4.
- `current_balance` is calculated as `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target + a[3] - target`. However, the values of `a` and `target` are not specified.
- `possible` is explicitly given as `False`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
