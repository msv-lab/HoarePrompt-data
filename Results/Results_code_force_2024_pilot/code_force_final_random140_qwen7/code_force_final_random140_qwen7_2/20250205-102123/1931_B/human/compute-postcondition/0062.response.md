Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `possible` is False if `current_balance` was less than 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise `possible` remains True; `t` is `t-1`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`**.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n`.
- The variable `current_balance` will be the cumulative balance calculated as `a[i] - target` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `possible` will be False if at any point during the loop `current_balance` became less than 0, otherwise it will remain True.
- The variables `t`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` will retain their values from the initial state since they are not modified within the loop.
