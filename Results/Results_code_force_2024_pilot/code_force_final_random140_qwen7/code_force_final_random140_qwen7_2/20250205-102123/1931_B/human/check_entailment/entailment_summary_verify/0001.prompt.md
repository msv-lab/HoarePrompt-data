You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_water = sum(a)
        target = total_water // n
        current_balance = 0
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            current_balance += a[i] - target
            if current_balance < 0:
                possible = False
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of sub-cases), an integer `n` (number of non-negative integers), and a list of `n` non-negative integers `a`. It calculates whether it is possible to distribute the total amount of water represented by the sum of `a` equally among `n` people without any person having a negative balance. If such a distribution is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine if we can make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another.
2. **Key Insight**: Since the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by \(n\), the target amount of water in each container would be the total amount of water divided by \(n\).
3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers \(n\) and the initial amounts of water in each container.
   - It calculates the target amount of water per container, which is the total amount of water divided by \(n\).
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a balance variable `current_balance` to check if it's possible to reach the target without any negative balance.
   - If at any point `current_balance` becomes negative, it means it's not possible to achieve the target distribution, and the program sets `possible` to `False`.
   - Finally, it prints 'YES' if `possible` is still `True`, otherwise 'NO'.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
