Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine if we can make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another.
2. **Key Insight**: Since the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by \(n\), the target amount of water in each container would be the total amount of water divided by \(n\).
3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers \(n\) and the initial amounts of water in each container.
   - It calculates the target amount of water per container, which is the total amount of water divided by \(n\).
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a balance variable `current_balance` to check if it's possible to reach the target without any negative balance.
   - If at any point `current_balance` becomes negative, it means it's not possible to achieve the target distribution, and the program sets `possible` to `False`.
   - Finally, it prints 'YES' if `possible` is still `True`, otherwise 'NO'.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
