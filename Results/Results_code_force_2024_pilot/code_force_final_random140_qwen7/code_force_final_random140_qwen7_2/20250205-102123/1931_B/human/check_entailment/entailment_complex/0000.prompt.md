Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

# Annotated Program:

    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the second line contains n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        total_water = sum(a)
        
        target = total_water // n
        
        current_balance = 0
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_balance += a[i] - target
            if current_balance < 0:
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `possible` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the condition `current_balance < 0` was ever met during any iteration, `t` is `0` since it starts from the value of the input integer `t` and decreases by `1` with each iteration until it reaches `0`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, and `target` is `total_water // n`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `current_balance` will hold the final balance calculated after processing all elements in list `a`, `possible` will indicate whether it was possible to distribute the water such that no one has a negative balance, `t` will be `0` as all inputs have been processed, and the other variables (`a`, `total_water`, and `target`) will retain their last computed values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of sub-cases), an integer `n` (number of non-negative integers), and a list of `n` non-negative integers `a`. It calculates whether it is possible to distribute the total amount of water represented by the sum of `a` equally among `n` people without any person having a negative balance. If such a distribution is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
