Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case. It handles all given examples and edge cases such as when `a` is less than `b`, when `a` is equal to `b`, and when `a` is greater than `b`. Since the program processes each test case correctly without any issues, it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
