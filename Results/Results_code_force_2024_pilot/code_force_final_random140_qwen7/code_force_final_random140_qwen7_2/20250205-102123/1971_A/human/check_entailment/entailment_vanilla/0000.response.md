Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then iterates `n` times, reading pairs of integers `(a, b)` from the input.
3. For each pair `(a, b)`, it checks which of the two numbers is smaller and prints the smaller one followed by the larger one.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
- It correctly reads pairs of integers `(a, b)` for each test case.
- The logic inside the loop is designed to print the minimum value followed by the maximum value:
  - If `a < b`, it prints `a` followed by `b`.
  - If `a > b`, it prints `b` followed by `a`.
  - If `a == b`, it prints `a` followed by `b`.

This logic ensures that the minimum value is always printed first, followed by the maximum value, regardless of whether the values are equal or not.

### Example Walkthrough:

- For the input `1 9`, the program prints `1 9` because `1 < 9`.
- For the input `8 4`, the program prints `4 8` because `4 < 8`.
- For the input `1 4`, the program prints `1 4` because `1 < 4`.
- For the input `3 4`, the program prints `3 4` because `3 < 4`.
- For the input `2 0`, the program prints `0 2` because `0 < 2`.
- For the input `2 4`, the program prints `2 4` because `2 < 4`.
- For the input `6 9`, the program prints `6 9` because `6 < 9`.
- For the input `3 3`, the program prints `3 3` because `3 == 3`.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
