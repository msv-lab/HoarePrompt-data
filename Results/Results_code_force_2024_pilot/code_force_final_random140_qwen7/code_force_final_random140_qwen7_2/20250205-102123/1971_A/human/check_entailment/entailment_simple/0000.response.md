Reasoning:
1. The problem requires the program to process multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \(x\) and \(y\).
2. The program should output the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) followed by the maximum of \(x\) and \(y\) for each test case.
3. The annotated program correctly initializes variables and processes each test case using a loop.
4. Inside the loop, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\) from the input, compares them, and prints the smaller one followed by the larger one. This logic matches the requirements of the problem.
5. The program handles all possible cases: when \(a < b\), \(a > b\), and \(a = b\).

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
