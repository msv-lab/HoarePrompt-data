Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the initial states**: At the end of the previous iteration, the states are:
   - `t` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `b` is an input integer

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after the increment in the loop, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` becomes 1
- `n` must be greater than 1

The final state before the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
