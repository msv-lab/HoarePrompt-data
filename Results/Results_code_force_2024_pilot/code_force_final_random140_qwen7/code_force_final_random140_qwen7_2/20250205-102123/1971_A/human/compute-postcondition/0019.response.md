Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer

The `print(a, b)` statement will print the values of `a` and `b`.

Since `a` and `b` are explicitly defined as input integers, their values are derived from user inputs.

Output: **a, b (where a and b are the input integers)**
