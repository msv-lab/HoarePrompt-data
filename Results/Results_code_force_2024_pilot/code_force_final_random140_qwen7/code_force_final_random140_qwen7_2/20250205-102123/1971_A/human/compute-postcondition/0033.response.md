Output State: **The final output state will be as follows: `t` remains 0, `n` remains an input integer which must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers inputted during the loop. Regardless of the values of `a` and `b`, they are printed in ascending order if `a` is less than `b`, or in their original order if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` has not been modified and still holds its initial value of 0. The variable `n` retains its initial value provided by the input, and it must have been greater than 0 for the loop to run. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered during the loop's execution, and they will be printed in the correct order based on their comparison.
