Output: **a b (where a and b are the integers from the input split by space)**

Explanation:
- `t` is initially set to 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1 but its exact value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `a` and `b` are defined as integers from the input split by space. Since the input integers are split and assigned to `a` and `b`, the print statement will output these two integers separated by a space.
