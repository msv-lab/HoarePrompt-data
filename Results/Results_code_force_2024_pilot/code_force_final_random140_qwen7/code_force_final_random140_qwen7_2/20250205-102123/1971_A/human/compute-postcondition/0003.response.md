Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `a` and `b` respectively. The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` is still 0, `n` must still be greater than 0, `i` must still be 0, and now `a` and `b` are the input integers.
