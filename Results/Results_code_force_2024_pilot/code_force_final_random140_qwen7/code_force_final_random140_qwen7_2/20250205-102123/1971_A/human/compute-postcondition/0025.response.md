Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
