Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input split by space

The `print(b, a)` statement will print the values of `b` and `a`. Since `a` and `b` are integers from the input split by space, they will be printed in the order they appear in the input.

Output: **b, a**
