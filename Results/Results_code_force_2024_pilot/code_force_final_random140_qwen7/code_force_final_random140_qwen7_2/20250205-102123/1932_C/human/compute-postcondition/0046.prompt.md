Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' in string `t`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q1` is either `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is either `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `y` is a string representation of `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y += ' ' + str(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' in string `t`, `k` is updated based on the last character of `t`: if the last character is 'R', `k` is `a[l] * a[l + 1] % m`; if the last character is 'L', `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, where `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is not 'L'; `q2` is either `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L'; `y` is `y` plus a space followed by the string representation of `k`, and `i` is greater than or equal to `-1` if the last character of `t` is 'R', or less than `-1` if the last character of `t` is 'L'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' in string `t`, `k` is updated based on the last character of `t`, `q1` and `q2` are defined based on the last character of `t`, `y` is `y` plus a space followed by the string representation of `k`, and `i` is greater than or equal to `-1` if the last character of `t` is 'R', or less than `-1` if the last character of `t` is 'L'. If the last character of `t` is 'R', `q2` is increased by 1 and `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`. If the last character of `t` is 'L', `q1` is decreased by 1 and `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`; `y` is `y` plus a space followed by the string representation of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - 4`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' in string `t`, `k` is updated based on the last character of `t`, `q1` and `q2` are defined based on the last character of `t`, `y` is `y` plus a space followed by the string representation of `k * a[q2] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'R', or `k * a[q1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', and `i` is greater than or equal to `-1` if the last character of `t` is 'R', or less than `-1` if the last character of `t` is 'L'; `y` is now `y` plus a space followed by the string representation of `k * a[q2] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'R', or `k * a[q1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
