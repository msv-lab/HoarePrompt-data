Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `ii` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' in string `t`, `q1` is either `l - 2` or `l - 1`, `q2` is either `l` or `l + 1`, `y` is an empty string, `t` is the input string. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`; otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`.
