Output State: **`i` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m` or `k * a[q2] % m` depending on whether `t[i]` equals 'R' or not, `y` is a string containing a space followed by the value of `k` converted to a string.**

Explanation: The code `y += ' ' + str(k)` appends a space followed by the string representation of `k` to the existing value of `y`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `t[i]` are unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` remains either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is updated as described, and `y` now includes the new value appended to its previous content.
