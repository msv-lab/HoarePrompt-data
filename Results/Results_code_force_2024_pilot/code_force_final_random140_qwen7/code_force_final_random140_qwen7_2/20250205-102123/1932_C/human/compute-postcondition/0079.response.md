Output State: **`i` is either `n-4` or `n-3`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', `q2` is increased by 1, `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k * a[q2-1] % m` converted to a string**

Explanation: The code `q2 += 1` increments the value of `q2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` remains either `n-4` or `n-3`, `k` remains updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', and `y` remains a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k * a[q2-1] % m` converted to a string.
