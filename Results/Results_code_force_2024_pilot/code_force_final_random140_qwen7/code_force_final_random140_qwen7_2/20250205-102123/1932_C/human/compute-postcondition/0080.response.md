Output State: **`i` is either `n-4` or `n-3`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k` converted to a string, `k` is now `k * a[q1] % m`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` by multiplying it with `a[q1]` modulo `m`. The values of `i`, `t`, `q1`, and `y` remain unchanged from their previous states. Specifically, `i` remains either `n-4` or `n-3`, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', and `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k` converted to a string. The new value of `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`.
