Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k * a[q2] % m`, `q2` is `q2 + 1`, the current value of `t[i]` is 'R'**

Explanation: The code `q2 += 1` increments the value of `q2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains `n - 2`, `k` remains `k * a[q2] % m`, `q2` becomes `q2 + 1`, and the value of `t[i]` remains 'R'.
