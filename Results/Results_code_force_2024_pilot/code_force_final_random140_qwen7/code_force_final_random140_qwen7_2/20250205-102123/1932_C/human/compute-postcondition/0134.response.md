Output State: **`i` is `n - 5`; `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m`; `y` is a string containing a space followed by the value of the updated `k` converted to a string; `q1` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `q1 -= 1` decrements the value of `q1` by 1. The values of `i`, `k`, and `y` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` is still `n - 5`, `k` is still updated as `k * a[q1] % m`, and `y` is still a string containing a space followed by the value of the updated `k` converted to a string. The only change is that `q1` is now one less than its previous value.
