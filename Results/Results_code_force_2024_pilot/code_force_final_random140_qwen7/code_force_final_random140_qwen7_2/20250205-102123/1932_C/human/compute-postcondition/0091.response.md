Postcondition: `i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `k` is updated to either `k * a[q1] % m` or `k * a[q2] % m` depending on whether `t[i]` is 'R' or not, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', `q2` is increased by 1 if `t[i]` is 'R', `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k * a[q2-1] % m` or `k` converted to a string, and `y` is updated by adding a space followed by the current value of `k` converted to a string.
