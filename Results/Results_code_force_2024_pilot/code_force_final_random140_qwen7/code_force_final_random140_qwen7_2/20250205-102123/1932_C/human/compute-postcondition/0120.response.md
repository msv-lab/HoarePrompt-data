Postcondition: `i` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m` or `k * a[q2] % m` depending on whether `t[i]` equals 'R' or not. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `i` remains `n - 2`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, and `q2` is incremented by 1. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then `i` becomes `n - 3`.
