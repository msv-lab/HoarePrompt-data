Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `t = input()` assigns the value of the next input to the variable `t`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `n` and `m` are integers from the input, while `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting a string input and converting each element to an integer. After executing the code, `t` now holds the value of the input, while `n`, `m`, and `a` retain their original descriptions.
