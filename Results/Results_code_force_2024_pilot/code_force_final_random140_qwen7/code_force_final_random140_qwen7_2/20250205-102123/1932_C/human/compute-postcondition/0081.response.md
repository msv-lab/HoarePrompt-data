Output State: **`i` is either `n-4` or `n-3`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is decreased by 1, `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k` converted to a string, `k` is now `k * a[q1] % m`.**

Explanation: The code `q1 -= 1` decreases the value of `q1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state of `q1` is one less than its previous value, while `i`, `k`, and `y` retain their previous values.
