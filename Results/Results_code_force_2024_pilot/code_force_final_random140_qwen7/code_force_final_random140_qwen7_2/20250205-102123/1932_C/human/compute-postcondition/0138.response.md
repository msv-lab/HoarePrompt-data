Output State: **i is -1, k is the final value of k after all iterations, q1 is l-1, q2 is l, y is a string containing spaces followed by the value of k converted to a string for each iteration, and ii is 0.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will decrement from `n-2` to `-1`. The variable `k` will be updated based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration. The variable `q1` starts at `l-2` or `l-1` and decreases by 1 each time the condition `t[i] != 'R'` is met. Conversely, `q2` starts at `l` or `l+1` and increases by 1 each time the condition `t[i] == 'R'` is met. The variable `y` accumulates the string representation of `k` after each iteration, and remains unchanged in terms of its structure but contains the updated values of `k`. The variable `ii` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
