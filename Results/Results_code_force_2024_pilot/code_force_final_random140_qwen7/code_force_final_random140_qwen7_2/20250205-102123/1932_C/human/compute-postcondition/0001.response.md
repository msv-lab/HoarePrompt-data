Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
