Output State: **`i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', `q2` is increased by 1 if `t[i]` is 'R', `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k * a[q2-1] % m` or `k` converted to a string, and `y` is updated by adding a space followed by the current value of `k` converted to a string.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`.
- The states of `i`, `t[i]`, `q1`, `q2`, and `y` remain as they were before the code execution, except for `k` which is now updated.
- `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R'.
- `q2` is increased by 1 if `t[i]` is 'R'.
- `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k * a[q2-1] % m` or `k` converted to a string, and it is updated by adding a space followed by the current value of `k` converted to a string.
