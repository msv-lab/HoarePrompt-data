Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' in string `t`, `k` is updated based on the last character of `t`: if the last character is 'R', `k` is `a[l] * a[l + 1] % m`; if the last character is 'L', `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, where `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is not 'L'; `q2` is either `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L'; `y` is a string representation of `k`, and `i` is greater than or equal to `-1` if the last character of `t` is 'R', or less than `-1` if the last character of `t` is 'L'.**
