Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k * a[q2] % m`, `q2` is `q2 + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `t[i]` is 'R'.**

Explanation: The code increments `q2` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `n - 2`, `k` remains as `k * a[q2] % m`, `q2` is now `q2 + 1`, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `t[i]` is still 'R'.
