Postcondition: `i` is `n - 5`, `k` is updated according to the condition in the if statement: if `t[i] == 'R'`, then `k` is updated as `k * a[q2] % m * a[q2] % m` with `q2` increased by 1; otherwise, `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m`. `y` is a string containing a space followed by the value of the updated `k` converted to a string. Additionally, if the if condition is true (`t[i] == 'R'`), `q2` is increased by 1; otherwise, `q1` is decreased by 1.
