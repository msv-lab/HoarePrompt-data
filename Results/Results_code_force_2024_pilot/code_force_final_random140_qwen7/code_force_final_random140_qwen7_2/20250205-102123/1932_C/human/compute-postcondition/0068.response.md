Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k * a[q2] % m`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `t[i]` is 'R'.**

In this output state, the variable `i` retains its initial value of `n - 2`. The variable `k` is updated to the value of `k` multiplied by `a[q2]` modulo `m`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 1. Lastly, the value of `t[i]` remains 'R', which was its initial state.
