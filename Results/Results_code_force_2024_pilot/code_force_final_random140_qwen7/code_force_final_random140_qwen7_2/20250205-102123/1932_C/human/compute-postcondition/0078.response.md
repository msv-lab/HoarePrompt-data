Output State: **`i` is either `n-4` or `n-3`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k * a[q2] % m` converted to a string**

Explanation:
- The variable `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`.
- The value of `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R'.
- The value of `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the new value of `k` (which is now `k * a[q2] % m`) converted to a string.
- The initial values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged in terms of their specific values, but `k` now holds the updated value.
