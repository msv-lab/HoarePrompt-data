Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, `q1`, and `y`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means it starts at `n-2` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `n-3` or `n-2`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. Therefore, `i` will be `n-3` or `n-2` (depending on the previous iteration) and will be decremented by 1.
   - **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - **`q1`**: If `t[i]` is not 'R', `q1` is decreased by 1. Since we don't know the exact value of `t[i]` from the previous iteration, we consider both possibilities.
   - **`y`**: The string `y` is updated to include a space followed by the value of `k` converted to a string. Since `k` is updated based on the value of `a[q1]`, and `y` is updated each time through the loop, we need to update `y` based on the most recent value of `k`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- If `i` was `n-3` in the previous iteration, it will now be `n-4`.
- If `i` was `n-2` in the previous iteration, it will now be `n-3`.

Since `q1` could have been decreased by 1 if `t[i]` was not 'R', we need to consider both cases.

The final state before the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `n-4` if it was `n-3` previously, or `n-3` if it was `n-2` previously.
- `q1` will be `q1 - 1` if `t[i]` was not 'R' in the previous iteration.
- `y` will be updated to include the current value of `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is either `n-4` or `n-3`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` or `k * a[q2] % m` depending on whether `t[i]` is 'R' or not, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k` converted to a string**.
