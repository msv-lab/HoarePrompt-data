Output State: **`i` is `n - 5`, `k` is updated as `k * a[q2] % m * a[q2] % m` with `q2` increased by 1, `y` is a string containing a space followed by the value of the updated `k` converted to a string.**

Explanation: The code updates `k` to `k * a[q2] % m * a[q2] % m`. This means that `k` was previously updated as either `k * a[q1] % m` with `q1` decreased by 1 or `k * a[q2] % m * a[q2] % m` with `q2` increased by 1. Since the current code specifies `k = k * a[q2] % m * a[q2] % m`, we know that `q2` has been increased by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The string `y` contains a space followed by the new value of `k` converted to a string.
