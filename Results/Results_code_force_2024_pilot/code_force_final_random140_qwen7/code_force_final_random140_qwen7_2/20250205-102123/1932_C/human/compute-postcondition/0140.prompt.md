Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; the array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all i; the string s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = str(k)
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y += ' ' + str(k)
    print(y[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is `-1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' in string `t`, `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations, which is determined by the last character of `t` and the values of `a` and `m` as per the operations inside the loop, `q1` and `q2` are defined based on the last character of `t` and adjusted during the loop, and `y` is a string containing the space-separated representations of all `k` values updated in each iteration.

This final state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations (from `i = n - 2` down to `-1`), and the variable `i` has reached its lower limit. The value of `k` reflects the cumulative product operation performed within the loop, adjusted by the characters 'L' and 'R' in the string `t`, modulo `m`. The string `y` contains all intermediate values of `k` concatenated with spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is -1, `k` is updated to the final value after all iterations, `q1` is either 0 or -1 (depending on the number of 'R' and 'L' in the string `t`), `q2` is either 1 or 0 (depending on the number of 'R' and 'L' in the string `t`), `y` is a string that includes spaces followed by the values of `k` converted to strings for each iteration, `n` is the original input integer, `m` is the original input integer, `a` is the original list of integers, `l` is the count of 'L' in the input string `t`, `t` is the original input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is -1, k is the final value of k after all iterations, q1 is l-1, q2 is l, y is a string containing spaces followed by the value of k converted to a string for each iteration, and ii is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
