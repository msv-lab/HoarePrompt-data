Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to process a series of test cases according to the problem description.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the necessary inputs: \(n\), \(m\), the array \(a\), and the string \(t\).
3. The logic for calculating the initial value \(k\) based on the last character of \(t\) and the elements of \(a\) is correct. This handles both 'L' and 'R' directions appropriately.
4. The loop iterates through the string \(t\) from the second last character to the first, updating \(k\) correctly based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
5. The final result is printed in reverse order, which matches the requirement of the problem statement.

Given the above points, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
