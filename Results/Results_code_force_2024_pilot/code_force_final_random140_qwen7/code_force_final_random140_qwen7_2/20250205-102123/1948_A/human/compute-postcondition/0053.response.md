Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`; `x` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding twice the value of `s[x]` to it. Additionally, `x` is increased by 1. The conditions and values of `n` (which must be at least 2) remain unchanged.
