Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in `range(n // 2)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `j < n // 2`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `x` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n // 2`.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `x` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, so for the next iteration, `x` should be increased by 1 again.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `ans` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `n` must still be at least 2.
- `x` is increased by 1 from the previous value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is increased by 1**.
