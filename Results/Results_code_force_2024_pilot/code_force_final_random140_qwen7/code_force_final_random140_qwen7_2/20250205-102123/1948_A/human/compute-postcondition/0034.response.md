Output State: **`ans` is 'ss', `x` is 2, `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, so `x` changes from 1 to 2. The other variables (`ans`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
