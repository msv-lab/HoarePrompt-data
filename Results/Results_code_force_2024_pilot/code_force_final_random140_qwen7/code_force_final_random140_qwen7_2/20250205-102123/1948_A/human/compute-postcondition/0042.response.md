Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, and `x` is `n // 2`. If `n` is odd, `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, and no changes are made to `ans`. If `n` is even, the final value of `ans` will be a string consisting of the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice, and `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, and `n` must be at least 2.
