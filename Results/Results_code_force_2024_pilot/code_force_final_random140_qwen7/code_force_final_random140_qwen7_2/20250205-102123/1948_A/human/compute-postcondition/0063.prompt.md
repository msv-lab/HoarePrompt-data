Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is a string containing the uppercase ASCII characters from 'A' to 'Z'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2 == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans, x = '', 0
        x = 0
        for j in range(n // 2):
            ans += s[x] * 2
            x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0. If the current value of `n` is an odd number, then `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]` for each iteration from 0 to `n`//2 - 1, and `x` is increased by 1 for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, and `x` is `n // 2`. If `n` is odd, `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, and no changes are made to `ans`. If `n` is even, the final value of `ans` will be a string consisting of the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice, and `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, and `n` must be at least 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `n // 2`, and `ans` will be a concatenated string where each character from `s` at index `x` is repeated twice. If `n % 2 == 1`, `x` remains as `n // 2`. Otherwise, after executing the loop `n // 2` times, `x` will be incremented by `n // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
