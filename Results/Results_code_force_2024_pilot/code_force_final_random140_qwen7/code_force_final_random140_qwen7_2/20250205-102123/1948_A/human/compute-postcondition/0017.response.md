Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]` plus its previous value, `j` is increased by 4, and `n` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` increments `ans` by twice the value of `s[x]`. Since `s[x]` was previously increased by 2 times its original value, `ans` now includes this updated value. `j` is increased by 4, and `n` remains unchanged.
