Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `n // 2`, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
