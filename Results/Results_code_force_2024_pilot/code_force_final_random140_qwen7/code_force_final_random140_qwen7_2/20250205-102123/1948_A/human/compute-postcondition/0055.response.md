Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`.
- `x` is increased by 1 and then increased by 1 again.

This means:
- `ans` has been updated based on the value of `s[x]`.
- `x` has been incremented twice.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for j in range(n // 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- The loop variable is `j`.
- The loop condition is `j < n // 2`.

### Adjusting States
- The only variable in the loop head is `j`.
- We need to determine the new value of `j` for the next iteration.

### Current State
- Since the loop has just completed an iteration, `j` must have been incremented from its previous value.
- If `j` was previously `k`, then after the current iteration, `j` is now `k + 1`.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n // 2`.
- Therefore, `j` should be set to `j + 1`.

### Updated State
- The state needs to reflect the new value of `j`.

Given that `j` was incremented from its previous value, let's assume `j` was `k` before the current iteration. After the current iteration, `j` is `k + 1`.

State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1 and then increased by 1 again, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` from the previous iteration.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we can represent it as:

State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1 and then increased by 1 again, `j` is `j + 1`**.

To provide a concrete example, if `j` was 2 before the current iteration, then after the current iteration, `j` would be 3.

State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1 and then increased by 1 again, `j` is 3**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1 and then increased by 1 again, `j` is 3**.
