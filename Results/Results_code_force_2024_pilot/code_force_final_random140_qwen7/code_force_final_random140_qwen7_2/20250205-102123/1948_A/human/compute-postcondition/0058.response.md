Output State: **The loop will execute `n // 2` times. After all iterations, `ans` will be a concatenated string where each character from `s` at index `x` is repeated twice, and `x` will be incremented by `n // 2`.**

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- `ans` will contain each character from `s` starting from index `x` (initially 2) repeated twice for each iteration of the loop.
- `x` will be equal to `2 + n // 2`, as it is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
- The loop will have executed `n // 2` times, as specified by the range in the loop header.
