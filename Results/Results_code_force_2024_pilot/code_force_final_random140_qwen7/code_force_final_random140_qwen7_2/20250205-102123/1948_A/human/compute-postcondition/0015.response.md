Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `j` is increased by 2, and `n` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Since the initial state mentions that `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]` and `j` is increased by 1, after the increment, `j` will be increased by 1 again, making it increased by 2 in total. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
