Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 3, `j` is 3**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding twice the value of `s[x]` to it. Additionally, the value of `x` is increased by 1 twice (so it is increased by 3 in total). The variable `j` remains unchanged and is still equal to 3.
