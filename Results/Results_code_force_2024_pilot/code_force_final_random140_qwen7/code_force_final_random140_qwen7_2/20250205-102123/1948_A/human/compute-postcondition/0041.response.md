Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an input integer, and `n` is converted to an integer. If `n` is an odd number, `t` remains unchanged, `i` remains 1, and no additional changes are made. If `n` is an even number, the final value of `ans` will be a string consisting of the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice. The value of `x` will be `n // 2`, and `t` remains at least 1 while `i` becomes 2.
