Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `t` must be at least 1, but no specific value is given for `t`, so we don't need to consider it for this particular print statement.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 2.
- `x` is defined as `n // 2`, where `n` is an input integer converted to an integer. However, the value of `n` is not specified, but it does not affect the print statement itself.
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without any variables or expressions being evaluated, the output remains `'NO'`.
