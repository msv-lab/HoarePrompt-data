Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is a string containing the uppercase ASCII characters from 'A' to 'Z'.**

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is an integer) to the variable `t`. The range constraints for `n` and the string `s` remain unchanged.
