Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly processes each test case by reading the value of `n` and determining whether a suitable string can be constructed.
- If `n` is odd, the program correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd (as explained in the problem statement).
- If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `ans` by repeating each character from the uppercase alphabet twice for `n // 2` times. This ensures that each character in the constructed string will have exactly one neighbor that is the same, making it a special character.
- The program ensures that the constructed string is of length `n` and has exactly `n` special characters, which satisfies the problem requirements.
- The program handles multiple test cases as specified, iterating `t` times and processing each `n` accordingly.
- The output format matches the problem requirements: "NO" if no suitable string exists, or "YES" followed by a suitable string if one exists.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
