Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is [0], `l2` is [0], `n` is 1, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. The length of `l2` is 1, which is equal to the length of `l1`, so the condition remains unchanged.
