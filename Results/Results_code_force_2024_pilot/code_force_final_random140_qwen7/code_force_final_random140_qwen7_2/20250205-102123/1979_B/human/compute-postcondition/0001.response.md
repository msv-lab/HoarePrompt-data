State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine the number of iterations.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition.
4. The initial state of `t` being an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive does not guarantee that the loop will execute if `t` is 0 or negative. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
