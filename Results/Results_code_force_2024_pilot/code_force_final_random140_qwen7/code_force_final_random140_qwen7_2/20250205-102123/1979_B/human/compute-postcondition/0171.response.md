Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - The loop body increments `cnt` by 1 if `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, and exits the most internal loop or if statement if they are not equal.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again if `i` is incremented to 2 (i.e., `i < n`).

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
