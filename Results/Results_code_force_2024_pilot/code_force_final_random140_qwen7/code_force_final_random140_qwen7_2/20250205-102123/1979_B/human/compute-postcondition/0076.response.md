Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `while y:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is non-zero.

2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `t` is 1
   - `x` is 0
   - `y` is an input integer
   - `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of `y` in reverse order
   - `l2` is an empty list

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: For the loop to execute at least once, `y` must be non-zero. Since `y` is an input integer, it can be any non-negative integer. However, the current state shows `y` as an input integer, which means it could be zero. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `y` must be non-zero.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `y` is non-zero so that the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `y` is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` must be non-zero, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of `y` in reverse order, `l2` is an empty list**
