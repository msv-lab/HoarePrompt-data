Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, and `l2` is a list whose length is at least 3, representing the binary digits of `y` after the loop has run three times. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, `l1` is updated to match the length of `l2`.**
