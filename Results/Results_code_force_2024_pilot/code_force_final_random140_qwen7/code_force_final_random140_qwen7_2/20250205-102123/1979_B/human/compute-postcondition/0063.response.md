Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial value of 1.
