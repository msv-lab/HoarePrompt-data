Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. Given that `n` is initially 1, the loop will only run once (when `i = 0`). According to the provided conditions, if `l1[0]` is equal to `l2[0]`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since the loop executes exactly once and the condition `l1[0] == l2[0]` must hold for the loop to continue (which it does based on the given output states), `cnt` is incremented to 1. After the loop completes, `i` will be 1 (one iteration has been completed), and `n` remains unchanged at 1.
