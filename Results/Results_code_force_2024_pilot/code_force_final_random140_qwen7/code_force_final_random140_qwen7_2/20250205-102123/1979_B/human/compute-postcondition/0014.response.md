Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will eventually become 0 because the loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero, and in each iteration, `x` is halved using integer division (`x //= 2`). The loop appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 (`x % 2`) to the list `l1`. Since `x % 2` gives the least significant bit of `x` in each step, `l1` will contain the binary representation of the original value of `x` in reverse order. The variable `y` remains unchanged, and `l2` remains an empty list as it is not affected by the loop.
