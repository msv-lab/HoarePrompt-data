Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of `y` in reverse order, `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is non-zero. Since `x` is being halved each iteration (`x //= 2`), it will eventually become zero when all its bits have been processed. After the loop completes, `x` will be 0, and `l1` will contain the binary representation of the original value of `x` (which was derived from `y`), but in reverse order.
Code of the loop:
while y:
    l2.append(y % 2)
    y //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is halved (non-zero), `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the new `y` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value of the new `y % 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is halved, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the new `y` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value of the new `y % 2`, and the value of `y` is halved.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is halved, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the new `y` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value of `y % 2`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
