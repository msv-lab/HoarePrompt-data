Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, and the length of `l2` is not less than the length of `l1`. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, the length of `l1` is updated to match the length of `l2`.
