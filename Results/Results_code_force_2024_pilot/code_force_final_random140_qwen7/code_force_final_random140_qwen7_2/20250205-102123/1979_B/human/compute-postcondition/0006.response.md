Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is now `x // 2`, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and assigns the quotient back to `x`. Since `x` was a non-zero integer from input, after executing this line, `x` is now `x // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
