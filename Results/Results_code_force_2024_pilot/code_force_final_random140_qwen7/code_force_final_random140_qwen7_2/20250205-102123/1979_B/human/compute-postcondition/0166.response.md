Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is 1, and the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` is not mentioned, so it is assumed to be 0. After executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
