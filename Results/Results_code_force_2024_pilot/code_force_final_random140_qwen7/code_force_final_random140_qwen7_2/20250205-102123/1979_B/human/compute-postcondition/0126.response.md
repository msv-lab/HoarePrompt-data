Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` must be a non-zero integer, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x` is a non-zero integer, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1. However, the exact value of `x % 2` is not specified, so we represent it as `[x % 2]` in the list `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
