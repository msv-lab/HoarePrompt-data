Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` must be non-zero, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the new `y` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value of `y % 2`, and `y` is halved.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Since `y` must be non-zero and is halved after this operation, the value of `y` is updated to its half. All other variables remain unchanged.
