Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is either [0] or remains unchanged, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` (in reverse order). If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, then `l1` becomes [0]; otherwise, `l1` remains unchanged.**
