Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list containing `[1, 1]`**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` performs an integer division of `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Given that `y` is initially an odd number (from the initial state), the only odd number that, when divided by 2, results in an integer is 1. So, `y` becomes 0 after the operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
