The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `y` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `y` must be non-zero.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` must be non-zero, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is an empty list**
