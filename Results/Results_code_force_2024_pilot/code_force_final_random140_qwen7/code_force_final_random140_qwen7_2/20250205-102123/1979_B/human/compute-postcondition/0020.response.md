Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is halved, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is a list containing the value of (`y` // 2) % 2, and `l2` has appended the value of `y % 2`.**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the quotient back to `y`. Since `y` was originally greater than 0, after this operation, `y` is now half of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
