Output State: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is non-zero. After the loop has executed three times, `x` becomes 0.25, which is effectively zero for integer division purposes in this context. Therefore, the loop will stop executing. Since the loop has now completed its iterations, `x` will be 0 (after the last decrement to 0.125, which is considered zero in integer division), and `l1` will contain the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in this case, assuming `x` was initially 4, so the binary representation is 100).
