Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` (in reverse order).

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will become 0 because the loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero, and in each iteration, `x` is halved using integer division (`x //= 2`). Since `x` starts as 0, it remains 0 throughout the loop. Similarly, `y` will eventually become 0 because the loop continues as long as `y` is non-zero, and in each iteration, `y` is halved using integer division (`y //= 2`). The loop appends the remainder of `y` divided by 2 (`y % 2`) to the list `l2`. Since `y % 2` gives the least significant bit of `y` in each step, `l2` will contain the binary representation of the original value of `y` in reverse order. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `l1` remains a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (which is 0, so `l1` is an empty list).
