Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l1` and `l2` are lists of integers with the same length, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables `n`, `l1`, `l2`, or `i`. It only indicates that the loop or if statement has been exited. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
