Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is now `x // 2` and `x` must be greater than 0, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2`, `l1` is updated with the new value of `x % 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x` is updated to `x // 2`, the value of `x % 2` is calculated and added to `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
