Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `y` becomes 0 because the loop condition `y` is no longer satisfied. During each iteration, the loop appends the current value of `y % 2` to both `l1` and `l2`. Since `l1` is initialized with the reversed binary digits of `y` and `l2` is built up during the loop, both lists end up containing the same information: the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order.
