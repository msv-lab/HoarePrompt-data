Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` must be non-zero, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of `y` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value of `y % 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `y % 2` to `l2`. Since `y` must be non-zero, `y % 2` will be either 0 or 1. However, without the exact value of `y`, we know that `l2` now contains one element, which is the result of `y % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
