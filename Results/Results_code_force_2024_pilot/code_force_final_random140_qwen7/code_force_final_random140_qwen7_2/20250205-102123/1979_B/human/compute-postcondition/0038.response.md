Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is either [0] or remains unchanged, `n` is the length of `l2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = len(l2)` calculates the length of the list `l2` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact length of `l2`, the only information we can extract is that `n` now holds the length of `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
