Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n):`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by default when using `range(n)`, so we don't need to change its value.
   - The variable `n` is the length of `l2`, and the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `l1` is either [0] or remains unchanged.
   - `n` is the length of `l2`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0 by default, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` (which is the length of `l2`) must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
