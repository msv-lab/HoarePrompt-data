Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is an odd number, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list containing `[1]`**

Explanation: The code appends `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Since `y` is an odd number, `y % 2` will be 1. Therefore, `l2` becomes `[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
