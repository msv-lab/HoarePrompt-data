Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l1` and `l2` are lists of integers with the same length.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
   - Either `cnt` is increased by 1 for each index `i` where `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, or there exists at least one index `i` where `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body, but based on the information provided, it should still be greater than 0.
   - The lists `l1` and `l2` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `l1` and `l2` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l1` and `l2` are lists of integers with the same length, `i` is `i + 1`**.
