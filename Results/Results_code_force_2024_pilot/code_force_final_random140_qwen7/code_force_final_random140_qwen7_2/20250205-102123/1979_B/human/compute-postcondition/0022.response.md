Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` must be non-zero, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is a list containing the value of (`y` // 2) % 2, and `l2` has appended the value of `y % 2`**

Explanation: The code `l2.append(y % 2)` appends the remainder of `y` divided by 2 to the list `l2`. Since `y` is non-zero, `y % 2` will be either 0 or 1. The lists `l1` and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `x` remains 0.
