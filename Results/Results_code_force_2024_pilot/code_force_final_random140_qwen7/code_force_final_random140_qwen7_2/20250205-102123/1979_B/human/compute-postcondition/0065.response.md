Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `t` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is an empty list, and `l2` is an empty list.
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be non-zero (i.e., `x != 0`).

Given the current state:
- `t` is 1 (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `x` is an input integer (we need to ensure `x` is non-zero).
- `y` is an input integer (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `l1` and `l2` are both empty lists (these do not affect the loop condition).

Since the loop condition depends solely on `x`, and `x` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `x` is non-zero for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x` must be non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is 1, `x` must be non-zero, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is an empty list, `l2` is an empty list**
