Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Given that `cnt` was initially 0, after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The first elements of `l1` and `l2` being equal is a precondition that remains unaffected by the code execution.
