Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of `l2`, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list with length less than 3.**

The code `n = len(l2)` assigns the length of the list `l2` to the variable `n`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact length of `l2`, the only change is that `n` now holds the length of `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
