Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is halved, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is a list containing the value of (`y` // 2) % 2, and `l2` has appended the value of `y % 2`**.

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the quotient back to `y`. Since `y` was originally non-zero, it is now halved. All other variables remain unchanged, so `t` is still greater than 0, `x` is still 0, and `l1` and `l2` retain their previous structures and contents.
