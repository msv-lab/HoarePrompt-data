Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially greater than 0.
