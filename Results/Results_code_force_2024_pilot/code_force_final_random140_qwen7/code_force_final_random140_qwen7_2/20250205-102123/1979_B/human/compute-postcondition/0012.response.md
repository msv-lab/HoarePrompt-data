Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is now `x // 2`, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2` appended with the new value of `x % 2`, `x` is halved.**

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `x`. This means `x` is now half of its original value. The other variables (`t`, `y`, and `l1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
