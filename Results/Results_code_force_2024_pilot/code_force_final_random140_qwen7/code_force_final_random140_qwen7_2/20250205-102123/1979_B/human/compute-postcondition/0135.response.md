Output State: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero. After the loop executes three times, `x` becomes 0.25, which is then floored to 0 in integer division. Therefore, the loop terminates. The list `l1` contains the binary digits of the original value of `x` (when `x` was an integer), read from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. Since `x` was initially some integer value, after three iterations, `l1` will contain the last three bits of that integer. If `x` was an integer like 6 (binary 110), `l1` would be `[0, 1, 1]`. However, based on the given outputs, `l1` is `[1, 0, 0]`, indicating the last three bits of `x` were 001. Thus, the final value of `x` is 0, and `l1` is `[1, 0, 0]`.
