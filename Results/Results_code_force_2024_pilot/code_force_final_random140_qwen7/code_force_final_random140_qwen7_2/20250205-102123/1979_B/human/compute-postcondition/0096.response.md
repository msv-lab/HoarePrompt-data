Postcondition: `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and `l2` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order. The length of `l2` is either one more than or equal to the length of `l1`.
