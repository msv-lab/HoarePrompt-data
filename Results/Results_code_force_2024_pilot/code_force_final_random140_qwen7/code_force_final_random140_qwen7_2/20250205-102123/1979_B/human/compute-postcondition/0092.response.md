Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`, and the length of `l1` is one more than the length of `l2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list `l1`. Since `l1` originally contained all binary digits of `y` in reverse order, appending `0` increases its length by 1. The value of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The condition that the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1` and the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2` remains true because `l1` now has one more element than before, but `l2` still has the same number of elements as it did before.
