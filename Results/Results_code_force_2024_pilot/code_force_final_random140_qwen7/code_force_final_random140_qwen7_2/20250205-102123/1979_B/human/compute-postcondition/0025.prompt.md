Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will eventually become 0 because the loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero, and in each iteration, `x` is halved using integer division (`x //= 2`). The loop appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 (`x % 2`) to the list `l1`. Since `x % 2` gives the least significant bit of `x` in each step, `l1` will contain the binary representation of the original value of `x` in reverse order. The variable `y` remains unchanged, and `l2` remains an empty list as it is not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
while y:
    l2.append(y % 2)
    y //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is now half of its original value, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is a list containing the value of (`y` // 2) % 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is halved, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is a list containing the value of (`y` // 2) % 2, and `l2` has appended the value of `y % 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is halved, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is a list containing the value of (`y` // 2) % 2, and `l2` has appended the value of `y % 2`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
