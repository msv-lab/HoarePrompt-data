Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is either [0] or remains unchanged, `n` is the length of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(l1)` calculates the length of the list `l1` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `l1` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0, `x` is still 0, `y` is still 0, and `l1` is either [0] or remains unchanged. The new variable `n` is assigned the length of `l1`.
