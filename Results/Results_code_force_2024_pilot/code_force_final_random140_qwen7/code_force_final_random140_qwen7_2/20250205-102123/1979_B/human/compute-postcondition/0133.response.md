Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0.25, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[1]`, `l2` is an empty list**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `0.5 // 2` results in `0.25`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
