Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `cnt` is either 1 or 0.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `l1` is a list `[1, 0, 0]`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(2 ** cnt)
```

Given the precondition, `cnt` can only be either 1 or 0. We need to consider both possibilities:

1. If `cnt` is 0, then `2 ** cnt` would be `2 ** 0`, which equals 1.
2. If `cnt` is 1, then `2 ** cnt` would be `2 ** 1`, which equals 2.

Since the problem does not specify which value `cnt` takes, we need to consider both cases. However, the question asks for what will be printed, so we should provide the possible outputs based on the given conditions.

Output: **1 or 2 (depending on the value of cnt, which is either 1 or 0)**
