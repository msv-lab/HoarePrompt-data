Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is a non-zero integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list.**

The code appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x` is a non-zero integer, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
