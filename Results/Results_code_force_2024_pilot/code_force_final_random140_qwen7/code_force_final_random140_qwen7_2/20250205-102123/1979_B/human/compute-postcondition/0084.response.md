Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is halved, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the new `y` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value of `y % 2`**.

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `y`. This means `y` is now half of its original value. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `l1`, and `l2`) remain unchanged from their initial states. `l1` still contains the binary digits of the new `y` in reverse order, and `l2` still contains the value of `y % 2`.
