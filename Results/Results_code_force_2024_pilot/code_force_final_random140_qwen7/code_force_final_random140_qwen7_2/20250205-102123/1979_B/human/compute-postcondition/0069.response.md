Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is `x // 2`, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[x % 2, 0]`, `l2` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code appends `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Initially, `l1` contains `[x % 2]`. After appending `x % 2`, `l1` now contains `[x % 2, 0]` since `x % 2` was already the first element. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
