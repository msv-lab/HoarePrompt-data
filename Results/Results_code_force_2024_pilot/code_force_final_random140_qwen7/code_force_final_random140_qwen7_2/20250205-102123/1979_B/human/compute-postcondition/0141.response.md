Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is an odd number, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list containing `[1]`, `y` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated by performing integer division by 2 (`y //= 2`). Since `y` is an odd number initially, let's denote it as `y = 2k + 1` for some integer `k`. After performing `y //= 2`, `y` becomes `k`, which is no longer odd. The smallest odd number is 1, so the smallest possible value for `y` after this operation is 0 (if `y` was 1 initially). Given that `y` is an odd number before the operation, the only odd number that can result from integer division by 2 is 0, implying `y` was 2 initially. Therefore, `y` becomes 0 after the operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
