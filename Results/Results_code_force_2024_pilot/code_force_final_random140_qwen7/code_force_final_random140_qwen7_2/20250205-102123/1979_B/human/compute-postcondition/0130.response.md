Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0.5, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[0]`, `l2` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and then floors the result. Given that `x` must be non-zero initially, let's assume the smallest non-zero value for `x` which is 1 (since `x` must be non-zero and typically in such scenarios, the smallest non-zero integer is considered). After executing `x //= 2`, `x` becomes `0.5`. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
