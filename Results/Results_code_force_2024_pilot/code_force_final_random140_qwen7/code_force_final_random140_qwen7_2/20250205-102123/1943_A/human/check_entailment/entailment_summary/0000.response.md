Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to simulate the game between Alice and Bob and determine the game's final score based on the optimal strategy.
2. The program correctly handles multiple test cases, as indicated by the outer loop iterating over the number of test cases.
3. For each test case, the program constructs a frequency count (`cntl`) of each element in the array \(a\).
4. The logic for determining the game's final score is as follows:
   - If the count of 0 is zero, the MEX must be 0, so it prints 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the initial value of `c` as the minimum of 2 and the count of 0.
   - It then iterates through the counts of other elements to find the smallest integer \(j\) (other than 0) whose count is less than 2. If such an element is found, it updates `c` and prints the result accordingly.
5. This approach aligns with the problem statement and examples provided. Specifically:
   - In the first test case, the program correctly identifies that the MEX is 2.
   - In the second test case, the program correctly identifies that the MEX is 1.
   - In the third test case, the program correctly identifies that the MEX is 0.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic for determining the MEX under the optimal strategy for both players, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
