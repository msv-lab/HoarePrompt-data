You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    if cntl[j] == 0:
                        print(j)
                        break
                    else:
                        c -= 1
                        if not c:
                            print(j)
                            break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the array \( a \) and stores these counts in the `cntl` array. If the count of the integer 0 in the array \( a \) is zero, it prints 0. Otherwise, it finds the smallest integer \( j \) (other than 0) whose count is less than 2 and prints \( j \). After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and calculates the MEX of the array `c` optimally.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It creates a count array `cntl` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - This is done using `cntl[i] += 1` for each element `i` in `a`.

3. **Determining the Initial MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, it prints `0` immediately, indicating that `0` is the MEX.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`, meaning Alice can place at most 2 zeros in `c`.

4. **Calculating the MEX:**
   - It iterates through the elements from `1` to `n` and checks the count of each element.
   - If any element `j` appears less than 2 times, it updates `c` accordingly.
   - If `c` becomes `0`, it means the MEX is `j` and it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

### Correctness Check

#### Test Case 1: `0 0 1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[2, 2, 0]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `2`, `c` is set to `2`.
- The loop checks elements from `1` to `2` and finds no element with count less than `2`.
- Therefore, the output should be `2`.

#### Test Case 2: `0 1 2 3`
- `cntl` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `1`, `c` is set to `1`.
- The loop checks elements from `1` to `3` and finds no element with count less than `2`.
- Therefore, the output should be `1`.

#### Test Case 3: `1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[0, 2]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `0`, it directly prints `0`.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the MEX is calculated accurately.
