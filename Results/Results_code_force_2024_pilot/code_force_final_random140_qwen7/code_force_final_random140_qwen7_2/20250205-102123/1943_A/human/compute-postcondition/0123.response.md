Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in a:`, where `a` is a list of integers.
   - The loop variable is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `cntl` is a list where all elements are 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on the list `a` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty.
   - The initial value of `j` (which is 1) and `n` (an input integer) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.
   - The state of `cntl` (all elements equal to 0) is irrelevant to the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
