Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is equal to `n`, `c` is 2, and no break statements were executed during the loop's iterations.**

Explanation: Given the conditions and the behavior of the loop, if the loop completes all its iterations without breaking early, it means that for each `j` from 1 to `n`, neither `cntl[j]` is 0 nor `cntl[j]` is less than 2. Therefore, the value of `j` will reach `n`, and since there are no conditions that reduce `c` to 0 and trigger a break, `c` remains 2.
