Output State: All elements in `cntl` are equal to `k`, and `j` is 0.

Explanation: The loop runs `k` times, incrementing `cntl[i]` for each iteration where `i` takes on values from the sequence defined by `a`. Since the loop runs `k` times, each element in `cntl` will be incremented `k` times, resulting in all elements being equal to `k`. Additionally, as the loop progresses, the value of `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. Therefore, after all iterations, `j` will be 0, and every element in `cntl` will be `k`.
