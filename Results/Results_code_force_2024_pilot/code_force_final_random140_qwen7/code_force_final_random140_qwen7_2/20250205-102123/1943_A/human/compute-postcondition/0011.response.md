Output State: The list `a` is a non-empty list of integers, and `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1 for each integer `i` present in `a`. After all iterations of the loop, `cntl[i]` will contain the total count of occurrences of each integer `i` in the list `a`.

This means that for every integer `i` in the list `a`, `cntl[i]` will reflect how many times `i` appears in `a`.
