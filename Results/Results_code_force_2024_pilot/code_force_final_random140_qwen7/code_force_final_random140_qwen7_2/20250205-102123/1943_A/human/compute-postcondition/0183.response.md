Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t, n, and array a.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with specific constraints on the values of t, n, and the array a. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case without accepting any parameters directly within its definition.
