Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, and either `cntl[2]` is less than 2 with `c` being 0, or `cntl[2]` is less than 2 with `c` being -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is within. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, the values of `j`, `n`, `cntl[2]`, and `c` remain unchanged. The conditions specified in the initial state still hold true after the `break` statement is executed.
