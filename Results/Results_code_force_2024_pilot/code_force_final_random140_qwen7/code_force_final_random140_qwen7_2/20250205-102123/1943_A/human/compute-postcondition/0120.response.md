Output State: **All elements in `cntl` are equal to `k`, and `j` is 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial values of `cntl` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, all elements in `cntl` are still equal to `k`, and `j` is still 1.
