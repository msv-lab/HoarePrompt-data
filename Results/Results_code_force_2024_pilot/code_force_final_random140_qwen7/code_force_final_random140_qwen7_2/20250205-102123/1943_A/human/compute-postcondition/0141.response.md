Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, and the value of `cntl[j]` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since `cntl[j]` was less than 2 (specifically, it was 0), the `break` statement is executed, but it does not change the values of `j`, `n`, or `cntl[j]`. It only indicates that we exit the loop or conditional block we are currently inside.
