Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the `print(j)` statement.
- `cntl[2]` is less than 2, and depending on this, `c` is either 0 or -1. However, the value of `c` itself is not relevant for determining what `print(j)` will output.

The `print(j)` statement will simply print the value of `j`.

Output: **3**
