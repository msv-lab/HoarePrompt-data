Postcondition: **The list `a` is a non-empty list of integers, and `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1 for each integer `i` present in `a`. After all iterations of the loop, `cntl[i]` will contain the total count of occurrences of each integer `i` in the list `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.**
