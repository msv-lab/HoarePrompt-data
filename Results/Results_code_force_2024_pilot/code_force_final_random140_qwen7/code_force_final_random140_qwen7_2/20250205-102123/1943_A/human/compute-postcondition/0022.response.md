Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `cntl[j]` is 0 is also still valid, but since `cntl` is not mentioned in the initial state or affected by the code, it is not included in the output state.
