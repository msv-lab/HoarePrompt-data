Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `cntl` is an array (or list) where the value at index `i` is increased by 1.**

The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the `cntl` array by 1. The initial state of `a` being a list of integers with at least one element remains unchanged. The `cntl` array's state changes by increasing the value at index `i` by 1.
