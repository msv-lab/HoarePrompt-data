Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, `c` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `j`, `n`, `cntl[2]`, and `c` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variable values.
