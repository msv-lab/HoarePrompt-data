Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `num_tests` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t` and `num_tests` remain unchanged.
