Output State: **`j` is either 1 or 2; `n` is greater than 0; `cntl[2]` is not 0; `c` is false and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `cntl[2]`, and `c`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
