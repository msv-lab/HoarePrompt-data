Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is either 1 or 2.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - If `cntl[2]` equals 0, we break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, `j` is set to 1 and if the condition `not c` is true, we also break out of the loop.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be within the range `[1, n]`.
   - Additionally, if `cntl[2]` is 0, the loop breaks, so `cntl[2]` cannot be 0.
   - If `cntl[2]` is not 0, then `j` must be set to 1 and `not c` must be false (since setting `j` to 1 would only happen if `not c` is false).

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `j` is either 1 or 2, and it needs to be within the range `[1, n]`, and `n` is greater than 0, `j` can still be 1 or 2 as long as `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `cntl[2]` must not be 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `c` must be true for `j` to remain 1 (since if `not c` is true, the loop breaks).

Given these conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` is either 1 or 2.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `cntl[2]` is not 0.
- `c` is true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is either 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `cntl[2]` is not 0, `c` is true**
