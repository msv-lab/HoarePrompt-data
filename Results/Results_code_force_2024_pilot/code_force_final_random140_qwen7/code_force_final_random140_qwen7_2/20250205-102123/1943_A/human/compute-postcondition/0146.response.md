Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and not equal to 0, `c` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block that `j` and `cntl[j]` are part of. The values of the other variables (`j`, `n`, `cntl[j]`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
