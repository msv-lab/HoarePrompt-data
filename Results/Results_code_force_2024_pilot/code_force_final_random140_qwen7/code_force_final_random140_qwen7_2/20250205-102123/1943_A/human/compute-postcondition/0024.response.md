Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is at least 1, and the value of `cntl[j]` is less than 1, but `cntl[j]` is not equal to 0, `c` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1. Since `c` was not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it exists and is updated. The conditions for `j`, `n`, and `cntl[j]` remain unchanged except that `cntl[j]` is now less than 1 (previously it was less than 2 but not equal to 0).
