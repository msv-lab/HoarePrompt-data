Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be either 1 or 2, `n` will be greater than 0, and `c` will be 0 if `cntl[2]` is not 0. If `cntl[2]` is 0, `c` will be 0 regardless of the value of `j`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will have been set to either 1 or 2 (depending on the conditions within the loop), `n` will still be greater than 0 (as it was not modified in the loop), and `c` will be 0 if `cntl[2]` was not 0 during any iteration where `j` was set to 2. If `cntl[2]` was 0, `c` will be 0 because the loop would have broken when `cntl[2]` was checked.
