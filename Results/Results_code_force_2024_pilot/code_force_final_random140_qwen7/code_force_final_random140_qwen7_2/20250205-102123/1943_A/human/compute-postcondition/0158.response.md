Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[2]` is less than 2, or it is not 0, but this information is not necessary to determine the value of `j`.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `j`, which is explicitly stated to be 2.

Output: **2**
