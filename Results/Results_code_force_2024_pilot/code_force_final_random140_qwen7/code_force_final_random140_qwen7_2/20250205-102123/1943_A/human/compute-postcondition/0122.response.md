Output State: **All elements in `cntl` are now equal to 0, `j` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cntl` as a list of length `n + 1` where each element is set to 0. The values of `j`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
