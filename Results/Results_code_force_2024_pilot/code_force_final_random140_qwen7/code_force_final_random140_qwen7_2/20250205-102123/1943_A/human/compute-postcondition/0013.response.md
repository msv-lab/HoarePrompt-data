Based on the initial state provided:

- The list `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1 for each integer `i` present in `a`.
- After processing all integers in `a`, `cntl[i]` will contain the count of occurrences of each integer `i` in the list `a`.
- The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0.

The print statement simply outputs the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
