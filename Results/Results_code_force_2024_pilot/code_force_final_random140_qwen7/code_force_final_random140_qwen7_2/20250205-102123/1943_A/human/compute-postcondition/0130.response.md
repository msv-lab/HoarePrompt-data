Output State: `cntl` is an array where the value at each index `i` from the list `a` is increased by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`, and `a` is an empty list since it has been fully processed.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `cntl` will contain the count of how many times each integer from the original list `a` appeared. The list `a` will be empty as all its elements have been processed.
