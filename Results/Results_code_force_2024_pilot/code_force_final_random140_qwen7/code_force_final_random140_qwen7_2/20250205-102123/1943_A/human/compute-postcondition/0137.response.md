Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j` and `n`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j` in the range `1` to `n+1`, the initial value of `j` should be `1`.
   - The value of `n` can be derived from the context, but it is not explicitly given. We need to infer it based on the information provided.

3. **Analyze the Given Information**:
   - `cntl` is an array where the value at each index `i` from the list `a` is increased by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`.
   - `a` is an empty list, meaning no elements have been added to `a` yet.
   - `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
   - `c` is 2 if `cntl[0]` is less than or equal to 2, otherwise `c` is 2.

4. **Determine the Value of `n`**:
   - Since `a` is an empty list, there are no elements to increment in `cntl`. Therefore, `cntl[0]` remains as its initial value (which is not zero).
   - Given that `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and considering the condition for `c`, `c` will be 2 regardless of the value of `cntl[0]`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The loop will start with `j` set to `1`.
   - The value of `n` can be inferred from the structure of the loop, but since it is not specified, we assume `n` is a positive integer that allows the loop to run at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once**
