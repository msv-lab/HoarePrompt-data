Postcondition: `cntl` is an array where the value at each index `i` from the list `a` is increased by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`, and `a` is an empty list since it has been fully processed. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then `cntl` reflects the counts of all elements in `a`. After the loop has executed all its iterations, regardless of the initial value of `cntl[0]`, `cntl` will correctly represent the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, and `a` will be an empty list.
