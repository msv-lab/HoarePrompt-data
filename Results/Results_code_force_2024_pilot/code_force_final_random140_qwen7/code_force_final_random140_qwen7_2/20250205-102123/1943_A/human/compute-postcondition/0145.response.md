Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified, so we only know it allows the loop to run at least once.
- `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and not equal to 0. Since `j` is 1, `cntl[1]` must be either 1 or a value less than 2 but not 0.
- `c` is explicitly set to 0.

The `print(j)` statement simply prints the value of `j`.

Output: **1**
