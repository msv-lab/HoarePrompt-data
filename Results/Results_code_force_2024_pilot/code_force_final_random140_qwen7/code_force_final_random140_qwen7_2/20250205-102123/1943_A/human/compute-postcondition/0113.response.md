Postcondition: `j` is either 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `cntl[2]` is not 0, and `c` remains true if the condition `cntl[j] == 0` is met, resulting in breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `cntl[j] == 0` is not met, `c` remains false, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
