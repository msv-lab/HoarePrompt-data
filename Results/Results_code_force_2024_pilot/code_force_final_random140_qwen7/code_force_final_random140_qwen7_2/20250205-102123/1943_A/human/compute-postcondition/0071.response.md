Output State: All elements in `cntl` are equal to `k`. The variable `j` remains equal to `n`, `c` remains 2, and `n` remains the input integer. After the loop executes all its iterations, each index `i` in the list `cntl` has been incremented exactly `k` times, where `k` is the total number of iterations the loop ran.

This means that if the loop runs `k` times, every element in the `cntl` list, which initially was set to 0 for all indices, will now be incremented `k` times, resulting in each element being `k`. The variables `j`, `c`, and `n` do not change during the loop's execution.
