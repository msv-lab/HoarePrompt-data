Output State: **All elements in `cntl` are equal to `k`, `j` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The initial state of `cntl`, `j`, and `n` remains unchanged.
