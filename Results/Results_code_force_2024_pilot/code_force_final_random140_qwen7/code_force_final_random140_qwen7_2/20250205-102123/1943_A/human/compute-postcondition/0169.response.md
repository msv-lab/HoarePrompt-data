Output State: **`j` is 3, `c` is -1**

Explanation: The value of `j` remains unchanged at 3. The variable `c` is decremented by 1. Given that `cntl[2]` is less than 2 with `c` being initially 0 or -1, after decrementing `c` by 1, `c` becomes -1. The conditions regarding `cntl[2]` and the loop remain unchanged.
