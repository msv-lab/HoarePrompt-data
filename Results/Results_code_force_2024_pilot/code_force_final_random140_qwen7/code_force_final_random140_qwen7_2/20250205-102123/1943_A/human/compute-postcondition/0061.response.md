Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The list `a` is a non-empty list of integers, and `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1 for each integer `i` present in `a`. After all iterations of the loop, `cntl[i]` will contain the total count of occurrences of each integer `i` in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then `cntl[0]` remains 0. Otherwise, `j` is equal to `n`, `c` is 2, and no break statements were executed during the loop's iterations.

2. **Loop Statement**: 
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`.
   - Each iteration processes an element from the list `a` and increments the corresponding `cntl[i]` value.
   - The loop head does not involve `a` or `cntl` directly; it only specifies the number of iterations based on user input.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop head does not directly involve `a` or `cntl`, there are no changes to these lists or counters within the loop head itself.
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of iterations left, which is determined by the input.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - Let's assume the input to `int(input())` is `k`. This means the loop will run `k` times.
   - After the first iteration, `k` will be reduced by 1, so the loop will run `k-1` times in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the remaining number of iterations.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1 for each integer `i` present in `a`, `j` is equal to `n`, `c` is 2, and no break statements were executed during the loop's iterations, and the number of iterations left is `k-1`**.
