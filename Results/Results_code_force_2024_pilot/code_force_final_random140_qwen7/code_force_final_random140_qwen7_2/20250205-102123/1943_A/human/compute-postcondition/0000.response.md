Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the constraints**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - This means the input value (which we will call `num_tests`) should be within this range.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: 
   - Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range. 

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the input value is valid. 

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, num_tests (the input value) must be within the range 1 ≤ num_tests ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4**
