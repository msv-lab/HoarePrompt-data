Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is at least 1, and the value of `cntl[j]` is less than 1 but not equal to 0, `c` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered by the `break` statement, the values of `j`, `n`, `cntl[j]`, and `c` remain unchanged.
