Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `cntl` is an array (or list) where the value at index `i` is increased by 1.

4. **Analyze what happens in each iteration**:
   - In each iteration, the loop takes an element from the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `i`.
   - The value at index `i` in the `cntl` array is increased by 1.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `a` is a list, after taking an element `i` from `a`, the list `a` will have one less element.
   - The `cntl` array remains unchanged until the next iteration when the value at index `i` is incremented.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `a` will have one less element than it did at the end of the previous iteration.
- `cntl` remains unchanged until the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `a` has one less element and `cntl` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `cntl` is an array (or list) where the value at index `i` is increased by 1**.
