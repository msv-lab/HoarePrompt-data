Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once.
   - Either `cntl[2]` is less than 2 with `c` being 0, or `cntl[2]` is less than 2 with `c` being -1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `j` will become 3 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays as it was.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still allows the loop to run at least once.
   - The condition involving `cntl[2]` and `c` remains the same unless modified within the loop body, so we keep these conditions as they are.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, and either `cntl[2]` is less than 2 with `c` being 0, or `cntl[2]` is less than 2 with `c` being -1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
