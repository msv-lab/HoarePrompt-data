Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is at least 1, but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement.
- `cntl[j]` is less than 1 but not equal to 0. Since `j` is 1, `cntl[1]` fits this description.
- `c` is explicitly given as 0, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is simply `print(j)`, which will output the value of `j`.

Output: **1**
