Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once
- Either `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and `c` is 0, or `cntl[j]` is not 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop starts with `j = 1`.
   - After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is a positive integer and allows the loop to run at least once.
   - Since the loop condition is `range(1, n + 1)`, the loop will continue as long as `j < n + 1`.
   - There is no change to `n` within the loop, so `n` remains the same.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < n + 1`.
   - Given that `j` is currently 1 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- `j` will be incremented to 2.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- The condition `j < n + 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### New State:
- `j` is 2
- `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once
- Either `cntl[2]` is less than 2 and `c` is 0, or `cntl[2]` is not 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, and either `cntl[2]` is less than 2 and `c` is 0, or `cntl[2]` is not 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
