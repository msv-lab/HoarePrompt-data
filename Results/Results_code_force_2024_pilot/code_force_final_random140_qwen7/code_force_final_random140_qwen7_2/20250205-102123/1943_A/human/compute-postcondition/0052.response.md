Output State: **`j` is 3, `c` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j` and `c`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Since there is no loop or if statement provided in the code snippet, the values of `j` and `c` remain unchanged.
