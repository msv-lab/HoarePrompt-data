Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 1 (as per the `range(1, n + 1)`).
   - `n` is an unknown variable that determines the number of iterations.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is initialized to 1, we don't need to change its value.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.

Given the initial state where all elements in `cntl` are equal to `k` and `c` is 2, these variables are not directly involved in the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only variables that need adjustment are `j` and `n`.

State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
