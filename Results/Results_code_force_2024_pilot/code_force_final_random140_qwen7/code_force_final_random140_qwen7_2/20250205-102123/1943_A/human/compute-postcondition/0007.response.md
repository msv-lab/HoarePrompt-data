Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1, where `i` is the second element of the list `a`. The initial state of `a` being a non-empty list of integers and `i` being the second element of the list `a` remains unchanged. The only change is that `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.
