Based on the initial state described:

- `cntl` is an array where the value at each index `i` from the list `a` is increased by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`.
- `a` is an empty list since it has been fully processed.
- The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0.

The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer 0, as there is no other information to be derived from the `cntl` array or any other variables.

Output: **0**
