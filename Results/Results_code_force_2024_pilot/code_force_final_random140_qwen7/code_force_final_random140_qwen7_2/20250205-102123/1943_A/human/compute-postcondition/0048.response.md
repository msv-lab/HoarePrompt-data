Output: **3**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `j` is explicitly given as 3. The code snippet only prints the value of `j`, and there are no operations that change the value of `j` between the initial state and the print statement. Therefore, when the `print(j)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `j`, which is 3.
