Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. The program uses a fixed loop that iterates over the range `13`, which means it only processes the numbers from 1 to 12. This is insufficient because the input `n` can be up to `2 * 10^5`.

2. The program calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 12 and prints the result, which is irrelevant to the actual problem where multiple test cases are expected.

3. The program does not read input or handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

Given these points, the program is not correct for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
