### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and the problem statement to understand why:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   - The task is to replace each integer from 1 to \( n \) with the sum of its digits and then find the sum of these new numbers.
   - For example, for \( n = 12 \), the numbers on the board would be replaced as follows:
     - 1 → 1
     - 2 → 2
     - 3 → 3
     - 4 → 4
     - 5 → 5
     - 6 → 6
     - 7 → 7
     - 8 → 8
     - 9 → 9
     - 10 → 1 + 0 = 1
     - 11 → 1 + 1 = 2
     - 12 → 1 + 2 = 3
   - The sum of these numbers is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 51 \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of the digits of a number.
   - The main part of the program iterates over the numbers 1 to 12 and sums the results of `func_1(i)` for these numbers.
   - This means the program is only testing the `func_1` function with numbers from 1 to 12 and printing the sum of these tests.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a number.
   - The loop in the main part of the program runs from 1 to 12 and sums the results of `func_1(i)` for these numbers.
   - This is irrelevant to the problem since the program is not iterating over all numbers from 1 to \( n \) as required by the problem statement.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not perform the necessary steps to solve the problem. It only tests the `func_1` function with a fixed set of numbers (1 to 12) and does not handle the general case where \( n \) can be any value up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
