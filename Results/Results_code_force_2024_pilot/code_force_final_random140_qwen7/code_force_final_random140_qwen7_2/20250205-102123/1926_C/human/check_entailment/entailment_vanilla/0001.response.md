Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Program Structure**:
   - The program initializes `soma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (inclusive).
   - For each number in this range, it calls the function `func_1` and adds the result to `soma`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `soma`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer `n` as input.
   - It converts the integer `n` to a string.
   - It then iterates over each character in the string representation of `n`, converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up.
   - For example, `func_1(12)` will convert `12` to `"12"`, then sum `1 + 2` to get `3`.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to `n` and then summing these results.
   - The program, however, only calculates the sum of the digits for numbers from 0 to 12 and does not handle any larger values of `n`.

### Conclusion

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the program does not meet the requirements. The program only processes numbers from 0 to 12, whereas the problem specifies that the input `n` can be up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
