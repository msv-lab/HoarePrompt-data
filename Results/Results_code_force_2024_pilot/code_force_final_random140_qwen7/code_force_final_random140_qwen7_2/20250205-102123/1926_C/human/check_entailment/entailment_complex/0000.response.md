Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program initializes `soma` to 0 and then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (13 times), calling `func_1(i)` for each `i` in this range. However, the problem requires processing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where `n` is provided as input. Additionally, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number, but it is being called with values from 0 to 12 instead of the required range from 1 to `n`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the program should be modified to read input values for `t` and `n`, and then iterate over the range from 1 to `n` to calculate the sum of the digits for each number. The current implementation does not match this requirement.

Correctness: **False**
