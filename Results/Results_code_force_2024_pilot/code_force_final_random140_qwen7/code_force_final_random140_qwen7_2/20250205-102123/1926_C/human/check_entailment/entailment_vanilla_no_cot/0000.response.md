Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of the digits of a number, but it only processes numbers from 0 to 12 (inclusive) and does not handle the input `t` test cases or any number `n` greater than 12. The main loop sums the results of `func_1` for numbers 0 to 12 and prints the result, which is clearly not what the problem requires.
