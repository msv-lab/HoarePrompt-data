Output State: **The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer n.**

Given that `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\), the code converts `n` into a string and then iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`. Each digit is converted back to an integer using `int(d)` and then summed up. The final result of this summation is returned.
