Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `x` and `n` as specified.
3. It calculates `k` as `x // n`, which is used as a reference value.
4. The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
5. A loop iterates over potential divisors of `x` up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. This is an optimization because any factor larger than the square root of `x` would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.
6. Inside the loop, it checks if `i` or `x // i` (the other factor) is less than or equal to `k`. If so, it considers these values as potential candidates for the GCD.
7. The maximum of these candidates is taken as the new value of `ans`.
8. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

Given the logic, the program aims to find the maximum GCD of `n` numbers whose sum is `x`. The approach is sound, and the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
