Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Calculating the Base Difficulty:**
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which represents the base difficulty if the problems were evenly distributed.

3. **Finding Possible Balances:**
   - The program then iterates through numbers from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` to find divisors of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum balance (`ans`) found among these possibilities.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the maximum balance found for each test case.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Divisors and Balance Calculation:**
  - The key idea is to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that both `d` and `x // d` are less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the problems can be divided into `n` parts with the highest possible balance.
  - The loop `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2)` is used to check all potential divisors efficiently.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `x` is a prime number, the only divisors are `1` and `x` itself. In such cases, the balance would be `1` because no smaller divisor exists.
  - If `x` is a perfect square, the loop will correctly handle it by checking both `i` and `x // i`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program uses a reasonable approach to find the maximum balance. It leverages the fact that the GCD of the difficulties will be maximized when the difficulties are as close to each other as possible.

### Testing the Program:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10 3`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The optimal division is `4, 2, 4` with GCD `2`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `5 5`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: The only possible division is `1, 1, 1, 1, 1` with GCD `1`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `420 69`
  - Output: `6`
  - Explanation: The optimal division is `6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6,
