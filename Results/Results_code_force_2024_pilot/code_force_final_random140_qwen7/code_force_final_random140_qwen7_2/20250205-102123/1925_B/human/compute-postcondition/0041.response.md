Output State: **The final value of `ans` is determined as the maximum value among all possible values of `i` and `x // i` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` (inclusive), provided that both `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will hold the highest value found among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`. This includes both direct divisors `i` and their corresponding quotient `x // i` for each `i` within the specified range.
