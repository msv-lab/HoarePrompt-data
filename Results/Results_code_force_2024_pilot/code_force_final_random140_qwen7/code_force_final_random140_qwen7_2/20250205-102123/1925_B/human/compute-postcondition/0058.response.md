Postcondition: `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is 1, `x % i` equals 0, and `l` is `[1, i, x // i]`.

This postcondition states that after the execution of the if-else block, `i` remains less than or equal to `k`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` remains 1, `x % i` equals 0, and the list `l` is updated to include `x // i` in addition to the existing elements `[1, i]`.
