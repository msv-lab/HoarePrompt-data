Postcondition: `i` is 7, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, and `l` is a list. If `x % 7 == 0`, then `x` is divided by 7 and added to the list `l`, making the list contain the elements 7, `x // 7`, and `ans` (where `ans` is the maximum value among [6, 6, `x // 7`]). If `x % 7 != 0`, the list `l` remains unchanged, and `ans` is still the maximum value among [6, 6, `x // 7`].
