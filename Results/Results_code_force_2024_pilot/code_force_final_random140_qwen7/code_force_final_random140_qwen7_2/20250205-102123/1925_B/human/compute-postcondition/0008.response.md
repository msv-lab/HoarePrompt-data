Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is an integer and divisible by `i`, `l` is a list containing 'ans' and `i`, `n` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains one element 'ans'. After appending `i`, `l` now contains 'ans' and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
