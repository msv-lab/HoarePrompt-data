Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 2`, `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original value of `i` and the second element is `i`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains one element `ans`. After appending `i`, `l` now contains two elements: the original value of `i` (which is `i + 2`) and the new value of `i`. The conditions for `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
