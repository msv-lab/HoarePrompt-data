Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is greater than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `x` and `n` remain as their original input integers, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `l` contains all such divisors including `ans` if there are multiple.**

In simpler terms, after running through all iterations of the loop, `ans` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, where `k` is `x // n`. The variable `i` will be greater than the square root of `x` plus one. The original values of `x`, `n`, and `k` will remain unchanged, and `l` will contain all divisors of `x` that meet the criteria, with `ans` being the maximum value in this list.
