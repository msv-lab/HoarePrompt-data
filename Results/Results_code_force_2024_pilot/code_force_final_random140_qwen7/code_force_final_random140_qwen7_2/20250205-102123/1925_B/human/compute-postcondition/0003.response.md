Output State: **`ans` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer from the input, `n` is an integer from the input, and `k` is the integer result of `x // n`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. No other changes are made to the other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, and `k`). Therefore, the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain as they were in the initial state, and `ans` is set to 1.
