Postcondition: `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 2`, `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing either the original value of `i` followed by `x // i` if `x // i <= k`, otherwise `l` remains a list with one element which is `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value in list `l`.
