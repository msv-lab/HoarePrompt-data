Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer from the input, and `n` is an integer from the input.**

The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
