Output State: The loop will continue to iterate over the range starting from `i=1` up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. After all iterations, the variable `ans` will hold the maximum value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`. The value of `i` will be the last integer it iterated through, which is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. The variable `x` and `n` will retain their original values from the initial state. The list `l` will not be explicitly mentioned in the final state since its contents are used to update `ans`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will store the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` will be the last number checked in the range from 1 to the square root of `x` plus one. The values of `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial values.
