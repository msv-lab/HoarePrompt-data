Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    k = x // n
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            l = [ans]
            if i <= k:
                l.append(i)
            if x // i <= k:
                l.append(x // i)
            ans = max(l)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The final value of `ans` is determined as the maximum value among all possible values of `i` and `x // i` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `int(x

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop will continue to iterate until `i` exceeds `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. At each iteration, `ans` is updated to be the maximum value among 1, the current value of `i`, and `x // i`. The final value of `ans` will be the largest factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` (where `k` is initially `x // n`), unless no such factor exists, in which case `ans` will remain 1.

The output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `i` is greater than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and the list `l` is not relevant since the loop's final state does not depend on it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `i` is an integer greater than or equal to the square root of `x` plus one, `x` is the original input integer, `n` is the original input integer, and `l` is a list containing the maximum value `ans` found during the loop's execution. Specifically, `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, where `k` is initially set to `x // n`. If `x` has multiple divisors that are equal to `ans`, all such divisors will also be included in the list `l`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `ans` will hold the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `l` will contain all such divisors including `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
