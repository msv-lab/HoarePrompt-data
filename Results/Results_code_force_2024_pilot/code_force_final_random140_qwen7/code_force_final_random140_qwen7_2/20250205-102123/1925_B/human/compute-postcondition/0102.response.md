Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list containing at least one element `ans`, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i == 0` is true, then no change is made to the list `l`. If `x % i == 0` is false, then no change is made to the list `l`.
