Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is an integer greater than or equal to the square root of `x` plus one.
- `x` is the original input integer.
- `n` is the original input integer.
- `l` is a list containing the maximum value `ans` found during the loop's execution. `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, where `k` is initially set to `x // n`. If `x` has multiple divisors that are equal to `ans`, all such divisors will also be included in the list `l`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to k, with k = x // n)**
