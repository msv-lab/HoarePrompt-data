Output State: **`i` is 6, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list containing the elements `[6, i]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 6) to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains the element `ans`, which is the maximum value in the original list `l`. Since the original list only contained `ans`, appending `i` (which is 6) to the list changes its contents to `[ans, 6]`. However, since `i` is 6, the updated list becomes `[6, 6]`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list with both elements being 6.
