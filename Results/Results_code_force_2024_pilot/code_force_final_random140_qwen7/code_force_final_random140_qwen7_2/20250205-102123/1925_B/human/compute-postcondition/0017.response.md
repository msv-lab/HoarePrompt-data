Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing 'ans', `i`, and `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum value in list `l`. If `x // i` is greater than `k`, then `l` remains unchanged, and `ans` retains its previous value.
