Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `x ** 0.5`, and the range function arguments.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until it reaches `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 1.
   - **Expression `x ** 0.5`**: This expression calculates the square root of `x`. For the loop to start, `x ** 0.5` must be a valid value, but since the loop starts with `i = 1`, this part doesn't directly affect the initial state.
   - **Range Function Arguments**: The range function is defined as `range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2)`. For the loop to execute, `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` must be a positive integer. Since `x` is an integer, `x ** 0.5` will be a non-negative number, and thus `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` will always be a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `ans` is already given as 1, and it is not directly involved in the loop initialization.
   - `t` is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `x` and `n` are used in the calculation of `k` (which is `x // n`), but they do not directly affect the loop initialization.
   - `k` is the result of `x // n`, but it is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given the above analysis, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i`, which should be set to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer**
