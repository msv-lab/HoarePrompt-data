Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `x`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `1`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

3. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `i` is initially set to `int(x)`.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is `x // n`.
   - `ans` is `1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` set to `int(x)`, and the loop condition is `i <= int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, we need to ensure that `int(x)` is within the range `[1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1]` for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `x`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` do not directly affect the loop execution based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure the loop can execute. We need to ensure that `i` (which is initially `int(x)`) is within the valid range for the loop to start.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer** (with the condition that `1 <= int(x) <= int(x ** 0.5) + 1`).

However, since `i` is set to `int(x)` initially, we need to ensure that `int(x)` is within the valid range for the loop to start. Thus, the state should reflect this initial value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer** (with the condition that `1 <= int(x) <= int(x ** 0.5) + 1`).
