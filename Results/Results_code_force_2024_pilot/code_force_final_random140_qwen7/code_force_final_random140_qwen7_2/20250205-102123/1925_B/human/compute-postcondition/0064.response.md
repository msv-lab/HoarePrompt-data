Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value among 1, `i`, and `x // i`, `x % (i + 1)` equals 0, and the list `l` is `[ans, i]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` was defined as `[ans]`. Since `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, appending `i` to `l` results in `l` becoming `[ans, i]`. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and the condition `x % (i + 1) == 0`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
