Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 2`, `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the original value of `i` followed by `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the integer division of `x` by `i` to the list `l`. Since `x` is divisible by `i + 2`, `x // i` will be an integer. The initial conditions of `i` being `i + 2`, `x` being an integer divisible by `i + 2`, and `i + 2` being less than or equal to `int(x)` remain valid. The list `l` now contains the original value of `i` followed by the result of `x // i`.
