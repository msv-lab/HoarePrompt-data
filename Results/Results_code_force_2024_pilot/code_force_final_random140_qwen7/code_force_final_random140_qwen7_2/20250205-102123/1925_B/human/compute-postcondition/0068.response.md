Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value among 1, `i + 1`, and `x // (i + 1)`, `x % (i + 2)` equals 0, and the list `l` is `[ans, i + 1]` if `i <= k`. If `i > k`, the values of `i`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `x % (i + 1)` remain unchanged, and the list `l` is still `[ans]`.**
