Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by the `_` variable, but since it is a placeholder, the actual control flow is determined by the condition `i <= int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. The relevant variables here are `i`, `x`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the loop will continue to iterate until `i` exceeds `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented and checked against the condition.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be set to a value that satisfies this condition.

5. **Final Adjusted State**: Since the loop will continue until `i` exceeds `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` must be set to a value just below `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given this analysis, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

- `i` is set to `int(x ** 0.5)`.
- `x` and `n` remain as input integers.
- `k` is still `x // n`.
- `ans` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- The list `l` is not relevant since its state does not affect the loop's continuation.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is int(x ** 0.5), `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is x // n, `ans` remains unchanged, and the list `l` is not relevant**.
