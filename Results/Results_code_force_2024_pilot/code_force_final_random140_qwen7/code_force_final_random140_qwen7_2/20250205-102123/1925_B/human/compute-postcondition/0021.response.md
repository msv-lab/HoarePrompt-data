Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` with an additional element `i`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is initially `i + 1`, `x` is an integer divisible by `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, the only thing that changes is the list `l` which now contains its previous elements plus the current value of `i`.
