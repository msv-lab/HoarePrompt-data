To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State
- The variable `ans` is determined as the maximum value among all possible values of `i` and `x // i` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `int(x)`.

### Print Statement
- The print statement simply outputs the value of `ans`.

### Analysis
- The value of `ans` is derived from the maximum of `i` and `x // i` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `int(x)`.
- For any given `x`, the value of `x // i` will be maximized when `i` is minimized. The smallest value of `i` in the range from 1 to `int(x)` is 1.
- When `i = 1`, `x // i` equals `x`.
- Therefore, the maximum value of `i` and `x // i` will always be `x` because `x // 1` is `x`.

### Conclusion
- Since `ans` is the maximum value of `i` and `x // i` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `int(x)`, and this maximum value is always `x`, `ans` will be equal to `x`.

### Final Output
Output: **x**
