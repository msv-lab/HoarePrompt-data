Output State: **`i` is int(x), `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. The first part is assigned to `x`, and the second part is assigned to `n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still the integer value of `x` from the initial state.
