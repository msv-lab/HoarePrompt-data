Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the range condition based on `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing 'ans', `i`, and `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum value in list `l`.
   - If `x // i` is greater than `k`, then `l` is a list containing 'ans' and `i`, and `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - The range condition for `i` is `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. Therefore, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`.
   - We need to check if `i + 1` is within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

Given that `i` was within the range at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. We need to ensure that `i + 1` is still within the range.

5. **Check the range condition**:
   - If `i` was the last value in the range (`int(x ** 0.5) + 1`), the next value `i + 1` would be out of the range, and the loop would terminate.
   - Otherwise, `i + 1` will be within the range, and the loop will continue.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only say that `i` will be incremented by 1. However, we need to ensure that the loop can continue, which means `i + 1` must be within the range.

6. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `i + 1` must be within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 1`.** 

To be more precise, we can express it as:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.**
