Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

# Annotated Program:
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are given, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()

        work = True
        
        while i < len(a):
            if work:
                ans += a[i]
                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
        counter = 1
        
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
        
        print(counter)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations. Therefore, `counter` will hold the maximum number of consecutive times the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` was met throughout the entire string `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, indicating that all characters in `a` have been processed. The variable `work` will remain `False` since the loop exits when `i` reaches the end of `a`. The variable `j` will be equal to `len(a) - 2`, as the loop runs from `0` to `len(a) - 2`. The variable `t` will be decremented to `0`, indicating that all `t` iterations of the outer loop have completed. The strings `ans` will contain the result of the comparisons made during the loop, and `n` will remain unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of binary strings), and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \). It then constructs a new string \( ans \) by comparing corresponding characters of \( a \) and \( b \) according to specific rules. After constructing \( ans \), it prints the string. Additionally, it counts the maximum number of consecutive times a specific condition (\( a[j + 1] == '0' \) and \( b[j] == '1' \)) is met in the string \( a \) and prints this count. Finally, it ensures all test cases are processed and outputs the results accordingly.
