Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `counter` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user, `b` is the stripped input from the user, `ans` is a string constructed by the rules specified within the loop, and `work` is False.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `counter` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the stripped input from the user, `ans` is a string constructed by the rules specified within the loop, `work` is False, and the current value of `j` satisfies either `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'` or `a[j + 1] != '0'` and `b[j] != '1'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `counter` is an integer. If the element at index `j + 1` in list `a` is equal to '0' and the element at index `j` in list `b` is equal to '1', then `counter` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `counter` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `a[j + 1]` equals `'0'` and `b[j]` equals `'1'`, then `counter` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
