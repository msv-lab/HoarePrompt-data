Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `work` is `True`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of list `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes `a[0]`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (though this increment is not shown in the code snippet, it is implied by the nature of the `+=` operation in this context). All other variables remain unchanged.
