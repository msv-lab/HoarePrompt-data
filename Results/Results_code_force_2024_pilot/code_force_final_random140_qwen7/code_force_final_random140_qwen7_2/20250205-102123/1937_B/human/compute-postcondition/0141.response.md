Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 5; `ans` is equal to `a[2] + b[4]` if `i` is 4, otherwise `ans` is equal to `a[2] + b[3]`; `ans` is increased by `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now either 4 or 5. The value of `ans` remains unchanged from its previous definition because the code does not directly modify `ans`. It only modifies `i`, which affects the condition under which `ans` was defined. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `i` and retains the original definition of `ans`.
