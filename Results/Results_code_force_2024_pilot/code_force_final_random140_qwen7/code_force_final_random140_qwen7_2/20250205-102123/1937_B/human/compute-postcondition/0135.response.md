Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 5; `ans` is equal to `a[2] + a[i]` if `i` is 4, otherwise `ans` is equal to `a[2] + a[2]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was initially 3, it becomes 4, and if `i` was initially 4, it becomes 5. The value of `ans` remains unchanged based on the updated value of `i`. If `i` is 4, `ans` is calculated as `a[2] + a[4]`; if `i` is 5, `ans` is calculated as `a[2] + a[2]`. The precondition that `len(a)` must be greater than 4 is still valid.
