Output State: **`ans` is updated to its current value plus `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, while `ans` retains its value updated to its current value plus `a[i]`. The initial conditions specified that `ans` was updated to its current value plus `a[i]`, and `i` remained unchanged before the increment operation. After executing `i += 1`, `i` is now one more than its previous value, but `ans` still holds the value it had after being updated.
