Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is `a[0] + a[2]`, `i` is `3`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` increments the value of `ans` by `a[i]`. Initially, `ans` is equal to `a[0]`, and `i` is `2`. So, `ans` becomes `a[0] + a[2]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it `3`. The other variables remain unchanged.
