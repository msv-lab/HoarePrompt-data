Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new variable `i` and assigns it the value `0`. This does not affect the values of `counter`, `j`, `b`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
