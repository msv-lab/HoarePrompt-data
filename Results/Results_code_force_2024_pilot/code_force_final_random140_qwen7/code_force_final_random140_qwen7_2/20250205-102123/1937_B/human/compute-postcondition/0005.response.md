Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user, `b` is the stripped input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `b`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` is updated to the stripped input value of `b`.
