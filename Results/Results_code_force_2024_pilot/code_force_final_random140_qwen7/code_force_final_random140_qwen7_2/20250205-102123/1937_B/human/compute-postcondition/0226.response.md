Postcondition: `ans` is updated to its current value plus either `a[i]` (if `i + 1` does not equal the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`), `b[i]` (if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`), or `a[i]` (if `i + 1` does not equal the length of `a` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`). `i` remains unchanged if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, or is increased by 1 if `i + 1` does not equal the length of `a`.
