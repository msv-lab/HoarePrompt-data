Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user, `b` is the stripped input from the user, `ans` is the string `a[0]`, `work` is True.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes `a[0]`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
