Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the string `b[0]`, `i` is 2, `work` is `False`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`counter`, `j`, `b`, `ans`, and `work`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
