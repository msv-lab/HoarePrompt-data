Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and two binary strings a_{1} and a_{2} of length n, where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'. The function returns a result based on the comparison of the two binary strings for each test case.**

Note: The actual logic for processing the test cases and comparing the binary strings is not described here, only the parameters and expected return values based on the provided constraints.
