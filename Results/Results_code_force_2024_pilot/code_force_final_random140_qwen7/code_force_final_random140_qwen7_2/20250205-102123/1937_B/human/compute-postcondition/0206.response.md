Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is `a[0] + a[2]`, `i` is `3`, `work` is `False`**.

The variable `work` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
