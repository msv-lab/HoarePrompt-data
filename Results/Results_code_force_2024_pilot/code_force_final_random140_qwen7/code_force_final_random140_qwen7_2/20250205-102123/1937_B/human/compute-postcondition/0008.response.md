Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user, `b` is the stripped input from the user, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True.**

The variable `work` is assigned the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
