Postcondition: **`i` is either 3 or 4, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user, `b` is the stripped input from the user, `ans` is the string `a[0] + b[2]` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, or `a[0]` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, or `b[0]` if `i` is 1, and `work` is False if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]` or if `i` is 1, otherwise `work` is True.**

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts of the if-else block. It ensures that the variables `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work` retain their respective conditions as specified in the if and else parts.
