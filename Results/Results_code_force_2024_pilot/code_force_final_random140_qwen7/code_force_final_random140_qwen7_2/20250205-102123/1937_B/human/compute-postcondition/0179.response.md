Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. This does not affect the values of `counter`, `j`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
