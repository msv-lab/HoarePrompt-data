Output State: **`ans` is updated to its current value plus `b[i]`, and `i` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `b[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` has been updated accordingly while `i` stays the same.
