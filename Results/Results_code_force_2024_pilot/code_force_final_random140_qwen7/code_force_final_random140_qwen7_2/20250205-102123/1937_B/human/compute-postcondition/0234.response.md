To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `ans` starts as an empty string.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `work` is initially `True`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i + 1 < len(a)` and `work` is `True`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - Append `a[i]` to `ans`.
     - Check if `b[i] < a[i + 1]`. If true, append `b[i]` to `ans` and increment `i` by 1.
     - If the condition `b[i] < a[i + 1]` is false, set `work` to `False`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop ends, `ans` contains the constructed string based on the rules described.
   - `i` is set to the index just beyond the last character processed in the loop.
   - `work` is `False`.

Given this breakdown, let's consider an example to illustrate the process:

Suppose:
- `a = "abc"`
- `b = "def"`

Step-by-step execution:
1. Initialize `ans = ""`, `i = 0`, `work = True`.
2. Loop starts:
   - Append `a[0]` to `ans`: `ans = "a"`.
   - Check `b[0] < a[1]`: `d < b` is false, so set `work` to `False`.
3. Loop ends because `work` is now `False`.

So, `ans` will be `"a"`.

Output: **a**
