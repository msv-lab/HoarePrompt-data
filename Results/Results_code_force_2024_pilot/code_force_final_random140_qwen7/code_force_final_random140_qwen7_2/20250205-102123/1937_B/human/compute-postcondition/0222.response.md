Output State: **`ans` is updated to its current value plus `b[i]`, and `i` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `ans` or `i`. Therefore, `ans` remains updated to its current value plus `b[i]`, and `i` remains unchanged.
