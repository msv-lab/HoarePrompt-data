Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user, `b` is the stripped input from the user, `ans` is the string `a[0] + b[2]`, `work` is True.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends `b[i]` to the string `ans`. Given that `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, we know that `i` is the last index of `a`. Since `i` is 2 (as `i + 1` equals the length of `a` and the length of `a` is 3), `ans` is updated to `a[0] + b[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
