Output State: **`i` is 3; `ans` is equal to `a[2] + b[3]`**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` increments `ans` by the value of `b[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans` is updated to be `a[2] + b[3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the initial state of `ans` being equal to `a[2]` is now updated to include the addition of `b[3]`.
