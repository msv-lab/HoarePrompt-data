Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is `True`**.

The variable `work` is assigned the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `counter`, `new_counter`, `j`, `len(a) - 2`, `b`, the stripped input string, `ans`, which is an empty string, and `i`, which is 0, remain unchanged.
