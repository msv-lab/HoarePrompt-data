Output State: **`ans` is updated to its current value plus the value of `b[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` remains updated to its current value plus the value of `b[i]`. The initial condition that `i` remains unchanged before the increment is now true after the increment operation.
