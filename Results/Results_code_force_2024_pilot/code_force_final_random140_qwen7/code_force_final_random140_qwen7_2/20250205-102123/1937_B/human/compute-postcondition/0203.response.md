Postcondition: `counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is either `a[0]` or `a[0] + b[i]` where `i` is 2, `i` is either `len(a)` or `2`, `work` is `True`, and if `i` is `len(a)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `ans` is the string `b[0]`, `i` is 2, `work` is `False`.
