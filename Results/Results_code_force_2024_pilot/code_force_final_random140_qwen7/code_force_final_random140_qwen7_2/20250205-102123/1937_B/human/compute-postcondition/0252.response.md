Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop condition is `range(len(a) - 1)`, which means `j` ranges from `0` to `len(a) - 2`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `counter` is either 1 or 2.
   - `ans` is constructed based on the comparison between characters in `a` and `b`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `work` is `False`.
   - `j` is 1.

3. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < len(a) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - Therefore, the next value of `j` would be 2.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `j` will be 2.
   - The other variables (`counter`, `ans`, `i`, `work`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

5. **Final State:**
   - `counter` remains either 1 or 2.
   - `ans` remains constructed based on the comparison between characters in `a` and `b`.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `work` remains `False`.
   - `j` is now 2.

**State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is constructed based on the comparison between characters in `a` and `b`, `i` is 1, `work` is `False`, `j` is 2**
