Postcondition: `counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is `a[0] + a[2]` if `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is `a[0] + a[2] + b[3]` if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, and `i` is either 4 or the loop/break condition is met, or `ans` is `a[0] + b[2]` and `i` is 3.
