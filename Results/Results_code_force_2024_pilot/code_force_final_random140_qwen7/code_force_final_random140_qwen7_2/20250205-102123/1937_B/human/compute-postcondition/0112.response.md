Output State: **`work` is False, `a` is updated to the stripped input string, `counter` is the total number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` was met throughout the entire string `a`, `i` is 0, `t` is still a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `b` remains unchanged, `ans` is equal to `b[0]`, `j` is one less than the length of `a`, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is initially set to 0, `ans` is updated to be the first character of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
