Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The postcondition at the end of the previous iteration is that `i` is either 3 or 4.
- `ans` is equal to `a[2] + b[3]` if `i` is 3, otherwise `ans` is equal to `a[2] + b[2]`.

### Loop Condition
- The loop condition is `while i < len(a)`.

### Analysis
1. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - From the postcondition, `i` is either 3 or 4.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Since `i` is either 3 or 4, for the loop to continue, `len(a)` must be greater than 4.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
   - However, since `i` is already either 3 or 4, it cannot be changed to satisfy the loop condition directly.
   - Instead, we need to ensure that `len(a)` is greater than 4.

### Conclusion
To allow the loop to execute one more time, `len(a)` must be greater than 4.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is equal to `a[2] + b[3]` if `i` is 3, otherwise `ans` is equal to `a[2] + b[2]`, and `len(a)` must be greater than 4.**
