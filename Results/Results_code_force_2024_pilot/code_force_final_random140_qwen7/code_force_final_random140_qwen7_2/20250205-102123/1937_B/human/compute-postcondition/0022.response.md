Postcondition: **`i` is 2 or 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user, `b` is the stripped input from the user, `ans` is the string `a[0] + b[2]` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` is the string `a[0]`, and `work` is False if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is True.**
