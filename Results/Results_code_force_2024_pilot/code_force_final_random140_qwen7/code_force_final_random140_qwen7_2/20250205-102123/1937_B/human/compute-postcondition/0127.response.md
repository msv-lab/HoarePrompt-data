Output State: **`i` is 4, `ans` is `ans` + `b[2]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 3 to 4. The value of `ans` remains as `ans` + `b[2]` since no changes were made to `ans` itself, only its definition. The initial state's condition about `ans` being `ans` + `b[2]` is preserved.
