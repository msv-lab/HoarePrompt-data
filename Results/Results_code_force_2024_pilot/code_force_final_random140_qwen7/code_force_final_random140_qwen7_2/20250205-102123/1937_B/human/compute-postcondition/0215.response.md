Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is `a[0] + b[2]`, `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to `2`. After executing the code, `i` becomes `3`. The values of the other variables (`counter`, `j`, `b`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
