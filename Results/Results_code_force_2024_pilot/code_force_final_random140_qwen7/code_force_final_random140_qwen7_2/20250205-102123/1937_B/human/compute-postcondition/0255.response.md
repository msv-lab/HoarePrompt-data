Output State: **`counter` is 1, `ans` is constructed based on the comparison between characters in `a` and `b`, `i` is 1, `work` is `False`, `j` is 2**.

Explanation: The line `counter = 1` updates the value of `counter` to 1. All other variables (`ans`, `i`, `work`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
