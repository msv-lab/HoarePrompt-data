Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is `a[0] + b[i]`, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `True`, and either `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += b[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the current value of `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` was initially set to `a[0]`. After the operation, `ans` becomes `a[0] + b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.
