Postcondition: `work` is a boolean, `a` is the stripped input string, `counter` is the total number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` was met throughout the entire string `a`, `i` is either the length of `a` or 2, `t` is still a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `b` remains unchanged, `ans` is equal to `a[0]` plus `b[i]` if `i` is equal to the length of `a`, otherwise it is equal to `a[0]`, `j` is one less than the length of `a`, and `i + 1` is greater than or equal to the length of `a` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`.
