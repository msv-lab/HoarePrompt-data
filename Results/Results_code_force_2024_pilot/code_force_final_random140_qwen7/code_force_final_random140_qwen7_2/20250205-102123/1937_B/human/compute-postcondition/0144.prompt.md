Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `work` is True, `a` is updated to the stripped input string, counter is the total number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` was met throughout the entire string `a`, `i` is 0, `t` is still a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `b` remains unchanged, `ans` is an empty string, `j` is one less than the length of `a`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `work` is a boolean, `a` is updated to the stripped input string, `counter` is the total number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` was met throughout the entire string `a`, `i` is either 2 or the length of `a`, `t` is still a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `b` remains unchanged, `ans` is equal to `a[0]` plus `b[i]` if `i` is equal to the length of `a`, otherwise it is equal to `a[0]`, `j` is one less than the length of `a`, and `i + 1` is greater than or equal to the length of `a` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]` if `work` is True. If `work` is False, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to `b[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is equal to `a[2] + b[3]` if `i` is 3, otherwise `ans` is equal to `a[2] + b[2]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `i` is either 3, 4, or 5; `ans` is equal to `a[2] + a[i] + b[i]` if `i` is 3, `a[2] + b[4]` if `i` is 4, and `a[2] + b[3]` if `i` is 5; `len(a)` must be greater than 4 and `ans` is increased by `b[i]` if `i` is 4 or 5.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
