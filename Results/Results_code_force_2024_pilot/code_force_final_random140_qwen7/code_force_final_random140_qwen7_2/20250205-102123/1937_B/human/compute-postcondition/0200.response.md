Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the string `b[0]`, `i` is 1, `work` is `False`**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` is updated to be the first character of `b`. After this operation, `i` is incremented to 1 (though this increment is not shown in the code snippet, it's implied by the nature of the `+=` operation in this context). All other variables remain unchanged.
