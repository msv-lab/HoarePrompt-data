Output State: **`counter` is 1, `ans` is constructed based on the comparison between characters in `a` and `b`, `i` is 1, `work` is `False`, `j` is 1.**

The code `counter = 1` sets the value of `counter` to 1. Since the condition `if a[j + 1] == b[j]` was not checked and no other operations were performed on the other variables, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
