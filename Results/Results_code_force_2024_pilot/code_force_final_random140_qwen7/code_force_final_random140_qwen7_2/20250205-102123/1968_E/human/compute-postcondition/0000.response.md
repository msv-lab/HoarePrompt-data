Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, inclusive**.

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, the input for `t` must also fall within its specified range. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is only determined later in the program.
