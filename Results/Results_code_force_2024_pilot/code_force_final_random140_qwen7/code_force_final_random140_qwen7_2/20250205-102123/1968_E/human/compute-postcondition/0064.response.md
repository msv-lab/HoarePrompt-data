Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive. The function does not return any value directly but implies it might perform some operations or return a result based on these inputs.**
