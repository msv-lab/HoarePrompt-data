Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 11, `i` is 2, `j` is 13.

Explanation: If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the loop will run until `j` reaches `n`, incrementing `j` by 1 each time. After the loop completes, `j` will be 13 (since it starts at 4 and increments 9 times to reach `n` which must be at least 11). The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
