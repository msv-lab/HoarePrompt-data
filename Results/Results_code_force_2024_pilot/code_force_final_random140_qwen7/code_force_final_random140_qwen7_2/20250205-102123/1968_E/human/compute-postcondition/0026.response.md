Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` must be at least 8.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 8.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`.

3. **Understanding the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `t-1`.
   - Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will execute `t` times.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `t` does not change within the loop, so `t` remains the same.
   - `j` is not affected by the loop, so it remains 8.
   - `n` is not affected by the loop, so it remains at least 8.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 8, `i` is 2, and `j` is 8**.
