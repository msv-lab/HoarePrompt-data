Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(4, n + 1)`. This means `j` should be less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` is an input integer with a current value of at least 4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is not equal to 3.
   - `j` is 4.
   - `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 4 and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since `j` starts at 4 and the loop increments it each time).
   - Therefore, `j` will become 5.
   - The condition `j <= n` must still hold true, so `n` must remain at least 5 (since `j` is now 5).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` must be at least 5.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` becomes 5.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 5, `i` is 1, `j` is 5**
