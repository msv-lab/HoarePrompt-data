Output State: **t must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, i is 3, and either j is 16 and n is greater than or equal to 4, or j remains 13 and n is 3.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (up to 3 times), the variable `t` remains within the range of 1 to 50 because the loop does not modify `t`. The variable `i` will be 3 since the loop iterates 3 times. Depending on the value of `n`, `j` will either be 16 if `n` is at least 4 (since the loop will run until `j` reaches `n` and `n` is at least 4, making `j` 16), or `j` will remain 13 if `n` is exactly 3 (as the loop will only run once, setting `j` to 8 and then stopping).
