The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 13.
- `n` is an input integer.

The `print('1 2')` statement simply prints the string `'1 2'`.

Since the values of `t`, `i`, `j`, and `n` do not affect the output of this specific print statement, the output will be the exact string provided in the print statement.

Output: **1 2**
