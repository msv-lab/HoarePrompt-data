Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a number greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 14.
- `n` is a number greater than 13.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Here, `str(j)` converts the integer `j` (which is 14) to a string. The expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` concatenates this string with a space in between and then concatenates it again with the same string `j`.

So, the output will be the string "14 14".

Output: **14 14**
