Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 3.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` from 1 up to `n-2`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The condition `n` must be greater than 3 ensures that the loop runs at least 3 times, which matches the given information.
