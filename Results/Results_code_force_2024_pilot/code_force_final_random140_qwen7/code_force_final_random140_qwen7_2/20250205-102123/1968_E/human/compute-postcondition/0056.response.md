Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 15.
- `n` must be greater than 13.

The `print` statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.

Here, `str(j)` converts the integer `j` (which is 15) into a string. Therefore, `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` results in the string "15 15".

Output: **15 15**
