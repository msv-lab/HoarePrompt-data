Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` must be at least 7.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 8.

The `print` statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `j` is explicitly given as 8.
2. The `str(j)` function converts `j` to a string, so `str(j)` becomes `"8"`.
3. The expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` concatenates the string `"8"`, a space `' '`, and another `"8"`.
4. Therefore, the result of the expression is `"8 8"`.

Output: **8 8**
