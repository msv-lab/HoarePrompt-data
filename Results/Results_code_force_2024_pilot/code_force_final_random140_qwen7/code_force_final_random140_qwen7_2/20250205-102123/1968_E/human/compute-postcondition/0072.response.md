Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is `t - 1`
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` must be greater than 3

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(' ')`.

The `print(' ')` statement simply prints a single space character. Since no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, and the values of `t`, `i`, and `n` do not affect the output of this particular print statement, the output will be a single space.

Output: ** **
