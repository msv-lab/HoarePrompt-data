Output State: **The loop will continue to decrement `t` until it reaches 0. Once `t` reaches 0, the loop will terminate. The final value of `n` will be the last input provided during the loop's execution, and `i` will be `n - 1`.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because the loop continues to decrement `t` by 1 each time it runs. The value of `n` will be the last integer inputted by the user during the loop's execution, as `n` is redefined with each iteration. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, which is the value of `n` minus one, since the last operation involving `i` is setting `i` to `n - 1` before printing.
