Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 8, `i` is 1, and `j` is 8.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `t` remains within the range of 0 to 50. The variable `n` is at least 8 because the loop increments `j` from 4 up to `n`, and it needs to execute 4 times to reach `j` being 8. The variable `i` remains 1 as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `j` is 8 because the loop runs until `j` reaches `n`, and since it needs to run 4 times starting from 4, `j` will be 8 when the loop completes.
