Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `j` set to 4 and iterates up to `n`.
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` is an input integer with a current value of at least 4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is not equal to 3.
   - `j` is 4.
   - `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 4 and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (to 5) and still be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 5.

5. **Update other relevant states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` must still be an input integer with a value of at least 4 and not equal to 3.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an input integer with a current value of at least 4, `i` is 1, `n` is not equal to 3, `j` is 5, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`**
