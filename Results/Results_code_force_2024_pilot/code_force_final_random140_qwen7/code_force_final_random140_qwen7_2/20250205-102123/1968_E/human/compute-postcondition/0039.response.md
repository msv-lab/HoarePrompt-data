Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 11, `i` is 2, `j` is 13.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `j` by 1 with each iteration. Since it prints the value of `j` starting from 4 up to `n`, after 3 iterations, `j` is 10. Therefore, to complete all iterations, `n` must be at least 11 (to include the 11th iteration where `j` will be 11). Hence, the final value of `j` will be 13 after the loop completes all its iterations. The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
