Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is 14.
   - `n` must be greater than 13.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from 4 to `n + 1`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Currently, `j` is 14, and `n` must be greater than 13.
   - Since `j` is 14, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 14.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `j` will be incremented to 15 (since `j` starts from 4 and increments by 1 each iteration).
   - `n` must be greater than 14 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `n` must be greater than 14**.
