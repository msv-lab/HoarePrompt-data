Based on the initial state provided, we know that `j` is 5 at the start of the next iteration of the loop. The print statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:
1. `j` is 5.
2. The `print` statement concatenates `str(j)` with a space and then `str(j)` again.
3. Therefore, the output will be the string "5 5".

Output: **5 5**
