Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 11, `i` is 2, `j` is 13.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `j` by 1 with each iteration, starting from 4 up to `n`. After 3 iterations, `j` is 10. Therefore, to complete all iterations, `n` must be at least 11 (since the loop will run until `j` reaches `n`, and we need `j` to reach 13). The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `i` remains 2 as it is not modified within the loop.
