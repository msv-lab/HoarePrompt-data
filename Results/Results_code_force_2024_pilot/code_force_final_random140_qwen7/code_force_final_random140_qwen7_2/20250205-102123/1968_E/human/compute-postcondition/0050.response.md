Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(4, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initially set to 13.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `[4, n+1)`. This means `j` should be at least 4 and less than `n+1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` is initially 13, it already satisfies the lower bound of the range (i.e., `j >= 4`).
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 13 because the upper bound of the range is `n+1`, meaning `n` must be at least 13 for `j` to reach up to `n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 13.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 3, `j` is 13, `n` must be greater than 13**
