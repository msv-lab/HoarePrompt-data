Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, and `i` remains 0.
