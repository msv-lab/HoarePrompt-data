Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(4, n + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is 14.
   - `n` must be greater than 13.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs for values of `j` starting from 4 up to `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 14, and `n` must be greater than 13.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 15.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, which means `n` must still be greater than 13.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 15.
   - `n` remains the same, so it must still be greater than 13.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `n` must be greater than 13**
