Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` must be at least 8.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 9.

The `print` statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `j` is explicitly given as 9.
2. The `str(j)` function converts `j` (which is 9) to the string "9".
3. The expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` concatenates the string "9" with a space and then with another "9", resulting in the string "9 9".

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string "9 9".

Output: **9 9**
