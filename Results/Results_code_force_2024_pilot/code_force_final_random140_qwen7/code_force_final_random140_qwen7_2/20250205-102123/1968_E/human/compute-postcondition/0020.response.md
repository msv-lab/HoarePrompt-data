Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 8, `i` is 1, `j` is 8.

**Natural Language Description:** After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains between 0 and 50, `n` has been incremented by 4 (since the loop runs from 4 to `n` inclusive, and it runs 4 times), `i` remains 1, and `j` is now 8 (as the loop increments `j` starting from 4 and runs 4 times).
