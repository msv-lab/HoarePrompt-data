Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 3, and `j` is 16. `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 13, as the loop continues to increment `j` until it reaches 16, and `n` must have been greater than 13 initially for the loop to complete.
