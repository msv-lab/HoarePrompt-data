Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for j in range(4, n + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is given as 8.
   - `n` is given as an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `4 <= n + 1 > j`. Given that `j` is 8, the condition simplifies to `4 <= n + 1 > 8`, which further simplifies to `n >= 7`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the value of `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 7. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `j`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should reflect that `n` must be at least 7.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 8**
