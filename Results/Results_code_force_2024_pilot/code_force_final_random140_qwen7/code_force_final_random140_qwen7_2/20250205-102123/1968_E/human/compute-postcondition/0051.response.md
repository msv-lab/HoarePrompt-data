Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 13.
- `n` must be greater than 13.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Here, `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then again with the string representation of `j`.

Given that `j` is 13, the expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` will result in the string `"13 13"`.

Output: **"13 13"**
