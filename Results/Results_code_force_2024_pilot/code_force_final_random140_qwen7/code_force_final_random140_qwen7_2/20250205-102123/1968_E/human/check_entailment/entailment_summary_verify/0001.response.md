### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the number of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It always prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - If `n` is 3, it prints `(2, 3)`.
   - If `n` is 4 or greater, it prints `(2, 4)` and then a series of coordinates from `(4, 4)` to `(n, n)`.

3. **Checking the Output for Different Values of \( n \)**:
   - **For \( n = 2 \)**:
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1\}\). This is correct.
   
   - **For \( n = 3 \)**:
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       2 3
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). This is correct.
   
   - **For \( n = 4 \)**:
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       2 4
       4 4
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\). This is incorrect because the maximum possible Manhattan distance for \( n = 4 \) should be 6 (e.g., between (1,1) and (4,4)). The current output only achieves 4 distinct distances.
   
   - **For \( n = 5 \)**:
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       2 4
       4 4
       4 5
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). This is incorrect because the maximum possible Manhattan distance for \( n = 5 \) should be 8 (e.g., between (1,1) and (5,5)). The current output only achieves 6 distinct distances.
   
   - **For \( n = 6 \)**:
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       2 4
       4 4
       4 5
       5 5
       6 1
       6 2
       6 3
       6 4
       6 5
       6 6
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\}\). This is incorrect because the maximum possible Manhattan distance for \( n = 6 \) should be 10 (e.g., between (1,1) and (6,6)). The current output only achieves 11 distinct distances, but the maximum should be 10.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for \( n \geq 4 \).

### Correctness: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the program does not correctly maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for \( n \geq 4 \). The provided outputs do not achieve the maximum possible distinct Manhattan distances for larger values of \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
