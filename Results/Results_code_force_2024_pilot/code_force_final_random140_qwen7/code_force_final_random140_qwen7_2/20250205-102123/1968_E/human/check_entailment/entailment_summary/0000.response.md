Reasoning:
1. The program processes multiple test cases as specified.
2. For \( n = 3 \), the program correctly prints the pairs "1 1", "1 2", and "2 3". This configuration maximizes the Manhattan distances for \( n = 3 \).
3. For \( n \geq 4 \), the program prints "1 1", "1 2", "2 4", and then pairs from 4 to \( n \). However, this does not necessarily maximize the set of Manhattan distances for \( n \geq 4 \).

For \( n \geq 4 \), the optimal configuration should include pairs like "1 1", "1 3", "4 3", and "4 4" as shown in the example for \( n = 4 \). The given program does not generate these optimal pairs.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the maximum set of Manhattan distances for all values of \( n \).

Correctness: **False**
