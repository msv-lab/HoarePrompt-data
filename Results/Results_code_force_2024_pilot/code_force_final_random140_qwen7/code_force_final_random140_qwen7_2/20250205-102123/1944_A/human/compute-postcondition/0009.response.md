Output State: The value printed by the loop after all iterations will be determined by the condition `n - k > 1`. If this condition is true for the last input pair `(n, k)`, the output will be `n`. Otherwise, it will be `1`.

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be either the last `n` if `n - k > 1` for that input pair, or `1` otherwise.
