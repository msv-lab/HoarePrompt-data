Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `new_input` is the next integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. It then reads another integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `new_input`. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the new variable `new_input` is introduced with the value of the next integer input.
