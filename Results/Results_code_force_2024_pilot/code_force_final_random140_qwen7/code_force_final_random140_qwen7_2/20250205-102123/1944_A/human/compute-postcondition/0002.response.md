Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.

We need to evaluate the expression `n if n - k > 1 else 1`.

Let's break it down:

1. The expression `n if n - k > 1 else 1` checks if `n - k` is greater than 1.
2. If `n - k > 1` is true, then the expression evaluates to `n`.
3. If `n - k > 1` is false, then the expression evaluates to `1`.

Since the values of `n` and `k` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the possible outputs based on the condition.

Output: **n if n - k > 1 else 1**
