To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `k` is the second integer input.
   - `new_input` is the next integer input (though it is not used in the print statement).

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(n if n - k > 1 else 1)
   ```

This statement uses a conditional expression to decide what to print:
- If `n - k > 1`, then `n` will be printed.
- Otherwise, `1` will be printed.

Given this, we need to consider two cases:
- Case 1: If `n - k > 1`, then `n` will be printed.
- Case 2: If `n - k <= 1`, then `1` will be printed.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for the output. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions provided.

Output: **n if n - k > 1 else 1 (where n and k are the first and second integer inputs respectively)**
