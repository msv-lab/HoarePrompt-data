Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. The function checks if `n` is within the range 1 to 100 and if `k` is within the range 0 to (n * (n - 1)) / 2. If both conditions are met, it returns a boolean value indicating whether the combination (n, k) is valid based on the given constraints. If the conditions are not met, it returns an error message indicating the issue.**
