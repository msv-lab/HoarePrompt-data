You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k > 1 else 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks if \( n - k > 1 \). If true, it outputs \( n \); otherwise, it outputs 1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no further inputs to process.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges.
   - If `n - k > 1`, it means that after destroying `k` bridges, there will still be more than one island reachable from island 1.
   - If `n - k <= 1`, it means that after destroying `k` bridges, Everule can only visit at most one island (which is island 1 itself).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program uses a loop to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then checks if `n - k > 1`. If true, it prints `n` (all islands are reachable). Otherwise, it prints `1` (only island 1 is reachable).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the program correctly handles the condition where `n - k > 1` and `n - k <= 1`.
   - However, we need to ensure that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, which should be `n - k + 1` if `n - k > 1`.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The current implementation prints `n` when `n - k > 1`, which is incorrect because it should print `n - k + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit. It should print `n - k + 1` instead of `n` when `n - k > 1`.

### Correctness:
**False**
