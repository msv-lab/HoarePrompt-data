You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k > 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k > 1 else 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have processed all input test cases. For each test case, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and the output will be `n` if `n - k > 1`, otherwise `1`. There is no specific value given for the final `new_input` as it is not defined in the provided loop, but it implies that after processing all inputs, there would be no further input to process.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, we will have processed all test cases. For each case, if `n - k` is greater than 1, the output will be `n`; otherwise, the output will be `1`. There are no further inputs to process after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks if \( n - k > 1 \). If true, it outputs \( n \); otherwise, it outputs 1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no further inputs to process.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is 1 and `k` is greater than 0. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, there is only one island, and destroying any number of bridges (even 0) will not change the fact that there is only one island. However, the program prints `n` if `n - k > 1`, which would incorrectly print 1 for `n = 1` and `k > 0`. 

For example, if the input is:
```
1
1 1
```

The expected output is `1`, but the program will output `1` which seems correct in this specific case. However, the issue arises when considering the general case where `n = 1` and `k > 0`. In such a scenario, the program fails to recognize that only one island exists regardless of the value of `k`.

To fix this, the condition should be adjusted to handle the case where `n` is 1 separately:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n if n - k > 1 else 1)
```

This adjustment ensures that the program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1 and `k` is greater than 0.
