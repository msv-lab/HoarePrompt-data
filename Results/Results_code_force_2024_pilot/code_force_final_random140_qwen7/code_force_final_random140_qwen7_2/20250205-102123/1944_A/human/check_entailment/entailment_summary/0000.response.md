Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the `func` function aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We have \( n \) islands, initially fully connected by bridges.
   - Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges.
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit after optimal bridge destruction by Dominater.

2. **Key Points from the Problem**:
   - If \( n - k > 1 \), Everule can still visit more than one island because there are enough bridges left to connect at least two islands.
   - If \( n - k \leq 1 \), Everule can only visit one island (island 1) because the bridges connecting to other islands are destroyed.

3. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( n - k > 1 \). If true, it prints \( n \); otherwise, it prints 1.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **Case 1**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 0 \)
     - \( n - k = 2 - 0 = 2 \), which is greater than 1. Output: 2 (correct).
   - **Case 2**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 1 \)
     - \( n - k = 2 - 1 = 1 \), which is not greater than 1. Output: 1 (correct).
   - **Case 3**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 1 \)
     - \( n - k = 4 - 1 = 3 \), which is greater than 1. Output: 4 (correct).
   - **Case 4**: \( n = 5 \), \( k = 10 \)
     - \( n - k = 5 - 10 = -5 \), which is less than 1. Output: 1 (correct).
   - **Case 5**: \( n = 5 \), \( k = 3 \)
     - \( n - k = 5 - 3 = 2 \), which is greater than 1. Output: 5 (correct).
   - **Case 6**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 4 \)
     - \( n - k = 4 - 4 = 0 \), which is not greater than 1. Output: 1 (correct).

Given the analysis, the function correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and matches the expected outputs for all provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
