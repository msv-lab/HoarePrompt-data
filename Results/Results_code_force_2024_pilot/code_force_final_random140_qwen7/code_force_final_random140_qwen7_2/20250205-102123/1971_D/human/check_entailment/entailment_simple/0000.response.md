Reasoning:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string. This count is used to determine the number of cuts needed. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for all possible ways to cut the string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

For example, consider the string "1010". According to the current logic, there would be 2 occurrences of '1' followed by '0', leading to 3 cuts (since `cut + 1` is printed). But the correct answer should be 2 cuts, as we can cut the string into "10" and "10".

The correct approach should be to identify the last position of '0' and the first position of '1' after the last '0'. The number of cuts required would be the index of the first '1' after the last '0' plus one.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
