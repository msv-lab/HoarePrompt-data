Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program only counts the number of places where '1' is immediately followed by '0'. This approach fails to account for cases where the string can be sorted with fewer cuts.

For example, consider the input `0110`. According to the problem statement, the correct answer should be `2` because we can cut the string into `"01"` and `"10"`, and then rearrange these pieces to form a sorted binary string `"0011"`. However, the current implementation would incorrectly count this as needing `3` cuts (`cut += 1` at index `1` and `2`).

A correct approach would involve counting the number of '1's before the first '0' appears and considering the entire string as one piece if there are no '0's. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        # Count the number of '1's before the first '0'
        first_zero_index = next((i for i, char in enumerate(a) if char == '0'), len(a))
        num_ones_before_first_zero = sum(1 for i in range(first_zero_index) if a[i] == '1')
        
        # If there are no '0's, the whole string is one piece
        if first_zero_index == len(a):
            num_pieces = 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, the number of pieces is the number of '1's before the first '0' plus one
            num_pieces = num_ones_before_first_zero + 1
        
        print(num_pieces)
```

This corrected function should provide the right solution for the given problem.
