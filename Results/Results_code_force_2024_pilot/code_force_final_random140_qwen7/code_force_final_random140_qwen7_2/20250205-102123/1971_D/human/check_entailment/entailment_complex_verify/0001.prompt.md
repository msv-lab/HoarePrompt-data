You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        print(cut + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        
        print(cut + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is an input string where the total count of occurrences where '1' is immediately followed by '0' is stored in `cut`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, and `t` is the initial input integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `cut` will hold the total count of occurrences where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) - 2`, so the final value of `i` will be `len(a) - 2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was the initial input integer specifying how many times the outer loop should run, but since we are considering the inner loop's behavior, it does not affect the final state of `a` and `cut`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of times '1' is immediately followed by '0' in the string `s`. It then prints the count plus one for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - A variable `cut` is initialized to 0. This will count the number of cuts needed.

3. **Loop Through String**:
   - The program iterates through the string `a` using a for loop from index 0 to `len(a) - 2`.
   - In each iteration, it checks if the current character `a[i]` is '1' and the next character `a[i + 1]` is '0'.
   - If this condition is met, it increments the `cut` counter.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints `cut + 1`, which is the number of pieces required.

### Reasoning

The logic of the program aims to count the number of places where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0'. Each such place indicates a potential cut point. However, there are some edge cases and scenarios that the current logic might not handle correctly:

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not consider the possibility that the entire string could be sorted without any cuts if it starts with all '0's and ends with all '1's.
   - The program also does not handle strings that are already sorted (all '0's followed by all '1's).

2. **Correct Counting**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0', but it might not always give the minimum number of pieces required.

### Example Analysis

- **Test Case "11010"**:
  - The program would count the transition at index 2 ('10') and print `cut + 1 = 2`. However, the correct answer should be 3 because we need to cut it into three parts: "11", "0", "10".

- **Test Case "00000000"**:
  - The program would print `cut + 1 = 1` because there are no transitions. The correct answer is 1 since no cuts are needed.

- **Test Case "1"**:
  - The program would print `cut + 1 = 1` because there are no transitions. The correct answer is 1 since no cuts are needed.

- **Test Case "10"**:
  - The program would print `cut + 1 = 2` because there is one transition. The correct answer is 2 because we need to cut it into two parts: "1", "0".

- **Test Case "0001111"**:
  - The program would print `cut + 1 = 1` because there are no transitions. The correct answer is 1 since no cuts are needed.

- **Test Case "0110"**:
  - The program would print `cut + 1 = 2` because there is one transition. The correct answer is 2 because we need to cut it into two parts: "01", "10".

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not always provide the minimum number of pieces required. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
