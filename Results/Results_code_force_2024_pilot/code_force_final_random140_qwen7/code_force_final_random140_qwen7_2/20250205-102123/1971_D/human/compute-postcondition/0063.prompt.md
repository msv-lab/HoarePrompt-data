You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        
        print(cut + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is an input string where the total count of occurrences where '1' is immediately followed by '0' is stored in `cut`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, and `t` is the initial input integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `cut` will hold the total count of occurrences where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) - 2`, so the final value of `i` will be `len(a) - 2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was the initial input integer specifying how many times the outer loop should run, but since we are considering the inner loop's behavior, it does not affect the final state of `a` and `cut`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a test case where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `s` is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500. The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for `t` and `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
