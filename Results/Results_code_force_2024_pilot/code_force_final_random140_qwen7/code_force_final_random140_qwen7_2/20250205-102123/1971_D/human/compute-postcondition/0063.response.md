Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of times '1' is immediately followed by '0' in the string `s`. It then prints the count plus one for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.**
