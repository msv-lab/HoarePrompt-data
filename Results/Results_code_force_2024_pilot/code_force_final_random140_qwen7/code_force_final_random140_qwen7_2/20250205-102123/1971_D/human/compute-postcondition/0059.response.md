Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a list with more than one element.
   - `i` is set to `len(a) - 2`, meaning `i` is the index of the second-to-last element in the list `a`.
   - `cut` is the total number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet `print(cut + 1)` will execute and print the value of `cut + 1`.

3. **Determine `cut`**:
   - `cut` counts the number of times '1' is immediately followed by '0' in the list `a`.
   - Since the exact content of `a` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `cut`. However, we know it is a count of specific occurrences in the list.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output `cut + 1`.

Given the above steps, the output will be:

Output: **cut + 1 (where cut is the count of '1' followed by '0' in the list a)**
