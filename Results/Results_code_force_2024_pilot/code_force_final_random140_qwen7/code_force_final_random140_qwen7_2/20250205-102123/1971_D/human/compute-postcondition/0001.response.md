State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is not relevant as it is a dummy variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` and the dummy variable `_`.
- The value of `_` is irrelevant as it is used as a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.
- The variable `t` determines whether the loop will execute. For the loop to run, `t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.
