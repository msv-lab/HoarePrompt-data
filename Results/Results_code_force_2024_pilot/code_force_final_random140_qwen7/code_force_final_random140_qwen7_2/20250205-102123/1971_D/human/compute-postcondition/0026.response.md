Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user, `i` is 0, `cut` is 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code `cut += 1` increments the value of `cut` by 1. Initially, `cut` is not defined, so it is implicitly set to 0 before the increment operation. After executing the code, `cut` becomes 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
