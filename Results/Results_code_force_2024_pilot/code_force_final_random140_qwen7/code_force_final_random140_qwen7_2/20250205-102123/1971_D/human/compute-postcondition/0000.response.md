Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, after executing the code, `t` will retain its value as an integer within this range, and no other variables are affected.
