Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Given Information**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The loop body increments `cut` if `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0'.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 2.
   - The value of `len(a) - 1` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be set to 2.
   - The condition `len(a) - 1` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `len(a) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 2**
