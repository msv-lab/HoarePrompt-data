State: **`cut` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` must have more than 1 element** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(a) - 1`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `i < len(a) - 1` must be true.
3. Initially, `i` is set to 0.
4. Therefore, `len(a) - 1` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.
5. This means `a` must have more than 1 element.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
