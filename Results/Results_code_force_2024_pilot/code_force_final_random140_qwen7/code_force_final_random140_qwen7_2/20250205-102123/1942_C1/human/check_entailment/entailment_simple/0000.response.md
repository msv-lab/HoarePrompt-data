Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`. Since `y = 0` for this version of the problem, `y` is effectively ignored in the code.
3. It then reads the chosen vertices and stores them in an array `arr`.
4. The array `arr` is sorted and a dummy element `n + arr[0]` is appended to handle the circular nature of the polygon.
5. The variable `ans` is initialized to `x - 2`, which represents the initial number of triangles that can be formed using the given vertices.
6. The loop iterates through the sorted array to count additional triangles that can be formed when consecutive vertices are exactly 2 apart.
7. Finally, the result is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program appears to correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out. The provided example test cases also match the expected outputs.

Correctness: **True**
