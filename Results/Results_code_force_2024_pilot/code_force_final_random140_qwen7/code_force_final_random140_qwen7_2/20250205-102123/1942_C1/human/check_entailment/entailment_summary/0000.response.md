Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`. Since `y` is always 0, it is not used in the logic.
3. It reads and processes `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.
4. The program sorts these `x` vertices and appends `n + arr[0]` to the list, which is a valid operation.
5. It then calculates the number of triangular pieces by counting the number of pairs of consecutive vertices that differ by 2.
6. This approach is correct because any set of three consecutive vertices can form a triangle, and the logic correctly counts such sets.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program logic matches the requirements and correctly computes the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Correctness: **True**
