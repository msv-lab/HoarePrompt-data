Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, and the current value of `__name__` is `'__main__'`; `arr` is a list of three integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and each element in `arr` is converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]` iterates over the first `x` elements of the list `arr` (where `x` is not defined in the initial state) and converts each element to an integer. However, since `x` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact number of elements that are converted. But we know that `arr` originally contains three integers, and now each of these integers is explicitly converted to an integer type, which does not change their values. Therefore, the list `arr` remains a list of three integers, and the other variables retain their initial conditions.
