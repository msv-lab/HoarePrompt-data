Postcondition: **t is 0, x is at least 2*t, ans is the count of pairs (arr[j+1] - arr[j] == 2) for j in range(x-1).**

Explanation: Given the if part and the else part, we can deduce the following:

- If the condition inside the if statement is true (i.e., `i == 2*t` and `x >= t`), then `t` is set to 0 and `ans` is calculated as the count of pairs `(arr[j+1] - arr[j] == 2)` for `j` in the range from 0 to `x-2`.
- If the condition inside the if statement is false, then nothing changes, and the else part is essentially doing nothing.

Since the else part does not change anything, the overall postcondition is determined solely by the if part. Therefore, `t` becomes 0, `x` must be at least `2*t` (which simplifies to `x` being at least 0, but since `x` is always positive, this condition is always true), and `ans` is the count of specific pairs in the array `arr`.
