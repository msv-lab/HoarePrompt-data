Output State: **`i` is 6; `x` must be at least 5; `ans` is 1**

The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (but since no initial value for `ans` was given, we assume it to be 0 for calculation purposes). After the increment, `ans` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
