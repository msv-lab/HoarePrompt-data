Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 4, `ans` remains unchanged, `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. These strings are then stored in the list `arr`. The values of `i`, `x`, `ans`, `t`, and the initial values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged except that `t` is now `t - 1`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the integers obtained from the input split.
