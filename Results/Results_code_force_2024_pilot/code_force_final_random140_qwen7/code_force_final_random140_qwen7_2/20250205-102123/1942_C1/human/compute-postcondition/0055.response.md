Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is at least 4, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers with its first element unchanged and the last element increased by `n` plus the first element.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `arr`. This new element is calculated as `n + arr[0]`. Since `arr[0]` is the first element of the list, the new element added to `arr` is `n + arr[0]`. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged. The list `arr` is still sorted because the new element is appended, and the original order of the list is maintained except for the addition of the new element.
