Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, x, and y. It verifies that t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and the minimum of n or 2⋅10^5, and y is always 0. Additionally, it ensures that the sum of x across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. For each test case, it checks if the given conditions are met and returns appropriate validation based on these constraints.**
