Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 4, `ans` remains unchanged, `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `arr` is a list of length `x` containing integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by converting each element in the input split (which is a list of strings) into integers using a list comprehension. The length of `arr` is equal to `x`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged, while `t` is now greater than 0 but decreased by 1.
