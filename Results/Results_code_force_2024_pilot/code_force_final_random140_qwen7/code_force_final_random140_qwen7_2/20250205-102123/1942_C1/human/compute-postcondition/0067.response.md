Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`, meaning `i` starts at `1` and increments until it reaches `x + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 5.
   - `x` must be at least 4.
   - `ans` is 1 if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` equals 2. Otherwise, `i` is 5, `x` must be at least 4, and `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `6`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `x + 1`. Given that `i` is now `6`, `x` must be at least `5` (since `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `x + 1`).

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Based on the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is `6` and `x` must be at least `5`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 6, `x` must be at least 5**.
