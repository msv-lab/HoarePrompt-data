Output State: **i is 2*t, x is at least t, ans is the count of pairs (arr[j+1] - arr[j] == 2) for j in range(x-1), t is 0.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be twice the original value of `t`, since `i` increments by 1 each time through the loop and the loop runs `t` times. The variable `x` will be at least `t` because it's defined as being at least 4 initially and can increase with each iteration. The variable `ans` will be the total count of consecutive pairs in the array `arr` where the difference between two consecutive elements is exactly 2. Finally, `t` will be 0 because the loop condition `t > 0` will no longer be satisfied once `t` reaches 0.
