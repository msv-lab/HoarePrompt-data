Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`, meaning `i` will take values from `1` to `x` inclusive.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `i` is initially `4`.
   - `x` is a non-negative integer and at least `4`.
   - `ans` is `2`.
   - `t` is greater than `0` and decreased by `1`.
   - `arr` is a list of length `x` containing integers sorted in ascending order with the last element being `n + arr[0]`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` starts at `4`, it needs to be set to `1` to start the loop.
   - `x` should be such that the loop can run from `1` to `x + 1`. Given that `x` is at least `4`, it can be any value starting from `4` or higher.
   - The other variables (`ans`, `t`, and `arr`) are not directly related to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` must be `1` to start the loop.
   - `x` must be at least `4` to ensure the loop can run from `1` to `x + 1`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be at least 4**.
