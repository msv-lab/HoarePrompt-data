Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of the three integers originally in the input, `t` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, and the current value of `__name__` is `'__main__'`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `arr` using the `sort()` method. This method modifies the list in place, arranging its elements in ascending order. The values of `t` and `__name__` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation.
