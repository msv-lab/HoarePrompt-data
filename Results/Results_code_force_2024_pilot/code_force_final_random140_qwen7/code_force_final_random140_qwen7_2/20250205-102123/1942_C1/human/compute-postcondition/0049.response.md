The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 4, `x` is at least 4, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of length `x` containing integers sorted in ascending order with the last element being `n + arr[0]`**
