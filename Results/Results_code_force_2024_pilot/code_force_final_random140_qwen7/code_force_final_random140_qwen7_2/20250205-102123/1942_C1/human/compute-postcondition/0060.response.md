Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` must be at least 4, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is 2; `ans` is incremented by 1.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be initialized to 0 before this line of code. After executing the code, `ans` is now 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
