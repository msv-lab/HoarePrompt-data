Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `i` starts from 1.
   - `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - Since the loop condition is `i <= x`, `x` remains unchanged and must still be a non-negative integer and at least 1.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `x` remains a non-negative integer and at least 1.
   - The postcondition about `ans` does not affect the loop head variables, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 1**
