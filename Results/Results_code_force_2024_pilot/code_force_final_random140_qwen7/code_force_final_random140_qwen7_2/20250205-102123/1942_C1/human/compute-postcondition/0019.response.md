Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `x + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 1.
   - `ans` is 1 if `arr[2] - arr[1] == 2`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `x + 1`. Given that `i` is now 3, `x` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `x`. The value of `i` will be incremented to 3, and `x` must remain a non-negative integer and at least 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 3, and `ans` remains unchanged**.
