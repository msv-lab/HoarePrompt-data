Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `a[2 * (i + 1) + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `x` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. No variables are updated or affected by this statement, so the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as they were before the statement was executed.
