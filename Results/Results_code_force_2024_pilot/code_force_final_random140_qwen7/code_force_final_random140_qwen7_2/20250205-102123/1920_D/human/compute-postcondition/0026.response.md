Output State: **`i` is `i - 1`, `a[2 * (i - 1) + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `x`, and if `a[2 * (i - 1)]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop will continue.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration without executing any code within the body of the loop after the `continue` statement. Since no changes are made to the variables and the loop condition remains the same, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
