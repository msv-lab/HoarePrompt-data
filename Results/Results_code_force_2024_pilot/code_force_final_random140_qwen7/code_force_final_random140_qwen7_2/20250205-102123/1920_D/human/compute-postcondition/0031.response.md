Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers: the first integer represents the type of operation (1 or 2), and the second integer represents the value or the number of copies involved in the operation. The function returns a value from the list `b` at a specific index determined by the operations described in `x`.**

- If the loop encounters a condition where `x` is 0, it returns the value of `b` at index `a[2 * i + 1]`.
- If the loop completes all its iterations without `x` becoming zero, it returns the value of `b` at the final non-zero remainder obtained after repeatedly applying the modulo operation as specified within the loop.
