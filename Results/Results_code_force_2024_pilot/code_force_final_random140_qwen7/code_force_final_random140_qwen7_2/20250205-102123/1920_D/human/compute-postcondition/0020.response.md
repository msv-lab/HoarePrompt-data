Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` and returns an integer from list `b` at a specific index. If `x` is directly found in list `b`, it returns the corresponding element. Otherwise, it calculates a new value for `x` using `(x - 1) % i + 1` where `i` is the next element in the iterable `a`. It continues this process until `x` is found in list `b` or `a` is exhausted. If no valid index is found, it returns `None`.**
