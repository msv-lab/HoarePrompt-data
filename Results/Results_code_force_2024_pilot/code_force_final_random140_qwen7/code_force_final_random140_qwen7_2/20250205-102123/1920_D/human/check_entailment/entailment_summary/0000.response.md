Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves constructing an array `a` through a series of operations and then answering queries about the `k-th` element of this array.
2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over a series of operations, appending elements to the array `a` or duplicating it based on the operation type.
   - The `b` dictionary is used to store the last element of the array and its corresponding value.
   - The `a` list is reversed at the end, but this is not necessary since the original construction logic should suffice.
   - The `resolve_query` function is intended to handle the query logic, but the code provided does not actually implement this function. Instead, it seems like the intention was to use the `func_1` function, which is incorrectly named and not defined in the provided code.
3. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary describes a function `func_1` that is supposed to resolve queries by finding the appropriate value in the dictionary `b` or by iterating through the array `a` to find the correct position.
   - However, the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided in the code snippet, making it impossible to verify its correctness.
4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the provided code does not include the implementation of the `resolve_query` function, we cannot definitively determine its correctness.
   - The overall structure of the program seems to be on the right track, but without the `resolve_query` function, the program cannot be fully evaluated.

Given these points, the program cannot be determined as correct or incorrect based solely on the provided information. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
