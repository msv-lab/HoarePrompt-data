Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for handling the operations described in the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the appending of the array multiple times as specified in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The program uses `a[-1]` to track the current size of the array, but it does not correctly append the array multiple times as required. Instead, it tries to update `a[-1]` directly, which is not sufficient for handling the second type of operation (appending `x` copies of the array).

2. **Incorrect Logic for Query Resolution**: The function `resolve_query` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Even if it were defined, the logic for resolving queries based on the current state of the array `a` is not implemented correctly. The program does not maintain the correct structure of the array after each operation, making it impossible to accurately resolve queries.

3. **Potential Case Not Handled**: Consider the following sequence of operations:
   - Append 1 (a = [1])
   - Append 1 copy of the array (a = [1])
   - Append 3 (a = [1, 3])
   - Append 3 copies of the array (a = [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3])

   For a query asking for the 1st element, the program should return 1. However, due to the incorrect handling of operations, the program might return an incorrect value.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic and fails to handle the operations as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
