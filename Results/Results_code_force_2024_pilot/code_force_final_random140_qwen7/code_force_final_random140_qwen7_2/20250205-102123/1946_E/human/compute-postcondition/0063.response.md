Output State: **`ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, `cur` is 1, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, `i` is 4, and `M2` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by multiplying its current value by `nums_left` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The other variables (`cur`, `M1`, `nums_left`, `i`, and `M2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
