Output State: **The program returns ans, which is updated to its previous value multiplied by nums_left modulo MOD if i does not equal R[cur] during the last iteration, and cur is set to 3.**

This means that if `i` did not equal `R[cur]` during the last iteration, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `cur` is set to 3. The value of `ans` after this operation is returned.
