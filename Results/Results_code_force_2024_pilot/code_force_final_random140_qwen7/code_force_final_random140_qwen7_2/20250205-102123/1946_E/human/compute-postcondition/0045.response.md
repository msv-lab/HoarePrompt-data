Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, and `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nums_left` to `N - R[0] - 1`. The other variables (`cur`, `M1`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code. Additionally, the value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2.
