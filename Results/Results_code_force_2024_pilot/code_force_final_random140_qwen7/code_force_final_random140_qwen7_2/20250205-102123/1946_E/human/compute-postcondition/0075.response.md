Output State: `cur` is 3, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - N + 1`, `i` is `N`, and `M2` is greater than 1 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `N` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `N`. The variable `cur` will be 3 if `i` does not equal `R[cur]` during any iteration, or it will be incremented based on the condition inside the loop. Since `nums_left` decreases by 1 each time through the loop and the loop runs `N - R[0] - 1` times, `nums_left` will be `N - R[0] - N + 1` after all iterations. The conditions for `M1` and `M2` remain as described, with `M2` being greater than 1 unless `i` equals `R[cur]` at the last iteration.
