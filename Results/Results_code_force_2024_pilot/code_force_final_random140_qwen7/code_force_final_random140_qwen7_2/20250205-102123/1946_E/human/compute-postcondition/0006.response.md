Postcondition: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, M1 is an integer such that 1 ≤ M1 ≤ N, M2 is an integer such that 1 ≤ M2 ≤ N, L is a list of M1 integers in strictly increasing order where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N, R is a list of M2 integers in strictly increasing order where 1 ≤ R[i] ≤ N, and R is updated to a list of integers inputted by the user. Additionally, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, and either L[0] is not equal to 1 or R[-1] is not equal to N.**
