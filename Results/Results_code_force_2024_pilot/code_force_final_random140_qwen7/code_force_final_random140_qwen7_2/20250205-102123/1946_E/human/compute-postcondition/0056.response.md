Output State: **`ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, `cur` is 1, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is 3, and `M2` is greater than 1, and `N` is greater than 3, and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` updates the value of `ans` to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` and then takes the modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
