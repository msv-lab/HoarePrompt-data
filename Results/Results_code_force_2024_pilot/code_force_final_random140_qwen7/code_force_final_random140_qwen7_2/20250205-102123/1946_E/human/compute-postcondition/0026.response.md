Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1]` - 3, `i` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. Initially, `nums_left` was defined as `L[-1] - 2`. After decrementing, `nums_left` becomes `L[-1] - 3`. The values of `cur`, `M1`, and `i` remain unchanged.
