Output State: **`cur` is 3, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `i` is 5, `M2` is greater than 1 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `N` must be greater than 5.**

Explanation: The line `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Initially, `cur` was 2, so after executing this line, `cur` becomes 3. The other variables (`M1`, `nums_left`, `i`, `M2`, `ans`, `N`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
