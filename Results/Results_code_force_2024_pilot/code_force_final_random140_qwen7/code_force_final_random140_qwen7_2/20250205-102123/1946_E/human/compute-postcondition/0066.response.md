Output State: **`cur` is 2, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `i` is 5, and `M2` is greater than 1 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `cur` remains 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 4, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 5. The other variables (`cur`, `M1`, `nums_left`, `M2`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged according to the initial conditions provided.
