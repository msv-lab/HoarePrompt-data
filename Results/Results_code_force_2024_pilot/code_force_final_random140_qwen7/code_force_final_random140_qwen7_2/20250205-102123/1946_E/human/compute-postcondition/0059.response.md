Output State: **`cur` is 1, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, `i` is 3, and `M2` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The line `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. Since `nums_left` was initially `N - R[0] - 1`, after decrementing, it becomes `N - R[0] - 2`. The other variables (`cur`, `M1`, `i`, and `M2`) remain unchanged.
