Output State: **`ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, `cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is greater than 1**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` and then taken modulo `MOD`. The other variables (`cur`, `M1`, `nums_left`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
