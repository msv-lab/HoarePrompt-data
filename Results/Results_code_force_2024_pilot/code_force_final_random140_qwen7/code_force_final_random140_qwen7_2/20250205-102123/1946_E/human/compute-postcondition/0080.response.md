Functionality: **The function reads two lists of integers, L and R, and checks certain conditions related to their values and lengths. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a value `ans` using a series of multiplications and mod operations based on the elements of L and R, and returns this value.**
