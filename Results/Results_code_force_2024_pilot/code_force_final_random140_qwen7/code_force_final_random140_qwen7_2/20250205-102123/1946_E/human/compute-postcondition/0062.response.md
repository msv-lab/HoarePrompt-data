Output State: **`cur` is 2, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, `i` is 4, and `M2` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Initially, `cur` is 1, so after executing the code, `cur` becomes 2. The values of `M1`, `nums_left`, `i`, and `M2` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code.
