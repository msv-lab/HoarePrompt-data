Output State: `cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N`, `i` is 1, where N is the total number of iterations the loop executed.

To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the changes in the variables within the loop:

1. The variable `i` starts from `L[-1] - 1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it becomes 1. Therefore, after `N` iterations, `i` will be `1`.

2. The variable `nums_left` starts from `L[-1] - 2` and decreases by 1 with each iteration. After `N` iterations, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - N`.

3. The variable `cur` is decremented by 1 whenever `i` equals `L[cur]`. However, without knowing the exact value of `L[cur]` or the specific sequence of comparisons, we can only say that `cur` remains an integer but its exact value depends on the conditions inside the loop. Since no further information about `cur` is given, we keep it as "an integer".

4. The variable `M1` is not affected by the loop and remains greater than 1.

Thus, after all iterations, the output state will be as described above.
