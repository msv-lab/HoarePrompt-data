Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < N`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is 2
   - `M1` is greater than 1
   - `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`
   - `i` is 5
   - `M2` is greater than 1 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `cur` remains 1.

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `i` and `N`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`.

Given that `i` is currently 5, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than 5. Therefore, we need to adjust `N` to be greater than 5.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `N` must be greater than 5.
   - No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

Thus, the modified state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cur` is 2, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `i` is 5, `M2` is greater than 1 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `N` must be greater than 5**.
