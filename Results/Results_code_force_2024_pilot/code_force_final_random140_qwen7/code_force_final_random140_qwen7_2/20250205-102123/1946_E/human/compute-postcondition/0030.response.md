Output State: **`ans` is `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`, `cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`, `i` is greater than 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the modulus with `MOD`. The value of `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`, which remains unchanged. The other variables (`cur`, `M1`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.
