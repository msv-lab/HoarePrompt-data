The variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `N` is such that `i` is less than `N`. Since `i` is 4, `N` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

No other states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head conditions.

State: **`cur` is 1, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, `i` is 4, and `M2` is greater than 1, with `N` must be greater than 4**
