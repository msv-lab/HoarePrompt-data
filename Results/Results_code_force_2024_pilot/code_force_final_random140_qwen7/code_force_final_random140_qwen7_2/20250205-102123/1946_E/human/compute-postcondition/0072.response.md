Output State: **`cur` is 3 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `cur` is 2, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 4`, `i` is 5, `M2` is greater than 1 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `N` must be greater than 5.**

Explanation: The line `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. Since `nums_left` was initially `N - R[0] - 3`, after decrementing, it becomes `N - R[0] - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
