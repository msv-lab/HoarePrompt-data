Output State: `cur` is 3 (or 2 if `i` equals `R[cur]`), `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - N + 1`, `i` is `N`, and `M2` is greater than 1 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.

Explanation: The loop continues until `i` reaches `N`. Given that the loop runs for `N-3` times (since it has already run 3 times), `i` will be `N` after all iterations. If `i` equals `R[cur]` at any point, `cur` will be incremented. Otherwise, `ans` will be updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` modulo `MOD` on each iteration. After `N-3` iterations, `nums_left` will be `N - R[0] - (N - 3) = N - R[0] - N + 3 = N - R[0] - (N - 1)` which simplifies to `N - R[0] - N + 1`.
