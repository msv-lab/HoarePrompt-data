Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, M1 is an integer such that 1 ≤ M1 ≤ N, M2 is an integer such that 1 ≤ M2 ≤ N, L is a list of M1 integers in strictly increasing order where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N, and R is a list of M2 integers in strictly increasing order where 1 ≤ R[i] ≤ N, and the values of N, M1, and M2 are now set to the integers inputted by the user.**

The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The conditions and lists `L` and `R` remain unchanged.
