Output State: `cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - (L[-1] - 1)`, `i` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `i > 1`. After each iteration, `i` is decreased by 1. Therefore, if the loop executes until `i` becomes 1, it means `i` was initially `L[-1] - 1` and has been decreased by 1 for `L[-1] - 2` times. This results in `i` being 1 after all iterations. The variable `nums_left` is also decreased by 1 in each iteration, so after `L[-1] - 2` iterations, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - (L[-1] - 1)`, which simplifies to 1. The value of `cur` remains an integer and `M1` remains greater than 1 as they are not directly affected by the loop.
