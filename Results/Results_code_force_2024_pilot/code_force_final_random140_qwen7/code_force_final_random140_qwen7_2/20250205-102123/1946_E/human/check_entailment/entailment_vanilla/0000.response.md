Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates a specific value using factorials and modular inverses.
   - It takes two parameters `n1` and `n2`.
   - The function checks if `n1` equals `n2`, returns 1 if true, and returns 1 if `n2` is 0.
   - It initializes three variables `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to 1.
   - It iterates through numbers from 1 to `n1`, updating `f1` with the factorial of `i` modulo `MOD`.
   - Depending on the value of `i`, it updates `f2` and `f3` to intermediate values of `f1`.
   - Finally, it computes the modular inverse of `f2 * f3` and multiplies it with `f1` to get the result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the input for a single test case.
   - It reads three integers `N`, `M1`, and `M2` from the input.
   - It reads two lists `L` and `R` which represent the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively.
   - It performs several checks to ensure the indices are consistent with the problem constraints:
     - Checks if the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`.
     - Checks if the first index in `L` is 1 and the last index in `R` is `N`.
     - Checks additional conditions for consistency between `L` and `R`.
   - If any of these checks fail, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with appropriate arguments to compute the number of suitable permutations.
   - It then iterates through the indices in `L` and `R` to adjust the count of suitable permutations based on the positions of the indices.

### Verification

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the required value using factorials and modular inverses.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly processes the input and applies the necessary checks.
- The overall structure of the program handles multiple test cases as expected.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, the program appears to follow the correct logic for solving the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to handle the calculations and checks appropriately. Therefore, the given program should be correct based on the problem description.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
