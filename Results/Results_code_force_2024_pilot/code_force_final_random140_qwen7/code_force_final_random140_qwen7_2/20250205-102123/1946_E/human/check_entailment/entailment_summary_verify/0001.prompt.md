You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads two lists of integers, L and R, and checks certain conditions related to their values and lengths. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a value `ans` using a series of multiplications and mod operations based on the elements of L and R, and returns this value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates a specific value using factorials and modular inverses.
   - It takes two parameters `n1` and `n2`.
   - The function checks if `n1` equals `n2`, returns 1 if true, and returns 1 if `n2` is 0.
   - It initializes three variables `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to 1.
   - It iterates through numbers from 1 to `n1`, updating `f1` with the factorial of `i` modulo `MOD`.
   - Depending on the value of `i`, it updates `f2` and `f3` to intermediate values of `f1`.
   - Finally, it computes the modular inverse of `f2 * f3` and multiplies it with `f1` to get the result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the input for a single test case.
   - It reads three integers `N`, `M1`, and `M2` from the input.
   - It reads two lists `L` and `R` which represent the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively.
   - It performs several checks to ensure the indices are consistent with the problem constraints:
     - Checks if the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`.
     - Checks if the first index in `L` is 1 and the last index in `R` is `N`.
     - Checks additional conditions for consistency between `L` and `R`.
   - If any of these checks fail, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with appropriate arguments to compute the number of suitable permutations.
   - It then iterates through the indices in `L` and `R` to adjust the count of suitable permutations based on the positions of the indices.

### Verification

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the required value using factorials and modular inverses.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly processes the input and applies the necessary checks.
- The overall structure of the program handles multiple test cases as expected.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, the program appears to follow the correct logic for solving the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to handle the calculations and checks appropriately. Therefore, the given program should be correct based on the problem description.
