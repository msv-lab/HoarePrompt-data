### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and function summaries.

#### Function `func_1`
- The function `func_1` is designed to calculate a specific value using factorials and modular inverses.
- The formula used in `func_1` seems to be derived from combinatorial mathematics, specifically dealing with permutations and factorials.
- The function correctly handles edge cases where `n1 == n2` or `n2 == 0`.
- The loop iterates through numbers from 1 to `n1`, updating factorials and handling intermediate values `f2` and `f3`.
- The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

#### Function `func_2`
- The function `func_2` processes the input for a single test case.
- It reads the length of the permutation `N`, the number of prefix maximums `M1`, and the number of suffix maximums `M2`.
- It reads the indices of prefix maximums `L` and suffix maximums `R`.
- It performs several checks to ensure the indices are consistent with the problem constraints:
  - Checks if the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`.
  - Checks if the first index in `L` is 1 and the last index in `R` is `N`.
  - Checks additional conditions for consistency between `L` and `R`.
- If any of these checks fail, it returns 0.
- Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with appropriate arguments to compute the number of suitable permutations.
- It then iterates through the indices in `L` and `R` to adjust the count of suitable permutations based on the positions of the indices.

#### Overall Structure
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
- The main logic in `func_2` ensures that the input constraints are satisfied before proceeding with the calculation.
- The use of `func_1` within `func_2` is appropriate for calculating the number of suitable permutations.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program follows the correct logic and handles the problem as described.
