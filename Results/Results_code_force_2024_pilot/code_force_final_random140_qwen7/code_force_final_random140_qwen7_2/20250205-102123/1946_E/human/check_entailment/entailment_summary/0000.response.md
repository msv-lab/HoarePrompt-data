Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. The solution involves checking specific conditions and calculating the number of valid permutations using factorials and modular inverses.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the number of ways to arrange elements between two given positions in a permutation.
   - It uses factorials and modular inverses to compute the result, which is essential for counting permutations under constraints.
   - The function seems to correctly handle the calculation of the number of valid permutations between two specified positions.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - This function processes the input and checks if the prefix and suffix maximums are consistent.
   - It then calls Function 1 to calculate the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The function handles edge cases where the prefix and suffix maximums do not align, returning 0 in such cases.
   - The logic for iterating through the prefix and suffix maximums and adjusting the count of valid permutations appears correct.

4. **Overall Program Evaluation**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format and checks necessary conditions.
   - It uses the correct mathematical approach to calculate the number of valid permutations.
   - All the steps in the code align with the problem requirements and the example provided.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summaries.
