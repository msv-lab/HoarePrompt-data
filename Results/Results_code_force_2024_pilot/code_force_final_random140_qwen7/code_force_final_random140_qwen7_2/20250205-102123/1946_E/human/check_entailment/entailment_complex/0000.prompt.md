Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

    #
    #In natural language, this means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n1 + 1`. The variable `f1` will have been multiplied by every integer from 1 to `n1 + 1` modulo `MOD`. Consequently, both `f2` and `f3` will hold the same value as `f1`, which is the factorial of `n1 + 1` modulo `MOD`.
    a = pow(f2 * f3 % MOD, -1, MOD)
    return f1 * a % MOD
    #The program returns f1 * a % MOD, where f1 is equal to (f1 * (n1 + 1)) % MOD and a is equal to pow((f1 * (n1 + 1)) % MOD * ((f1 * (n1 + 1)) % MOD) % MOD, -1, MOD)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, n1 and n2, where n1 is an integer and n2 is an integer such that 0 <= n2 <= n1. It returns 1 if n1 equals n2 or if n2 equals 0. Otherwise, it calculates f1 as the factorial of n1 + 1 modulo MOD, sets f2 and f3 to the value of f1, computes the modular inverse of f2 * f3 modulo MOD, and returns the product of f1 and the modular inverse, all modulo MOD.

        #State: Output State: `cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N`, `i` is 1, where N is the total number of iterations the loop executed.
        #
        #To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the changes in the variables within the loop:
        #
        #1. The variable `i` starts from `L[-1] - 1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it becomes 1. Therefore, after `N` iterations, `i` will be `1`.
        #
        #2. The variable `nums_left` starts from `L[-1] - 2` and decreases by 1 with each iteration. After `N` iterations, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - N`.
        #
        #3. The variable `cur` is decremented by 1 whenever `i` equals `L[cur]`. However, without knowing the exact value of `L[cur]` or the specific sequence of comparisons, we can only say that `cur` remains an integer but its exact value depends on the conditions inside the loop. Since no further information about `cur` is given, we keep it as "an integer".
        #
        #4. The variable `M1` is not affected by the loop and remains greater than 1.
        #
        #Thus, after all iterations, the output state will be as described above.
    #State: `cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N`, and `i` is 1.
    nums_left = N - R[0] - 1
    if (M2 > 1) :
        cur = 1
        i = R[0] + 1
        while i < N:
            if i == R[cur]:
                cur += 1
            else:
                ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
            
            nums_left -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: Output State: `cur` is 3, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - N + 1`, `i` is `N`, and `M2` is greater than 1 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.
        #
        #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `N` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `N`. The variable `cur` will be 3 if `i` does not equal `R[cur]` during any iteration, or it will be incremented based on the condition inside the loop. Since `nums_left` decreases by 1 each time through the loop and the loop runs `N - R[0] - 1` times, `nums_left` will be `N - R[0] - N + 1` after all iterations. The conditions for `M1` and `M2` remain as described, with `M2` being greater than 1 unless `i` equals `R[cur]` at the last iteration.
    #State: Postcondition: `cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - N + 1`, and `i` is `N`. If `i` equals `R[cur]` during the last iteration, `cur` is 3 and `M2` remains greater than 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `cur` is 3.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is updated to its previous value multiplied by nums_left modulo MOD if i does not equal R[cur] during the last iteration, and cur is set to 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lists of integers, L and R, and checks certain conditions related to their values and lengths. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a value `ans` using a series of multiplications and mod operations based on the elements of L and R, and returns this value.
