Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of permutations based on the given constraints but seems to be implemented incorrectly.
   - It does not correctly handle the logic for calculating the number of permutations based on the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The function should use combinatorial methods to count the valid permutations, but the current implementation does not do so.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` checks some conditions to ensure the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums are valid, but it does not correctly compute the number of valid permutations.
   - The logic for counting permutations based on the prefix and suffix maximums is flawed and does not follow the correct combinatorial approach.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The solution uses `MOD = 10^9 + 7` for modulo operations, which is correct, but the overall logic for computing the result is incorrect.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The solution does not handle all edge cases properly, such as when there are no valid permutations due to conflicting constraints.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to implement a more accurate combinatorial approach to count the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. This involves using factorials and combinatorial mathematics to account for the constraints provided.
