Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the number of ways to arrange elements in a specific manner based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The logic seems correct as it uses combinatorial mathematics to compute the number of valid permutations. The function correctly handles edge cases where `n1 == n2` or `n2 == 0`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function processes the input and calls `func_1` to compute the result. It checks several conditions to ensure that the input indices are valid for forming a permutation with the given prefix and suffix maximums. The conditions checked are:
   - The last element of the prefix maximums list (`L`) should be equal to the first element of the suffix maximums list (`R`).
   - The first element of `L` should be 1 and the last element of `R` should be `N`.
   - Additional checks to ensure the indices do not conflict.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation, the indices of prefix maximums, and the indices of suffix maximums.
   - It then calls `func_2` to compute the number of valid permutations and prints the result.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic in `func_2` appears to correctly handle the constraints and conditions specified. The function `func_1` also seems to be implemented correctly to compute the necessary combinatorial values.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
