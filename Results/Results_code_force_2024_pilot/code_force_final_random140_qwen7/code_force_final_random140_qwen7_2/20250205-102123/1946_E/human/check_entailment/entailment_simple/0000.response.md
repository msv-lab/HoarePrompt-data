Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of permutations of length \( n \) that satisfy given prefix and suffix maximum constraints. The solution involves two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates a specific combinatorial value using factorials and modular arithmetic.
   - It correctly handles the base cases where \( n1 == n2 \) or \( n2 == 0 \).
   - The loop iterates through numbers from 1 to \( n1 + 1 \), updating factorials and computing the result using modular inverses.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the input and checks constraints on prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It correctly handles edge cases where the constraints are violated, returning 0.
   - The main logic involves calling `func_1` and adjusting the result based on the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases, processes each one, and prints the result.
   - The logic for checking constraints and calculating the number of valid permutations is sound.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles various edge cases, such as when the first or last element of the prefix or suffix maximum lists do not match the expected values.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the required combinatorial value under modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem statement and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
