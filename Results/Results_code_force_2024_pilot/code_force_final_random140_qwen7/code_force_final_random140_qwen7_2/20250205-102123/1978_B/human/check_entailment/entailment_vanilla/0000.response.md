### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal `k` (where `0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)`).
   - The profit calculation involves two parts:
     - Selling the first `k` buns at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins.
     - Selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` coins.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It initializes the profit as `n * a`, which is the profit if no promotion is applied.
   - If `a ≥ b`, the profit remains `n * a` because there is no benefit in applying the promotion.
   - If `a < b`, it calculates the optimal `k` and updates the profit accordingly.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The profit calculation for the promotional part is correct: `profit += (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.
   - The value of `k` is correctly set to `min(n - 1, b - a)` to ensure it does not exceed the available buns or the range `[0, b]`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `a ≥ b`, the program correctly outputs `n * a`.
   - When `a < b`, the program correctly calculates the profit using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to maximize Bob's profit based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
