Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers with the first element being `n`, the second element being `a`, and the third element being `b`, and `profit` is `n * a`, `k` is `b - a`.**

Explanation: The code `k = b - a` assigns the value of `b - a` to the variable `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0, `x` remains as a list with elements `n`, `a`, and `b`, and `profit` is still `n * a`. The new variable `k` is now `b - a`.
