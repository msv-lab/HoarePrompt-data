Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the second element of the list `x` to the variable `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `x` is still a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.
