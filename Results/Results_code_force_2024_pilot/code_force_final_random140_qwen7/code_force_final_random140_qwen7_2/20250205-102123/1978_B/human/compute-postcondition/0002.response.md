Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element into an integer, storing the resulting list in the variable `x`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0.
