Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a profit value based on the given conditions. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints the initial profit value `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates a modified profit value using the formula `profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2` where `k` is the minimum of `b - a` and `n - 1`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final profit values for each test case.**
