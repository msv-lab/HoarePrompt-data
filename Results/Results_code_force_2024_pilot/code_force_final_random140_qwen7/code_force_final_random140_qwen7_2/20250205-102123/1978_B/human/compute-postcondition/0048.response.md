Output State: `t` is equal to 0, and the output consists of the final profit value calculated for each test case after the loop has executed all its iterations.

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The output will consist of the final profit values for each of the test cases processed, printed during each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified within the loop body.
