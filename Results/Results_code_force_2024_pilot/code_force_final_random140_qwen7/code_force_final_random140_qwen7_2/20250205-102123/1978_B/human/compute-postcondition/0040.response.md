Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `x` is a list of integers where the second element is stored in `a`, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `k` is `b - a`, `profit` is `n * a`**.

The code assigns the value of `b - a` to the variable `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
