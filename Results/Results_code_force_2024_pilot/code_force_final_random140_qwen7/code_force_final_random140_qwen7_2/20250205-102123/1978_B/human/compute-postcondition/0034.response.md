Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input().**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of space-separated input from the user and converts each element into an integer, storing them in a list named `x`. The initial state of `t` being non-zero is unaffected by this operation. Therefore, `t` remains non-zero, and `x` is updated to be a list of integers based on the input provided.
