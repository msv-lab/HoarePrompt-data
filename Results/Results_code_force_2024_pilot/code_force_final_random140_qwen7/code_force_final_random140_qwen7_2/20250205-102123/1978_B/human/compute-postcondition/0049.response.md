Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes t test cases, where each test case includes three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation and returns the result accordingly.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a specified number of test cases (t) and for each test case, it takes three integers (n, a, b) as inputs and returns a result based on these inputs. However, since the specific operation is not detailed, the focus is on the structure and nature of the input and output as described.
