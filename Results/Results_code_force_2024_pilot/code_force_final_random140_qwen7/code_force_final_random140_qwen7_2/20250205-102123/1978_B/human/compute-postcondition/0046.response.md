Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers where the second element is stored in `a`, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is either `n * a` if `a >= b`, or `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2` where `k = min(n - 1, b - a)` if `a < b`.**

Explanation: The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. All other variables (`x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `profit`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The value of `t` is now `t - 1`, while the rest of the variables retain their original values and conditions.
