Output: **Yes**

Explanation: The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not needed to determine the output of the print statement. The print statement simply outputs the string 'Yes', regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` as long as they meet the given conditions. Therefore, the output will be 'Yes'.
