Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, t, 1):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, and `k` is the third integer input. If either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `itest` is `t`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `itest` is `t`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
