Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, and `k` is the third integer input. If either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than `k`.
