Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `itest` is `t`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
