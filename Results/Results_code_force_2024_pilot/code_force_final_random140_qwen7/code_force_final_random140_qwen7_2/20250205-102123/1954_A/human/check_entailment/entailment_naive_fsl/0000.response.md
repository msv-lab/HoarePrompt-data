Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `m` (the number of colors) is greater than `k` (the number of parts Bob can repaint). According to the problem description, if `m > k`, Alice can always paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 3 1
```

The output should be "YES" because Alice can paint the ribbon with three different colors, and Bob can only repaint one part, which is not enough to make all parts the same color. However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, which does not cover the case where `m > k`.

To fix this, the program should include a condition to check if `m > k` and return "YES" in that case. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if m > k:
            print('Yes')
        elif n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')

func()
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
