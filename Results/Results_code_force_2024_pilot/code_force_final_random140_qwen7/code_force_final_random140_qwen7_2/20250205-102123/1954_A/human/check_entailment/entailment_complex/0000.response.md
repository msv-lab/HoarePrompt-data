Reasoning:
The annotated program logic needs to be evaluated against the problem statement and the provided examples. Let's break down the conditions and see if the logic correctly determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The program checks if \( n \leq k \) or \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \leq k \).
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', indicating that Bob can always achieve his goal.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

2. **Condition 1: \( n \leq k \)**:
   - This condition means that Bob can repaint all parts since he can choose at most \( k \) parts and \( k \geq n \).

3. **Condition 2: \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \leq k \)**:
   - Here, \( \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \) represents the minimum number of distinct colors needed to ensure that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
   - If \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \leq k \), it means that Bob can still repaint enough parts to match the majority color, making it possible for him to achieve his goal.

4. **Examples Verification**:
   - **Example 1**: \( n = 1, m = 1, k = 1 \)
     - \( 1 \leq 1 \) is true, so it prints 'NO'.
   - **Example 2**: \( n = 5, m = 1, k = 1 \)
     - \( 5 \leq 1 \) is false, but \( 5 - \lceil \frac{5}{1} \rceil = 5 - 5 = 0 \leq 1 \) is true, so it prints 'NO'.
   - **Example 3**: \( n = 5, m = 2, k = 1 \)
     - \( 5 \leq 1 \) is false, and \( 5 - \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 5 - 3 = 2 \not\leq 1 \), so it prints 'Yes'.
   - **Example 4**: \( n = 5, m = 2, k = 2 \)
     - \( 5 \leq 2 \) is false, and \( 5 - \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 5 - 3 = 2 \leq 2 \), so it prints 'NO'.
   - **Example 5**: \( n = 5, m = 5, k = 3 \)
     - \( 5 \leq 3 \) is false, and \( 5 - \lceil \frac{5}{5} \rceil = 5 - 1 = 4 \not\leq 3 \), so it prints 'Yes'.

Given the analysis and the examples, the logic in the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
