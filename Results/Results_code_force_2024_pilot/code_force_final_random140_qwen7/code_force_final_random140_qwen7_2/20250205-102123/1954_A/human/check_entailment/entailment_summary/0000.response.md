Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
3. The condition `n <= k` checks if Bob can repaint all parts, which is a straightforward check.
4. The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` checks if Bob can repaint enough parts to change the color distribution such that all parts are the same color. This is because:
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of different colors needed to cover all parts.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, it means Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.
5. The logic correctly prints 'NO' if either condition is met, indicating that Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.
6. The logic prints 'Yes' otherwise, indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

Given the conditions and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that prevents Bob from making all parts the same color.

Correctness: **True**
