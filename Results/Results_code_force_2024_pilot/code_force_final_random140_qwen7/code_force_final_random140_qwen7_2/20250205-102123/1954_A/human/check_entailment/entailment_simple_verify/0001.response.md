### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` parts of the ribbon.
   - She can paint each part with one of `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to the same color.
   - Alice wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Fail:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color.
   - If `n - ceil(n / m) <= k`, this means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make them all the same color. Specifically, if `n - ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can still repaint the remaining parts to match the majority color.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Win:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `n <= k`: If true, prints 'NO'.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`: If true, prints 'NO'.
   - If neither condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Correctness of Conditions:**
   - The first condition `n <= k` correctly identifies when Bob can always repaint all parts.
   - The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is indeed correct. This condition checks if the number of parts that are not the same color (after distributing the colors as evenly as possible) can be repainted by Bob. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, then Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - Alice wins if `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) > k`. This ensures that even if Bob tries to repaint parts, he cannot make all parts the same color because there will always be some parts left with different colors.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified that the second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is necessary to ensure that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The first condition `n <= k` is also correctly implemented. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
