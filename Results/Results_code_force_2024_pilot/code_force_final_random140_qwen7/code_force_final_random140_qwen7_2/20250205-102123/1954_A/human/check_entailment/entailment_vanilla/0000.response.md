### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` parts of the ribbon.
   - She can paint each part with one of `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to the same color.
   - Alice wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Fail:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color.
   - If `n - ceil(n/m) <= k`, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. This means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make them all the same color.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Win:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `n <= k`: If true, prints 'NO'.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`: If true, prints 'NO'.
   - If neither condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Correctness of Conditions:**
   - The first condition `n <= k` correctly identifies when Bob can always repaint all parts.
   - The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is not correct. This condition should check if Bob can still make all parts the same color after Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible. Instead, it checks if the number of parts that are not the same color can be repainted by Bob, which is not the right approach.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - Alice wins if `n > k` and `n > ceil(n / m)`. This ensures that even if Bob tries to repaint parts, he cannot make all parts the same color because there will always be some parts left with different colors.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Alice can win. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
