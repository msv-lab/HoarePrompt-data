Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where one dimension is 1 and the other is greater than 1. According to the problem description, a 2x1 rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles and reformed into another rectangle, but the program incorrectly outputs 'yes' for such cases.

For example, consider the input `2 1`:
- The program checks if both dimensions are even, which they are not.
- It then checks if one dimension is even and the other is not equal to half of the even dimension, which is also not true.
- Therefore, it prints 'no', which is incorrect according to the problem description.

A correct solution would need to handle the special case where one dimension is 1, ensuring that the output is 'no' in such cases.
