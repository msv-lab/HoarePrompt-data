Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **Conditions for 'Yes'**:
   - The first condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` checks if both dimensions are even. If true, it prints 'yes'. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed.
   - The second condition `elif a % 2 == 0 and a / 2 != b or (b % 2 == 0 and b / 2 != a):` is also problematic. It incorrectly evaluates whether a different rectangle can be formed based on the division of the dimensions. This condition does not cover all necessary scenarios and may lead to incorrect results.

To correctly determine if a new rectangle can be formed, we need to consider the following:
- If either dimension is 1, no new rectangle can be formed.
- If both dimensions are even, we can always form a new rectangle by cutting the rectangle into smaller rectangles and reassembling them.
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, we can still form a new rectangle by cutting the even dimension into half and rearranging.

Given these points, the correct logic should be:
- Check if either dimension is 1, in which case print 'No'.
- If both dimensions are even, print 'Yes'.
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, print 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'No'.

The provided code does not fully cover these conditions and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
