The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: `t`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it checks specific conditions involving `a` and `b`. If the conditions are met, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
