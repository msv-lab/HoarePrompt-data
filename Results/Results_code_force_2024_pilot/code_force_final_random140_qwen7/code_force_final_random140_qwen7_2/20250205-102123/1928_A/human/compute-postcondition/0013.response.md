Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and the following conditions hold:
- If both `a` and `b` are even numbers, then the postcondition remains as per the if part.
- Otherwise, either `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`, or `a` is odd or `b` is odd, and if `a` is odd, `a / 2 == b` or if `b` is odd, `b / 2 == a`.
