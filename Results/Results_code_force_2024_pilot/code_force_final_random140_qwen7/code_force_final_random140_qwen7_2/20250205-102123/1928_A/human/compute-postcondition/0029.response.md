Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 9999 (since the loop runs `t` times), `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, and the loop has executed `t` times.**

In this final state, the variable `i` will have the value `t-1` because the loop starts with `i=0` and increments by 1 with each iteration. Since the loop runs `t` times, `i` will be `t-1`. The values of `a` and `b` remain the same as they were in the first iteration because the loop processes one pair of `a` and `b` per iteration and does not change these values within the loop. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the output consists of 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions provided for each pair of `a` and `b`.
