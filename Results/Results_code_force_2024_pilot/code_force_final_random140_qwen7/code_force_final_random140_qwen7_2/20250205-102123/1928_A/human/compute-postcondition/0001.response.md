Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is also unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the specified range, `i` is still 0, and `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.
