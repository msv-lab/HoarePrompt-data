Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, which is the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program constructs a list `a` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`.
   - It then iterates through the first half of the list (up to `n//2`), swapping elements in a specific pattern:
     - For even indices (`2*i`), it assigns `i + 1`.
     - For odd indices (`2*i + 1`), it assigns `n - i`.

3. **Handling Odd Lengths**:
   - If `n` is odd, the last element is set to `n // 2 + 1`. This ensures that the list has the correct length.

4. **Output**:
   - The constructed list `a` is printed using `print(*a)`.

### Verification Against Constraints and Examples:

1. **Divisibility Condition**:
   - We need to verify that for any pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) (where \(1 \leq i, j < n\) and \(i \neq j\)), neither \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) nor \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

2. **Examples**:
   - For \(n = 4\):
     - Constructed permutation: `[1, 4, 2, 3]`
     - Check pairs:
       - \(1 \nmid 4\), \(1 \nmid 2\), \(1 \nmid 3\)
       - \(4 \nmid 2\), \(4 \nmid 3\)
       - \(2 \nmid 3\)
     - Valid permutation.
   - For \(n = 3\):
     - Constructed permutation: `[1, 2, 3]`
     - Check pairs:
       - \(1 \nmid 2\), \(1 \nmid 3\)
       - \(2 \nmid 3\)
     - Valid permutation.

3. **General Case**:
   - The construction method ensures that no two consecutive elements have a divisibility relationship as required. This is because the elements are interleaved in such a way that no element in an even position divides any element in an odd position, and vice versa.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs a permutation of length `n` such that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) satisfy the condition that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\). Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
