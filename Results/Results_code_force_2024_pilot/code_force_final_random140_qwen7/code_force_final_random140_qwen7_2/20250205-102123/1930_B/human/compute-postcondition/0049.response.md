Output State: **The list `a` will be `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2+1, n//2+1]` if `n` is odd, or `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2]` if `n` is even.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, each element at index `2*i` in the list `a` will be `i + 1`, and each element at index `2*i + 1` will be `n - i`. This pattern continues until `i` reaches `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd, the last element will be `n//2 + 1` at index `n - 1`. If `n` is even, the last two elements will both be `n//2` at indices `n - 1` and `n - 2`.
