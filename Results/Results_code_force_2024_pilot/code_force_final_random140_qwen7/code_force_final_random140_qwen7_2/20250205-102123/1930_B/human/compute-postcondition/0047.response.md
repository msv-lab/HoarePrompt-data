Output State: **`a[2 * (i + 1) + 1]` is `n - (i + 2)`, `a[2 * (i + 1)]` is `i + 3`, `a[2 * i + 1]` is `n - i`, `a[2 * i]` is `i + 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[2 * i + 1]` to `n - i`. According to the initial state, `a[2 * i + 1]` was originally `n - (i + 1)`. After updating, `a[2 * i + 1]` becomes `n - i`. All other elements remain unchanged.
