Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each test case, it constructs a list \( a \) of length \( n \) based on the value of \( n \). If \( n \) is even, the list is structured as \([1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, \ldots, n/2, n/2]\). If \( n \) is odd, the list is structured as \([1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, \ldots, (n+1)/2, (n+1)/2]\). The function then prints the constructed list for each test case.**
