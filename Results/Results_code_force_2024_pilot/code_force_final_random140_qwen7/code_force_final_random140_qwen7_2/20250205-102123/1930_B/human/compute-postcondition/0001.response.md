Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input value} \leq 10^3\)**.

This means that the variable `t` retains its initial state as a positive integer within the specified range, while the variable `n` is assigned the value of the input integer, also within the same range.
