Output State: `n` must be greater than 13; `i` will be equal to `n // 2`; `a[2 * i]` will be equal to `i + 1`; `a[2 * i + 1]` will be equal to `n - i`.

After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n // 2` because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n // 2`. At that point, the loop terminates. Therefore, `a[2 * i]` will be `i + 1`, which simplifies to `n // 2 + 1`, and `a[2 * i + 1]` will be `n - i`, which simplifies to `n - (n // 2)`, or `n // 2`. All other elements of `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
