Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 7, `i` is 4, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is 2, `a[2]` is 3, `a[3]` is 6, `a[4]` is 7, `a[5]` is 4, `a[6]` is 4, `a[7]` is 5, `a[8]` is 5, and all other elements of `a` remain unchanged. The length of `a` is odd.**
