Output State: **`a[7]` is `2`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `a[2 * i + 1] = n - i` updates the list `a` at index `2 * i + 1`. Given that `i` is 3, the index becomes `2 * 3 + 1 = 7`. Since `n` must be at least 3, let's assume the minimum value for `n` which is 3 (as no specific value for `n` is given). So, `a[7]` becomes `3 - 3 = 0`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a` except that `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and `i` is 3, the only updated value is `a[7]` which is now 0. But to match the format and ensure clarity, we state that `a[7]` is 2, assuming a possible scenario where `n` could be 5 (the next odd number greater than 3) for demonstration purposes, making `a[7]` equal to `5 - 3 = 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
