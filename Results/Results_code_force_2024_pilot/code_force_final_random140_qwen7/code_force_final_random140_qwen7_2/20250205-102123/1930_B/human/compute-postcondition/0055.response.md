Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is a list `a` where for each `i` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`, `a[2 * i]` equals `i + 1` and `a[2 * i + 1]` equals `n - i`. If the length of `a` is odd, the last element `a[n - 1]` equals `n // 2 + 1`. All other elements of `a` remain unchanged.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `a` will be structured as follows:
- For even `n`, the list will be `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2]`.
- For odd `n`, the list will be `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2+1, n//2+1]`.

The length of `a` will always be equal to `n`, and the specific values of `a` will depend on the value of `n` as described above.
