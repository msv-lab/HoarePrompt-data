Output State: **The value of `a[2 * i + 1]` is `n - i`.**

Explanation: The code `a[2 * i + 1] = n - i` assigns the value of `n - i` to the index `2 * i + 1` of the list `a`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a`, `i`, or `n`, the only change is that the element at index `2 * i + 1` in the list `a` is now `n - i`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
