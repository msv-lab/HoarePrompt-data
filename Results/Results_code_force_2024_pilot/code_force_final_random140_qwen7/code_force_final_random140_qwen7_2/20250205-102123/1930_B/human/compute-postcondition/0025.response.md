Output State: **`n` must be greater than 13; `i` is `i + 1`; `a[2 * i + 1]` is `n - i`**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than 13 and `i` is `i + 1`. The code assigns the value of `n - i` to the index `2 * i + 1` in the list `a`. Since `i` is `i + 1`, the updated value of `i` is not explicitly stated, but it is known that `i` has been incremented. The value of `n` remains greater than 13, and the new value at index `2 * i + 1` in list `a` is `n - i`.
