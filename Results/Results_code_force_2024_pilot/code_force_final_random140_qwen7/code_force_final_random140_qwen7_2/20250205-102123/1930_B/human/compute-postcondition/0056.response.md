Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers: t (a positive integer between 1 and 10^3) and n (an integer between 3 and 10^5). It ensures that the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns a result based on the given t and n for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t` and `n`. It validates the constraints on `t` and `n` and processes them accordingly, returning a result for each test case.
