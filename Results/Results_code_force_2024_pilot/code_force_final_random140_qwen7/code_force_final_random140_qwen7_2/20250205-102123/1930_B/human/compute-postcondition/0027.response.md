Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 13.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `a[2 * i]` is `i + 1`.
   - `a[2 * i + 1]` is `n - i`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n // 2):
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n // 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n // 2`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.
   - We need to check if `i + 1` is still less than `n // 2` for the loop to continue.

5. **Conditions:**
   - `n` must still be greater than 13.
   - `i` must be less than `n // 2` (since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value is `i + 1`).
   - The values of `a[2 * i]` and `a[2 * i + 1]` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they stay the same.

6. **Final State:**
   - `n` must still be greater than 13.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `a[2 * i]` remains `i + 1`.
   - `a[2 * i + 1]` remains `n - i`.

Given these conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 13, `i` is `i + 1`, `a[2 * i]` is `i + 1`, `a[2 * i + 1]` is `n - i`**
