### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and the corrections made:

1. **Median Index Calculation**:
   - The original program uses `(n - 1) // 2` to calculate the median index, which is incorrect. The correct formula is `math.ceil(n / 2) - 1`.
   - The corrected version uses `ceil(n / 2) - 1` to ensure the median index is calculated correctly.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The original program increments the median index and the operations counter until the current value no longer matches the median value. This approach does not guarantee finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median.
   - The corrected version iterates through the array starting from the median index and increments the median value by 1 for each element that is less than or equal to the current median value. This ensures that the median is increased to the next possible value, minimizing the number of operations.

Let's analyze the corrected version step-by-step:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, a) = case
        a.sort()
        median_index = ceil(n / 2) - 1
        median_value = a[median_index]
        operations = 0
        for i in range(median_index, n):
            if a[i] <= median_value:
                operations += median_value - a[i] + 1
                a[i] = median_value + 1
            else:
                break
        results.append(operations)
    return results
```

- **Median Index Calculation**: Correctly uses `ceil(n / 2) - 1`.
- **Loop Logic**: Iterates through the array starting from the median index and increments the median value by 1 for each element that is less than or equal to the current median value. This ensures the minimum number of operations to increase the median.

Given the corrections and the detailed analysis, the program now correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The corrected program accurately implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
