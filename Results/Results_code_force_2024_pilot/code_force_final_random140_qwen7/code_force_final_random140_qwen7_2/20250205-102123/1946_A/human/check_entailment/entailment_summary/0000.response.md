Reasoning:

1. The program reads input and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly sorts the array `a`.
3. It calculates the median index and the median value.
4. It counts the number of trailing elements from the median position that are equal to the median value.
5. This count represents the number of operations needed to make the median strictly greater than its current value.
6. The program returns a list of these counts for each test case.
7. The execution summary indicates that the function processes each test case correctly and returns the expected results.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
