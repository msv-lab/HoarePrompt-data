Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n (the length of the array a) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (the array a). Each element of a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and the length n is between 1 and 10^5 inclusive. The length of `results` is 0, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, a = case
    a.sort()
    median_index = (n - 1) // 2
    median_value = a[median_index]
    operations = 0
    while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
        median_index += 1
        operations += 1
    results.append(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`; `operations` is the total number of times the loop has executed; `median_index` is the last index where `a[median_index]` was found to be equal to `median_value` and `median_index` is either equal to `n` or `a[median_index]` is no longer equal to `median_value`; `results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the value of `operations`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `median_index` is 3 more than its initial value, `n` must be greater than `median_index + 1`, `a[median_index + 1]` must be equal to `median_value`, and `median_index` is less than `n`; `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `operations` is 3, `n` is the last element in `test_cases`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 3`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index - 1]`, `results` contains 3, `case` is not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
