Output State: **`operations` is 2, `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases` and must be incremented by at least 1, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 2`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index - 1]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`**.

Explanation: The line `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Initially, `operations` was 1, so after this line, `operations` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
