Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least two test cases; `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the second test case in `test_cases`; `median_value` is now `a[(n - 1) // 2]`; `operations` is the total number of times the loop has executed plus 1; `median_index` is the last index where `a[median_index]` was found to be equal to `median_value` and `median_index` is either equal to `n` or `a[median_index]` is no longer equal to `median_value`; `results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the value of `operations`, and `n, a` are assigned the values from the second test case, with `a` being sorted.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns `median_value` to `a[median_index]`. Since `median_index` is defined as `(n - 1) // 2`, `median_value` is now `a[(n - 1) // 2]`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `a`, `operations`, `median_index`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
