Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`; `operations` is 0; `median_index` is increased by 1.**

The code increments the value of `median_index` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
