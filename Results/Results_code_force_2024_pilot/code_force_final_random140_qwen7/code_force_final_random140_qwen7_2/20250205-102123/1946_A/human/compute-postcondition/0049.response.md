Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `operations` is 2
   - `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases` and must be incremented by at least 1
   - `a` is sorted in ascending order
   - `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 2`
   - `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index - 1]`
   - `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration
   - `case` is the next element in `test_cases`

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition involves `median_index` and `n`.
   - `median_index` is fixed and does not change within the loop (it is calculated once).
   - `n` is dependent on the next element in `test_cases` and must be incremented by at least 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `median_index` is fixed and does not change, no adjustments are needed for `median_index`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be incremented by at least 1. Therefore, `n` must be greater than the next element in `test_cases` by at least 1.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`operations` is 2, `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases` and must be greater than the next element in `test_cases` by at least 1, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 2`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index - 1]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`**
