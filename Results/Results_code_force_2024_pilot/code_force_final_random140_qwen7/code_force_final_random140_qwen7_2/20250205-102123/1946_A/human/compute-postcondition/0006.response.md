Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`; `operations` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `operations` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables `test_cases`, `n`, `a`, or `median_value`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `operations` is updated to 0.
