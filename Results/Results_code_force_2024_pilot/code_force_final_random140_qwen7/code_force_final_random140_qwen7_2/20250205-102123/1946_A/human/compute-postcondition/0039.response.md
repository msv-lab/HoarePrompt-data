Output State: **`n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases`; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is 3 more than its initial value; `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index + 1]`; `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration; `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`n`, `median_index`, `median_value`, `results`, and `case`) remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `a` is now sorted.
