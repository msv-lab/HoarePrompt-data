Output State: **`operations` is 2, `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases` and must be greater than the next element in `test_cases` by at least 1, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 3`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index - 1]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`**.

Explanation: The code increments `median_index` by 1. Initially, `median_index` was equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 2`. After incrementing, `median_index` becomes `(n - 1) // 2 + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
