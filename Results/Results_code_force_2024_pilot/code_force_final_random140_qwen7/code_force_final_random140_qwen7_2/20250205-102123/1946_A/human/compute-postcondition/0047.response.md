Output State: **`operations` is 1, `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases` and must be incremented by at least 1, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 2`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index - 1]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`**.

Explanation: The line `median_index += 1` increments the value of `median_index` by 1. Since `median_index` was initially equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`, after the increment, it becomes `(n - 1) // 2 + 2`. Note that `median_value` is still dependent on `median_index`, so it now refers to `a[median_index - 1]`, which is `a[(n - 1) // 2 + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
