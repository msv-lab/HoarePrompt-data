Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least two test cases; `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the second test case in `test_cases`; `median_value` is now `a[(n - 1) // 2]`; `operations` is 1; `median_index` is the last index where `a[median_index]` was found to be equal to `median_value` and `median_index` is either equal to `n` or `a[median_index]` is no longer equal to `median_value`; `results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the value of `operations`, and `n, a` are assigned the values from the second test case, with `a` being sorted; `operations` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `operations` to 0. However, since the code only assigns the value 0 to `operations`, it does not change the value of `operations` that was previously set based on the second test case. Therefore, `operations` remains 1, as it was set before the code execution. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
