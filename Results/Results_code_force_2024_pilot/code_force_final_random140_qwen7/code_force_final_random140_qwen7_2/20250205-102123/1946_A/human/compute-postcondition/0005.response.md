Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at the index `(n - 1) // 2` in the list `a` to the variable `median_value`. The other variables remain unchanged.
