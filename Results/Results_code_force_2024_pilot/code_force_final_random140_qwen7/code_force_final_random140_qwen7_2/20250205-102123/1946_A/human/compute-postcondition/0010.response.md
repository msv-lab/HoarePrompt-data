Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `median_index < n` and `a[median_index] == median_value`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `test_cases` contains at least one test case.
   - `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`.
   - `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`.
   - `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`.
   - `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`.
   - `operations` is 1.
   - `median_index` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition involves two parts: `median_index < n` and `a[median_index] == median_value`.
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true.
   - `median_index` has been increased by 1, so the new value of `median_index` is `median_index + 1`.
   - To satisfy `median_index < n`, the new value of `median_index` must still be less than `n`.
   - To satisfy `a[median_index] == median_value`, the element at the new position `median_index` must still be equal to `median_value`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `median_index` is increased by 1, the new value of `median_index` should be `median_index + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `median_index + 1 < n` and `a[median_index + 1] == median_value`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `median_index` should be increased by 1.
- Ensure that `median_index + 1 < n`.
- Ensure that `a[median_index + 1] == median_value`.

State: **`test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`; `operations` is 1; `median_index` is increased by 1 and `median_index + 1 < n` and `a[median_index + 1] == median_value`**
