Output State: **`n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases`; `a` is updated such that `a[median_index + 1]` is equal to the next element in `test_cases`; `median_index` is 3 more than its initial value; `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index + 1]; `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration; `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.**

This means that the variable `n` and the list `a` are updated to the next element in `test_cases`. The `median_index` remains 3 more than its initial value, and `median_value` is set to the new value of `a[median_index + 1]`, which is the same as the updated `n`. The `results` variable retains the count of operations performed up to the current iteration, and `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`.
