Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `case`, which is being iterated over from the `test_cases` list.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: Since the loop is iterating over `test_cases`, the only object that needs to be adjusted is `case`. The state of `test_cases` itself does not need to be adjusted; rather, we need to ensure that there is at least one element in `test_cases` for the loop to execute.

3. **Understand the initial state**: Initially, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, and `results` is an empty list. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `test_cases`.

4. **Formulate the required state**: For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one test case. Therefore, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`test_cases` must contain at least one test case**
