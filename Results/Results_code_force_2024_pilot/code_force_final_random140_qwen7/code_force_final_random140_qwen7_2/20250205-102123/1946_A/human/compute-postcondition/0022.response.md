Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least two test cases; `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the second test case in `test_cases`; `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`; `operations` is the total number of times the loop has executed plus 1; `median_index` is the last index where `a[median_index]` was found to be equal to `median_value` and `median_index` is either equal to `n` or `a[median_index]` is no longer equal to `median_value`; `results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the value of `operations`, and `n, a` are assigned the values from the second test case, with `a` being sorted; `median_index` is updated to `(n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `median_index` variable to the value of `(n - 1) // 2`, which is the middle index of the sorted list `a`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
