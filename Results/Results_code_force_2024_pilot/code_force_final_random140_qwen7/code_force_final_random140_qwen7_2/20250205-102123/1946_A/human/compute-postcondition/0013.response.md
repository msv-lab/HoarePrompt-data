Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `test_cases` contains at least one test case.
   - `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`.
   - `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`.
   - `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`.
   - `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`.
   - `operations` is 2.
   - `median_index` is now `median_index + 1`.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition involves two parts: `median_index < n` and `a[median_index] == median_value`.
   - We need to ensure both conditions are met for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - For `median_index < n` to be true, `median_index` must be less than `n`.
   - For `a[median_index] == median_value` to be true, `a[median_index]` must be equal to `median_value`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `median_index` is currently `median_index + 1` (let's assume `median_index` was previously `0`), we need to ensure that `median_index` is still within the bounds of `a` and that `a[median_index]` is equal to `median_value`.

Given this, the states that need to be adjusted are `median_index` and `a[median_index]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`; `operations` is 2; `median_index` must be less than `n` and `a[median_index]` must be equal to `median_value`**.
