Output State: **`median_index` is 3 more than its initial value, `n` must be greater than `median_index + 1`, `a[median_index + 1]` must be equal to `median_value`, and `median_index` is less than `n`; `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: The `median_index` is incremented by 3 from its initial state. The conditions `n > median_index + 1`, `a[median_index + 1] == median_value`, and `median_index < n` still hold true. Additionally, the `operations` count, which represents the number of times the loop has iterated, is appended to the `results` list.
