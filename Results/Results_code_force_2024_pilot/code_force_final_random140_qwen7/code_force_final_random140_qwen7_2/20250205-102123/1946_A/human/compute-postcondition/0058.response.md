Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function sorts the array `a`, finds the median value and its index, and then counts the number of trailing equal elements from the median position. The function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case. After processing all test cases, the `test_cases` list is emptied.**

This means the function processes a list of test cases, each consisting of an array of integers and its length. It sorts each array, determines the median value and its index, counts the number of consecutive elements equal to the median from that index towards the end of the array, and collects these counts into a list of results. Finally, it clears the `test_cases` list.
