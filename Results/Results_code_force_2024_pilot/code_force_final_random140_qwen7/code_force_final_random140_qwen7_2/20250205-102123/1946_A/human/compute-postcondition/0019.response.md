Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `case` which is an element from the `test_cases` list.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**:
   - `test_cases` contains at least one test case.
   - `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`.
   - `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`.
   - `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`.
   - `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`.
   - `operations` is the total number of times the loop has executed.
   - `median_index` is the last index where `a[median_index]` was found to be equal to `median_value` and `median_index` is either equal to `n` or `a[median_index]` is no longer equal to `median_value`.
   - `results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the value of `operations`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each test case in `test_cases`, the next test case will be the current `case` plus one.
   - `n` will be the first element of the new test case.
   - `a` will be the sorted second element of the new test case.
   - `a[0]` must still be equal to `median_value` (since `median_value` is derived from `a` and `n`, and these do not change within the loop).
   - `median_value` remains the same as it is derived from `a` and `n` which do not change within the loop.
   - `operations` will increment by 1 since the loop will execute one more time.
   - `median_index` will remain the same unless the condition `a[median_index] == median_value` fails, but since we don't know if that happens, we assume it remains unchanged.
   - `results` will contain the updated value of `operations` as its last element.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`test_cases` contains at least two test cases; `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the second test case in `test_cases`; `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`; `operations` is the total number of times the loop has executed plus 1; `median_index` is the last index where `a[median_index]` was found to be equal to `median_value` and `median_index` is either equal to `n` or `a[median_index]` is no longer equal to `median_value`; `results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the value of `operations`.**
