Output State: **`operations` is 0, `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`**.

Explanation: The line `median_index += 1` increments the value of `median_index` by 1. Initially, `median_index` was equal to `(n - 1) // 2`. After incrementing, `median_index` becomes `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
