Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a`, which is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`. After sorting, `a` will contain its elements in ascending order. The values of `test_cases` and `n` remain unchanged.
