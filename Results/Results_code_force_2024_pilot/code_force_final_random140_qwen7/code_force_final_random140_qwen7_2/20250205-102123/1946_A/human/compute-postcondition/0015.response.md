Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`; `operations` is 3; `median_index` is now `median_index + 1` and is still less than `n` and `a[median_index]` is equal to `median_value`.**

Explanation: The code `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Initially, `operations` was 2, so after executing this line, `operations` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
