Output State: **`median_index` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `median_index + 1`; `a[median_index + 1]` must be equal to `median_value`**

Explanation: The line `median_index += 1` increments the value of `median_index` by 1. The conditions that `n` must be greater than `median_index + 1` and `a[median_index + 1]` must be equal to `median_value` remain unchanged. Therefore, these conditions are still valid after the code execution.
