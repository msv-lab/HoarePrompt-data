Output State: `operations` is 3, `n` is equal to the last element in `test_cases`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 3`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index - 1]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is not defined as it is not used after the loop.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `median_index` and `operations` until the condition `median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value` is no longer satisfied. Given that the loop executed 3 times, we can infer that `n` must be at least 7 (since `median_index` becomes `3` after 3 iterations, which means `n` must be at least `2 * 3 + 1 = 7`). After the loop completes, `median_index` will be `3 + 1 = 4` if `n` is exactly 7, or slightly more depending on the exact value of `n`. The `median_value` will be the value at `median_index - 1`, which is `a[3]` if `n` is 7. The `results` variable will contain the total number of operations performed, which is 3 in this case. The `case` variable is not used within the loop and is not defined in the final state.
