Functionality: **The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It sorts each list `a`, finds the median value and its index, and counts the number of trailing elements from the median position that are equal to the median value. The function returns a list of these counts for each test case. After processing all test cases, the `test_cases` list is emptied, and all other relevant variables reflect the final state of the last processed test case.**
