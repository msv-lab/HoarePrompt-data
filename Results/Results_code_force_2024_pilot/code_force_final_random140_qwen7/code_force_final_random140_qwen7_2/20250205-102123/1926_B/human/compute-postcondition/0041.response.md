Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution.**

The code `a = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
