Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, and `i` remains 0. The value of `n` is the integer input by the user.
