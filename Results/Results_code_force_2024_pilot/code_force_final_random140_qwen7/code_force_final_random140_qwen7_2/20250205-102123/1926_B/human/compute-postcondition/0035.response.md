Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, but the current value of `a` is not 0.
- `b` is 'Square'.
- `j` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

The print statement is `print(a)`. Since the current value of `a` is not 0 and it can only be 'Triangle' or 0, the value of `a` must be 'Triangle'.

Output: **Triangle**
