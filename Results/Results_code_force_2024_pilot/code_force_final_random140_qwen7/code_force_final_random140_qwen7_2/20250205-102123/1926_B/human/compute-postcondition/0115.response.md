Functionality: **The function processes multiple grids, each defined by an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) strings, where each string contains \( n \) characters ('0' or '1'). It identifies whether the grid contains a triangle or a square that includes all '1's and has a size greater than 1. If a triangle is found, it prints 'Triangle'; otherwise, it prints 'Square'. The function does not return any value but prints the identified shape for each grid.**
