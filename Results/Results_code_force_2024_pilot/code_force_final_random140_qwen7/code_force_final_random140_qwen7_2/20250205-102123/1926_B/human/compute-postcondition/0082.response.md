Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code `s = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `s`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new variable `s` which holds the input string from the user.
