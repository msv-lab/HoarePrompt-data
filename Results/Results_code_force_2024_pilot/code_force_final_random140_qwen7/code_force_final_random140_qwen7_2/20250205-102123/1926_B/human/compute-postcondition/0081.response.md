Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `j` and `n`. Therefore, we need to focus on adjusting the states of these variables.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j` and `n`**:
   - From the given information, `j` is initially set to `n + 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`). For the loop to start, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` is initialized as `n + 1`, it does not affect the loop's execution condition directly. However, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `total` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `i` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `a` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `b` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `j` is initialized as `n + 1`, but this does not affect the loop's execution condition.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution, but since the loop hasn't started yet, it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
