Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `a` is 'Triangle' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, and `b` is 'Square' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(n):`.

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute again if `j < n`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `j` and `n`, we need to update these variables.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

6. **Determine New Values:**
   - Let's assume `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, `j` should now be `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `k + 1`, and `n` remains unchanged (still greater than or equal to 1).

7. **Final States:**
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `s` remains the same input string.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same based on the count of '1' in `s`.

Given this reasoning, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input string, `a` is 'Triangle' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, and `b` is 'Square' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.**
