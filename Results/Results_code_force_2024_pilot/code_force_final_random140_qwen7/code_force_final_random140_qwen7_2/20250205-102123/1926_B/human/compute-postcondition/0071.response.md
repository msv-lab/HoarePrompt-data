Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, but the current value of `a` is not 0
- `b` is 'Square'
- `j` is equal to `n` + 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution

The print statement `print(a)` will print the value of `a`. Since it is explicitly stated that the current value of `a` is not 0, and the only other possible value for `a` is 'Triangle', the value of `a` must be 'Triangle'.

Output: **Triangle**
