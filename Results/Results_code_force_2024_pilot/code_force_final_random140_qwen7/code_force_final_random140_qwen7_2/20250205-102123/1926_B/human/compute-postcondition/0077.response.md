Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0.
   - `b` is 'Square'.
   - `j` is equal to `n` + 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2 (since `i` starts from 0).
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must remain greater than 0 (as it was at the end of the previous iteration).

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, `j`, `n`, and `s`) are not affected by the loop head and thus remain the same.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is equal to `n` + 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution.**
