Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is equal to `n` + 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 1, `a` will be either 'Triangle' or 0 depending on the input strings received, `b` remains 'Square', `j` is equal to the value of `n` plus one (since `j` starts at 2 and increments by 1 with each iteration), `n` must still be greater than 0, and `s` holds the last input string provided during the loop's execution.
