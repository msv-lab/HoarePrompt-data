Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, the input string `s` contains exactly one '1'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'Triangle'` to the variable `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
