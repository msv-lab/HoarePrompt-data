Output State: **`a` is 'Triangle', `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the string `s` contains exactly one '1'.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value `'Triangle'`. All other variables retain their initial states as specified in the precondition.
