Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed.
- `j` equals `n`.
- `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution.
- `a` is 'Triangle' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, and `b` is 'Square' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1.
- The value of `i` remains 2 as it was initialized and not changed within the loop.
- The condition `a != 0` is true.

Given these conditions, we need to determine the value of `a`.

Since `a` is set to 'Triangle' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, and `a` is not zero (`a != 0`), it implies that the count of '1' in `s` must be exactly 1.

Therefore, the value of `a` is 'Triangle'.

Output: **Triangle**
