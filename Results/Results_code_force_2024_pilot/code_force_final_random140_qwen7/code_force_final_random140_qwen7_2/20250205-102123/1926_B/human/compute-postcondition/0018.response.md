Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0
   - `b` is either 'Square' or an empty string
   - `j` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - The string `s` contains exactly one '1' if `a` is 'Triangle', otherwise the string `s` contains more than one '1'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 0 and `n` must be greater than 0, for the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains greater than 0 (no change needed).
   - `i` remains 0 (no change needed).
   - `a` remains either 'Triangle' or 0 (no change needed).
   - `b` remains either 'Square' or an empty string (no change needed).
   - `j` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0 (no change needed).
   - The condition for `s` based on `a` remains the same (no change needed).

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is either 'Square' or an empty string, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the string `s` contains exactly one '1' if `a` is 'Triangle', otherwise the string `s` contains more than one '1'.**
