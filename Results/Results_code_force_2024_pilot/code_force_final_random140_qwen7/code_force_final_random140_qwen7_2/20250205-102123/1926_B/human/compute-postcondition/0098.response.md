Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an updated input string, `a` is 'Square', `b` is 'Square', and `j` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.** 

This means that regardless of whether the condition `s.count('1') == 1` is true or false, the final state of the variables will be as described. If the condition is true, `a` will be set to 'Triangle', but since the else part sets `a` to 'Square', `a` will ultimately be 'Square'. Similarly, `b` will be set to 'Square' in the else part and will remain so.
