Postcondition: **t must be greater than 0, i is 0, a is either 'Triangle' or 0, b is 'Square', j is 2, n must be greater than 0, and if the current value of a is not 0, then a remains unchanged; otherwise, a is set to 'Triangle'. Additionally, s is the last input string received during the loop's execution.**
