Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initially set to 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for j in range(n)` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is already set to 2, it does not need adjustment.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution**.
