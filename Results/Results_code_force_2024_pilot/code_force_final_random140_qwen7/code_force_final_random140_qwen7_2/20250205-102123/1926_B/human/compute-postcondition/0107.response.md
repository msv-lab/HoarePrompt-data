Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed, `j` equals `n`, `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution, `a` is 'Triangle' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, and `b` is 'Square' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1. The value of `i` remains 2 as it was initialized and not changed within the loop. Additionally, the condition `a != 0` is true.**
