Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is equal to `n` + 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is reassigned to `0`, which overrides its previous value of either `'Triangle'` or `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
