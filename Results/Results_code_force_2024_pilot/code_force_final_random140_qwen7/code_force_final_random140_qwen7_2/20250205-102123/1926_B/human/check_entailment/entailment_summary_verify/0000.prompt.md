You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple grids, each defined by an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) strings, where each string contains \( n \) characters ('0' or '1'). It identifies whether the grid contains a triangle or a square that includes all '1's and has a size greater than 1. If a triangle is found, it prints 'Triangle'; otherwise, it prints 'Square'. The function does not return any value but prints the identified shape for each grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the following grid:
```
5

00000

00000

01110

01110

00000
```

This grid contains a triangle with `k=3`, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because it checks each row individually and finds only one row with a single '1'. The program does not check for the specific pattern required to form a triangle or a square across multiple rows.

To fix this, the program needs to check for the specific patterns of a triangle and a square across multiple rows, not just within individual rows.
