Reasoning:
1. The given program attempts to determine whether the grid represents a triangle or a square.
2. The logic in the program is flawed:
   - It initializes `a` and `b` before processing each test case.
   - It checks each row to see if it contains exactly one '1' and sets `a` to 'Triangle'.
   - If any row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'Square'.
   - However, this approach does not correctly identify the shape because:
     - A triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1'.
     - A square can have rows with exactly one '1' if it is positioned at the center.
3. The program does not properly check the structure of the grid to determine if it forms a triangle or a square.
4. Given the example inputs and outputs, the program would fail to correctly identify the shapes in many cases.

Correctness: **False**
