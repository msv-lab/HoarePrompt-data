You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0):
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each iteration, `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even. The values of `n` and `m` do not change regardless of the condition `n < m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple pairs of positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) provided through standard input. For each pair, it checks if \( n \) is less than \( m \). If \( n \) is less than \( m \), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if both \( n \) and \( m \) are either odd or even. If they are, it prints 'YES'. After processing all pairs, the function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each pair based on the specified conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.

2. **Condition Checks:**
   - The program checks if `n < m`. If this condition is true, it prints 'NO'. This part is correct because if `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves since each move can only add or remove one cube.

3. **Parity Check:**
   - The program then checks the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m`.
     - If both `n` and `m` are odd (`n & 1 and m & 1`), it prints 'YES'.
     - If both `n` and `m` are even (`n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0`), it also prints 'YES'.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Case 1: `n < m`**
  - This condition correctly identifies when it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the program's behavior here is correct.

- **Case 2: Parity Check**
  - The program checks if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even.
  - However, this check alone is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key point is whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even or odd.
  - Specifically, the difference `n - m` must be even because each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either adding or removing).

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: `3 3`**
   - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - Difference: `3 - 3 = 0` (even)
   - Output: `YES` (correct)

2. **Test Case: `2 4`**
   - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - Difference: `2 - 4 = -2` (even)
   - Output: `NO` (incorrect, should be `YES`)

3. **Test Case: `5 3`**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - Difference: `5 - 3 = 2` (even)
   - Output: `YES` (correct)

### Conclusion:

The program incorrectly handles cases where the difference between `n` and `m` is even but does not account for the actual possibility of achieving `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
