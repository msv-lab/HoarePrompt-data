Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.

2. **Condition Checks:**
   - The program checks if `n < m`. If this condition is true, it prints 'NO'. This part is correct because if `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves since each move can only add or remove one cube.

3. **Parity Check:**
   - The program then checks the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m`.
     - If both `n` and `m` are odd (`n & 1 and m & 1`), it prints 'YES'.
     - If both `n` and `m` are even (`n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0`), it also prints 'YES'.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Case 1: `n < m`**
  - This condition correctly identifies when it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the program's behavior here is correct.

- **Case 2: Parity Check**
  - The program checks if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even.
  - However, this check alone is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key point is whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even or odd.
  - Specifically, the difference `n - m` must be even because each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either adding or removing).

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: `3 3`**
   - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - Difference: `3 - 3 = 0` (even)
   - Output: `YES` (correct)

2. **Test Case: `2 4`**
   - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - Difference: `2 - 4 = -2` (even)
   - Output: `NO` (incorrect, should be `YES`)

3. **Test Case: `5 3`**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - Difference: `5 - 3 = 2` (even)
   - Output: `YES` (correct)

### Conclusion:

The program incorrectly handles cases where the difference between `n` and `m` is even but does not account for the actual possibility of achieving `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
