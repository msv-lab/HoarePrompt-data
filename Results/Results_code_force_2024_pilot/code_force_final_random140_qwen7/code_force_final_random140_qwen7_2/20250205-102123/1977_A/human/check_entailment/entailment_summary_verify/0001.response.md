### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the parity check and the difference between `n` and `m`. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the provided function summary and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move adds or removes exactly one cube.
- The difference between `n` and `m` must be even for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple pairs of integers \( n \) and \( m \).
- It checks if `n < m` and prints 'NO' if true.
- It checks the parity of `n` and `m` and prints 'YES' if both are odd or both are even.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - Correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - Reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.

2. **Condition Checks:**
   - **Condition 1:** `if n < m`: This condition correctly identifies when it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the program's behavior here is correct.

   - **Condition 2:** The parity check (`if n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0)`):
     - This check determines if both `n` and `m` are either odd or even.
     - However, this check alone is not sufficient. The critical factor is whether the difference `n - m` is even.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The difference `n - m` must be even for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - The parity check alone does not guarantee this. For example:
     - **Test Case: `2 4`**
       - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
       - Difference: `2 - 4 = -2` (even)
       - Both `n` and `m` are even, so the program prints 'YES', which is incorrect.
     - **Test Case: `5 3`**
       - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
       - Difference: `5 - 3 = 2` (even)
       - Both `n` and `m` are odd, so the program prints 'YES', which is correct.

To fix the program, we need to check if the difference `n - m` is even. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the difference `n - m` is even before printing 'YES'.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the corrected version of the function, the program now correctly checks if the difference `n - m` is even, ensuring the correct output for all test cases.

Final: **True**
