The function processes multiple pairs of positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) provided through standard input. For each pair, it checks if \( n \) is less than \( m \). If \( n \) is less than \( m \), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if both \( n \) and \( m \) are either odd or even. If they are, it prints 'YES'. After processing all pairs, the function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each pair based on the specified conditions.
