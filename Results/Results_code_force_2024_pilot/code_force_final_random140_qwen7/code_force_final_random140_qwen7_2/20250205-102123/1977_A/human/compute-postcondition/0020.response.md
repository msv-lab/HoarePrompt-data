Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer that is either odd or even, `m` is an integer that is either odd or even, and both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even after taking input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial conditions that both `n` and `m` must be either both odd or both even are preserved. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the input operation.
