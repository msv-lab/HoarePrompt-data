Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives two positive integers n and m within the range 1 to 100 through some external means (such as function calls or global variables), and returns a value based on the relationship between n and m.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes the values of `n` and `m` internally, although the problem statement does not specify the exact operation. The function verifies that both `n` and `m` are within the specified range (1 to 100) and then performs some operation on them, returning a result based on their relationship.
