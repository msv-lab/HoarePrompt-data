Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. However, since `_` is typically an unused variable, we don't need to concern ourselves with its value.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. This input will determine how many times the loop will run.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: The initial state is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will run `t` times, where `t` is the input from the user, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is a positive integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
