Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is the first integer input by the user.
   - `m` is the second integer input by the user.
   - The condition for continuing the loop is that both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for a number of iterations equal to the integer input by the user (`int(input())`).

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we need to focus on how the loop condition changes based on the inputs `n` and `m`.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (since the loop runs for this many iterations).
   - After each iteration, the values of `n` and `m` are checked to determine if they should continue or not.
   - If the condition is met (both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even), the loop continues.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variables that change within the loop head are `n` and `m`.
   - The loop will continue if the condition is met, meaning `n` and `m` must satisfy the condition of being either both odd or both even.

Given that the loop is controlled by the input integer and the condition on `n` and `m`, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `m`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer that is either odd or even, `m` is an integer that is either odd or even, and both `n` and `m` must be either both odd or both even.**

This ensures that the loop condition is met for the next iteration.
