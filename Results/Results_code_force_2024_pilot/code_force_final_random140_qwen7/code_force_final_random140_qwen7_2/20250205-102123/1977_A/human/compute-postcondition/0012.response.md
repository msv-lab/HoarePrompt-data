Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user**.

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
