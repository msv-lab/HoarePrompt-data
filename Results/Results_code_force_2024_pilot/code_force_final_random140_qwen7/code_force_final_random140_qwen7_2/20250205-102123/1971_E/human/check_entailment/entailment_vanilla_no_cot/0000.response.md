Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`. It then reads the positions `a` and times `b` for the known points.

2. **Calculating Speeds**: The program calculates the distances between consecutive points (`ad`) and the corresponding time differences (`bd`). From these, it computes the speeds (`v`) between consecutive points.

3. **Query Handling**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the queried point `ql` lies. If the queried point exactly matches one of the known points, it directly outputs the corresponding time. Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to travel from the previous known point to the queried point using the speed of that segment.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Given the structure and logic of the program, it should work correctly for the described problem, handling all the constraints and requirements appropriately.
