Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in calculating the time taken to reach point `d`. Specifically, the calculation of `m` in the loop where the program tries to interpolate the time based on the speeds between points does not correctly handle the case when the point `d` lies exactly between two known points.

Consider the following example:

- For a test case with `n = 10`, `k = 2`, and `q = 3`.
- Points `a` are `[0, 4, 10]`.
- Times `b` are `[0, 4, 10]`.

For the query `d = 2`, the program should calculate the time as follows:
- Between `0` and `4`, the speed is `1` unit per minute.
- Between `4` and `10`, the speed is `1.5` units per minute.

The correct time to reach `2` would be \(2 \text{ units} \times 1 \text{ unit/minute} = 2 \text{ minutes}\).

However, the program incorrectly calculates this time. It uses the speed between `0` and `4` to estimate the time, which results in an incorrect value.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly interpolate the speed and time between the known points. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
