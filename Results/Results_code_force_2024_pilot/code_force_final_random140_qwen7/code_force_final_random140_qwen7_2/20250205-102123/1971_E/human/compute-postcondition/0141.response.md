Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is 0, `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code subtracts the value of `a[s - 1]` from `ql`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `a[s - 1]`, `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`. The other variables (`i`, `l`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
