Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from user input; `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` that starts with 0 and is followed by integers obtained from user input. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated based on the user's input.
