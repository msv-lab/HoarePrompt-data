Output State: **`i` is `len(b) + 3`, `ad` includes `[a[len(b) + 3] - a[len(b) + 2], a[i] - a[i - 1]]`, and `len(a)` remains the same and must still be greater than `len(b) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is `len(b) + 3`, `a[i]` is `a[len(b) + 3]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[len(b) + 2]`. Therefore, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is added to `ad`. The length of `a` and its relationship to `len(b) + 1` remain unchanged.
