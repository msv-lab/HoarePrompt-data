Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `ad` now contains the elements `[ad[-1], a[current_i] - a[current_i - 1]]`
- `i` is `current_i`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is currently `current_i`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments by `1` each time, if `i` is currently `current_i`, the next value of `i` will be `current_i + 1`.

2. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(a)`.
   - Therefore, `current_i + 1` must be less than `len(a)`.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be updated to `current_i + 1`.
   - The state of `ad` does not change because it is not affected by the loop head variables.

### Final State:
- `i` will be `current_i + 1`.
- `ad` remains unchanged.

### Updated State:
State: **`ad` now contains the elements `[ad[-1], a[current_i] - a[current_i - 1]]`, `i` is `current_i + 1`**
