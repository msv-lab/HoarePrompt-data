Output State: **`bd` has a new element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `b` and `i` retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `bd`. This new element is the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]`. The values of `b` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
