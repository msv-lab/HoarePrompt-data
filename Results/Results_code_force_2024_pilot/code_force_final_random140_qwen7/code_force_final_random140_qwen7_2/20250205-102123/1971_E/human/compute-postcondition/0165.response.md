Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `bd` has a new element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.
   - `b` retains its previous value.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(1, len(b))`. This means `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2` (since it increments by 1 each time).
   - The value of `bd` and `b` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `bd` has a new element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.
- `b` retains its previous value.
- `i` is `i + 2`.

Putting this into the required format:

State: **`bd` has a new element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `b` retains its previous value, `i` is `i + 2`**
