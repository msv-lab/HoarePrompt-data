Output State: **`ad` now contains the elements `[ad[-1], a[current_i] - a[current_i - 1], a[i] - a[i - 1]]`, `i` is `current_i + 2`**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Initially, `ad` contained the elements `[ad[-1], a[current_i] - a[current_i - 1]]`. After appending `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `ad` now contains three elements. Also, since `i` was set to `current_i + 1` initially, incrementing `i` by 1 results in `i` being `current_i + 2`.
