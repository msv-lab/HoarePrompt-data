Output State: **`i` is 2, `len(b)` must be greater than 1, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`, and `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` has been executed with `i` being 2, so `bd` now contains `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1]]`.**

Explanation: The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 2, this translates to appending `b[2] - b[1]` to `bd`. Since `bd` initially contained only `[b[1] - b[0]]`, after executing the code, `bd` will contain `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1]]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
