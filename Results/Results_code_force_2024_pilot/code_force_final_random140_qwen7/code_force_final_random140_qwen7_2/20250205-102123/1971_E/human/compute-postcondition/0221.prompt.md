Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; t is assigned the value of int(input()).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
        print(m, end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `v` will contain `len(a) - 1` elements, each being the result of dividing the corresponding element in `ad` by the corresponding element in `bd`. The variable `i` will be set to `len(b) + 1` after the loop finishes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 4, l is 3, m is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) // ad[s]`, ql is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 1, `l` is `q-1`, `m` is the final accumulated value of `m` after all iterations of the loop.

Explanation: The loop runs `q` times as defined by the variable `q`. After all iterations, the value of `l` will be `q-1` because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. The variable `i` remains 1 throughout the loop as it is only initialized and not modified within the loop body. The variable `m` accumulates its value based on the operations performed inside the loop for each iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, `m` will hold the final computed value after processing all inputs up to `q-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
