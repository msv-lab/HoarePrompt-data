Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for the loop variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the problem, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). It is also given that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range and is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. This means ensuring that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0**.
