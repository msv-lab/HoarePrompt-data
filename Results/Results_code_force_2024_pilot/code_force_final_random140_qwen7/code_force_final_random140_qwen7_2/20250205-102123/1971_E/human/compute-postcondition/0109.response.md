Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer**

The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `ql`. The values of `i`, `l`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `q` must be greater than 0 is not directly checked or modified by the code, so it remains as a condition that needs to be satisfied.
