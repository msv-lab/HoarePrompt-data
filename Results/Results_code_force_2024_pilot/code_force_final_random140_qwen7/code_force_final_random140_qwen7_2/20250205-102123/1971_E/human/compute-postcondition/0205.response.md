Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `l` and `q`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `l` is less than `q`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `l` is 1
   - `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `l` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `q` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` remains 1 (unchanged)
- `l` is incremented to 2
- `m` remains the same (`b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`)

So, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`**
