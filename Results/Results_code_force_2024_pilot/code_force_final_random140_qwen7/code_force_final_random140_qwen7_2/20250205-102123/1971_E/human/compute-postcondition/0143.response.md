Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) // ad[s]`**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding the result of `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])` divided by `ad[s]` to its current value. Since the exact values of `bd[s]`, `ql`, `a[s - 1]`, and `ad[s]` are not specified, `m` is expressed in terms of these variables. The other variables (`i` and `l`) remain unchanged.
