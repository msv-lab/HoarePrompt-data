Output State: **`m` is `m + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]))`, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])` to its current value. The other variables (`q`, `i`, `len(b)`, `s`, and `ql`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
