Output State: **`m` is 0, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `ql` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `ql`. The values of `m`, `q`, `i`, and `len(b)` remain unchanged from their initial states.
