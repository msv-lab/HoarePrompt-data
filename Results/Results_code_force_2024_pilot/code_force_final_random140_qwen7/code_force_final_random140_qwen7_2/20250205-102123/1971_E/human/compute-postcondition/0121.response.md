Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is 0**

Explanation: The line `i = 1` simply reassigns the value of `i` to 1, which is its original value. The values of `l`, `m`, and `ql` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `i` and retains the original values of `l`, `m`, and `ql`.
