To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is 1.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(b[s], end=' ')`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`. This function returns the index where `ql` should be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted. Since the exact values of `a` and `ql` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`.

However, the print statement is `print(b[s], end=' ')`, which means it will print the element at index `s` of the list `b`.

Since we don't have the exact values of `a` and `ql`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `b` and the index `s`.

Output: **b[s]**
