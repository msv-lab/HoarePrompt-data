Output State: **`i` is 4, `l` is 3, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) // ad[s]`, `ql` is 0, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `q` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers entered by the user, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then prepends a 0 to the resulting list. This updates the value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
