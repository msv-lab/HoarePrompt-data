Output State: **`i` is 2; `bd` is a list with one element which is `b[1] - b[0]`**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i-1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the difference `b[1] - b[0]` is calculated and appended to `bd`. After this operation, `i` is incremented (though not explicitly shown in the code, the next time this line runs `i` would be 2), and `bd` now contains one element, which is the difference between the first two elements of list `b`.
