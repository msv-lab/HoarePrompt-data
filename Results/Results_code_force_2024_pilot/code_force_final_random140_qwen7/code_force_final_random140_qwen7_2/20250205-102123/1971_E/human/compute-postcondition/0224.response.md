Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \(n\), \(k\), and \(q\) along with two lists \(a\) and \(b\) of length \(k\). It then calculates the differences between consecutive elements in \(a\) and \(b\) and stores them in lists \(ad\) and \(bd\), respectively. Next, it computes a list \(v\) where each element is the ratio of corresponding elements in \(ad\) and \(bd\). Finally, for each query \(d_i\) (where \(0 \leq d_i \leq n\)), it finds the appropriate segment in \(a\) and calculates a value \(m\) based on the segments and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but modifies internal states such as lists \(v\), \(ad\), \(bd\), and the loop variables \(i\), \(l\), and \(m\).**
