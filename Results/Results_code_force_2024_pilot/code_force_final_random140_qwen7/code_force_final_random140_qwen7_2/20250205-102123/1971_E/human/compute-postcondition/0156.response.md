Output State: **`ad` now contains the elements `[ad[-1], a[current_i] - a[current_i - 1]]`, `i` is `current_i`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Since `i` is `current_i`, the value being appended is `a[current_i] - a[current_i - 1]`. This new value is added to the existing list `ad`, making the last element of `ad` the previously stored value (which is `ad[-1]`), followed by the newly calculated difference. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still `current_i`.
