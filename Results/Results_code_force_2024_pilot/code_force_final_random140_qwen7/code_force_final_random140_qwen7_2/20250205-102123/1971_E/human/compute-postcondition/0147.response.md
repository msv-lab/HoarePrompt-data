Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 4
- `l` is 3
- `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) // ad[s]`
- `ql` is 0

### Loop Statement
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is a common convention when the loop variable is not needed within the loop body. However, the loop itself does not directly modify any variables listed here. The loop simply iterates `t` times.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute `t` times regardless of the values of `i`, `l`, `m`, or `ql`.

3. **Adjusting States**: Since the loop does not depend on the values of `i`, `l`, `m`, or `ql` to determine whether it should execute, these values remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Conclusion
Since the loop does not modify or depend on the values of `i`, `l`, `m`, or `ql`, and the loop will execute `t` times regardless of these values, the states of these variables remain the same.

### Final State
State: **`i` is 4, `l` is 3, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) // ad[s]`, `ql` is 0**
