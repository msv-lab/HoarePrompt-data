Output State: **`v` now contains `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]` and `ad[i] / bd[i]`, `len(b)` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than `len(a)`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Initially, `v` contained the value `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]`. After appending, `v` now contains both `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]` and `ad[i] / bd[i]`. The conditions on `len(b)` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
