Output State: **`ad` now contains an additional element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `i` is `len(a)`, and `len(a)` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is equal to `len(a)`, the expression `a[i]` would refer to an index out of bounds if `a` were accessed directly (since list indices start at 0). However, since `i` is exactly `len(a)`, the expression `a[i - 1]` refers to the last element of `a`. Thus, `ad` gains a new element which is the difference between the last two elements of `a`. The value of `i` remains `len(a)`, and `len(a)` itself does not change.
