Output State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Since the initial values of `a` and `ad` are not specified, we only know that `ad` has been updated by adding a new element, which is the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]`.
