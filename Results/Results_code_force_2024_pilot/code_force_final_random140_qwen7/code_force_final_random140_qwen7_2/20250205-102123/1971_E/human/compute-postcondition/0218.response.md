Output State: `i` is 1, `l` is `q-1`, `m` is the final value of `m` after the loop has executed `q` times.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for each `l` in the range `q`), the variable `i` remains 1 because the loop does not change its value within the loop body. The variable `l` will be `q-1` because the loop starts at `0` and increments `l` in each iteration. The variable `m` will hold the accumulated value after all iterations, which is calculated as described in the provided states for the first three iterations but extended to `q` iterations.
