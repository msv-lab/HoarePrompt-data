Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; t is assigned the value of int(input()).**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, after executing the code, `t` will be set to the integer input provided by the user, which must still fall within the specified range. All other variables remain in their initial state as no operations were performed on them.
