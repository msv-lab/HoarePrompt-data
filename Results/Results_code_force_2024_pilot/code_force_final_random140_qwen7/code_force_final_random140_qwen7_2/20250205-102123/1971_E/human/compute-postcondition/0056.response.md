Postcondition: **`m` is 0, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer converted to an integer, `l` is 2, and the program continues the loop or iteration if `a[s] == ql`, otherwise no change in the variables.**
