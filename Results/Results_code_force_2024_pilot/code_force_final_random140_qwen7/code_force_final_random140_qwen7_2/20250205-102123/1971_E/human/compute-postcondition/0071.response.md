Output State: **`m` is `m + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the position where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the position where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, and `l` is 3, remains valid.
