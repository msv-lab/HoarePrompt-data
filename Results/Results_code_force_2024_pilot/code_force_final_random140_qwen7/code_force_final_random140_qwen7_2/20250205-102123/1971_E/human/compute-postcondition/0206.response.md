Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `m` is reassigned the value `0`. The values of `i` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. The expression for `m` initially given (`m is b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`) is no longer relevant since `m` is directly set to `0`.
