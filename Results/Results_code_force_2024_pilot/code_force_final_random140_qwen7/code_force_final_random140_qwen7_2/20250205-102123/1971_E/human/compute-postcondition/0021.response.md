Output State: **`i` is 4; `bd` is a list with four elements: `[b[1] - b[0], b[3] - b[2], b[4] - b[3], b[5] - b[4]]`**.

Explanation: The initial state has `i` as 4 and `bd` as a list with three elements `[b[1] - b[0], b[3] - b[2], b[4] - b[3]]`. The code appends `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Since `i` is 4, `b[i]` is `b[4]` and `b[i - 1]` is `b[3]`. Therefore, the new element appended to `bd` is `b[4] - b[3]`. Hence, `bd` now contains four elements: `[b[1] - b[0], b[3] - b[2], b[4] - b[3], b[5] - b[4]]`.
