Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `len(b) + 2`
   - `ad` is updated to include `[a[i] - a[i - 1]]`
   - `len(a)` remains the same and must still be greater than `len(b) + 1`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, len(a)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i < len(a)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1`, the current value of `i` (`len(b) + 2`) is greater than the starting point of the loop (1). Therefore, the loop will not execute in this case because `i` is already out of the range specified in the loop head.
   - However, if we assume the loop could potentially execute, `i` would be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **New State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(b) + 3`.
   - `ad` will be updated to include `[a[i] - a[i - 1]]`, but since `i` is now `len(b) + 3`, the update will be `[a[len(b) + 3] - a[len(b) + 2]]`.
   - `len(a)` remains the same and must still be greater than `len(b) + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `len(b) + 3`, `ad` is updated to include `[a[len(b) + 3] - a[len(b) + 2]]`, and `len(a)` remains the same and must still be greater than `len(b) + 1`**.
