Output State: `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting from the second element. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `bd`, `i`) remain unchanged.

In more detail, `ad` will contain `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`. The variable `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The lengths and contents of `a`, `b`, `bd`, and the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain as they were initially.
