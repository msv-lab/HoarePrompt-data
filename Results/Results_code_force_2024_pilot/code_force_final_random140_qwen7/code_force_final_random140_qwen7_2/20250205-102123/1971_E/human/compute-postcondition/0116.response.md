Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `m` is `b[s - 1]`, `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `m += b[s - 1]` increments the value of `m` by `b[s - 1]`. The other variables (`i`, `l`, and `ql`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
