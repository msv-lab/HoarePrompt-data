Output State: **`i` is `len(b) + 1`, `ad` is `[a[i] - a[i - 1]]`, `len(a)` must be greater than `len(b) + 1`**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are specific elements from the list `a`. Since `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `i - 1` would be `len(b)`. Therefore, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is calculated and appended to `ad`. The length condition of `a` being greater than `len(b) + 1` remains valid.
