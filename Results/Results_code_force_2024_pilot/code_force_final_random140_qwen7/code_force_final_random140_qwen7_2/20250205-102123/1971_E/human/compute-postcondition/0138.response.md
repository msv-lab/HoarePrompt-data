Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is 0, we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since there is no loop specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `l`, and `m`. It only indicates that the execution will continue with the next iteration of the loop, if any.
