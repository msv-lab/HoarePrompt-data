Output State: **`m` is 0, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer, and the current value of `a[s]` is equal to `ql`. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `a[s]` is equal to `ql` and the other conditions are still valid after executing the `continue` statement.
