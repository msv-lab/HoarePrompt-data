Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `l` is 0
- `m` is 0
- `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and the current value of `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.

The print statement is `print(b[s], end=' ')`.

To determine what will be printed, let's break it down:

1. `b[s]`: Since `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted and `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, it implies that `b[s]` must also be related to `ql` in some way. Given the context, it is reasonable to assume that `b[s]` is likely storing the same value as `ql` because `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.

Therefore, `b[s]` will print the value of `ql`.

Output: **ql**
