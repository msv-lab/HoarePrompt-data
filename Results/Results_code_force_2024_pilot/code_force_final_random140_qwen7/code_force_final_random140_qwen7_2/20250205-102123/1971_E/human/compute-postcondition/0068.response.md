Postcondition: **`m` is 0, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the position where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is 3, and the program continues the loop or iteration it was inside if `a[s] == ql`.**
