To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `l` is 1
   - `m` is 0
   - `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(b[s], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know the value of `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`. However, the values of `a` and `ql` are not provided. Since `bisect_left` returns the index where `ql` should be inserted to keep the list sorted, we need to consider the context of `a` and `ql`.

Given that no specific values for `a` and `ql` are provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe it in terms of the operation performed by `bisect_left`.

Since `b` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume `b` is a list and `s` is an index into this list.

Therefore, the print statement will output the element at index `s` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[bisect_left(a, ql)]**
