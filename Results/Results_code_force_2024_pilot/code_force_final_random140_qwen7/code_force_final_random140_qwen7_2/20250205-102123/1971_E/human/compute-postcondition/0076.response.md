Output State: **`v` contains `len(a) - 1` elements, each being the result of dividing the corresponding element in `ad` by the corresponding element in `bd`, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. However, the values of `v`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
