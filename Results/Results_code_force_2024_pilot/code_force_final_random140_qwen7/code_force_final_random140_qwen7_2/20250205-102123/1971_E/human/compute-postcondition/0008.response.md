Output State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Since the values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are not specified, we only know that `ad` now contains an additional element, which is the result of the subtraction. All other variables (`a`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
