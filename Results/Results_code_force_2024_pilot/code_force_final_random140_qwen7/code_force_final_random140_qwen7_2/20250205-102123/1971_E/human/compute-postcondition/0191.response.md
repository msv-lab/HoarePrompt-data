Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `l` is 0
- `m` is defined as `bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1]`

The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m`.

However, the values of `bd`, `ql`, `ad`, and `b` are not explicitly given. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `m`. We can only describe it in terms of the given formula.

Output: **bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1]**
