Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly initializes the grid, elements dictionary, allPlayers dictionary, goal list, and points list based on the input.
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the dimensions of the grid, populates the grid, and initializes the necessary data structures.

2. **Command Processing**:
   - The program processes each command correctly:
     - For commands involving catching or throwing the Quaffle, it updates the state of the players and the grid accordingly.
     - For movement commands, it updates the positions of the players and the Quaffle.
     - It correctly handles scoring when a player scores in the opponent's goal and prints the appropriate messages.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The scoring logic is implemented correctly. When a player scores in the opponent's goal, the corresponding team's score is incremented, and the appropriate message is printed.

4. **Final Score Output**:
   - The final score is correctly calculated and printed at the end of the game.

5. **Helper Functions**:
   - The helper functions `goalIn` and `isPlayer` are implemented correctly and are used appropriately in the main logic.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the required functionalities accurately.

Correctness: **True**
