Postcondition: `ind` is now `i`, `line[ind]` is the element at index `i` in `line`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, otherwise `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)` appended to its existing content, `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned to `(i, ind)`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1, and if `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, `goal[tmp]` will have the tuple `(i, ind)` added to it.
