Output State: **`line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is `ind + 2`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code sets the value of `tmp` based on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is `'B'` or `'1'`. Since the value of `line[ind][0]` is not specified, `tmp` is assigned either `0` or `1` depending on its value. The other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
