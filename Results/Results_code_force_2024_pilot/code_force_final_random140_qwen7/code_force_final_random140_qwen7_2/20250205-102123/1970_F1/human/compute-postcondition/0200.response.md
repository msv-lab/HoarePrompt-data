Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`, `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', else `team` is 0, `points[team]` is 10 more than its previous value**.

This means that the points for the team (either 0 or 1, depending on whether `obj[0]` is 'B' or not) have been incremented by 10. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
