Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, which starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the loop, which is an integer such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd.

3. **Check the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
   - Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 99 and is odd, it will always be a positive number, ensuring the loop can execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` is 0.
   - The value of `n` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop can execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
