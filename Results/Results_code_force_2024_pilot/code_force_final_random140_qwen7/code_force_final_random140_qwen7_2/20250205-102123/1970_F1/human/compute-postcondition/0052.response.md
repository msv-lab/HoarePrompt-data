Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as before the loop started, `elements[line[ind]]` is set for each non-'..' element, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `goal[tmp]` is updated if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `line` is the result of reading a line from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split into a list of strings, `grid` now contains the line that was just read.**

Explanation: The code `grid.append(line)` appends the current line (after processing) to the `grid` list. The other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by this operation.
