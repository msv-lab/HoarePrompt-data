Postcondition: `ind` is now either `i` or remains `n-1`, `line[ind]` is the element at the new index `ind` in `line`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, otherwise `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)` either appended to its existing content or added to it, and `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned to `(i, ind)`, and `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1.
