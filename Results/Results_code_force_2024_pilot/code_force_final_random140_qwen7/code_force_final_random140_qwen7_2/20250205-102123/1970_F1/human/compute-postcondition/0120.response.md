Output State: **`ind` is 0 if it was 1, otherwise it is 1; `line` is a string with at least one character; the character at index 0 of `line` is not ".."; `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to be `(i, ind)'; if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`; `tmp` is 0 if the character at index 0 of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise it is 1; `goal[tmp]` is appended with `(i, ind)`**.

This means that the value of `ind` remains unchanged (0 if it was 1, otherwise 1), `line` remains unchanged (a string with at least one character), the character at index 0 of `line` is not "..", `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to be `(i, ind)`, if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, and `tmp` remains as 0 if the character at index 0 of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise it is 1. Additionally, the tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to the list `goal[tmp]`.
