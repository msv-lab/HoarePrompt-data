Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 3, `obj` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`, `pos` is updated to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and if `obj` is a player, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True else the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj` is not a player, `player` is `obj`, and if `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is False and `points[team]` is increased by 1 where `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `team` is not -1.
