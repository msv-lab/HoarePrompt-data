You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. grid is a 2D list of strings representing the field, where each string contains M characters and there are N such strings. elements is a dictionary mapping entities on the field to their coordinates, allPlayers is a dictionary mapping players to whether they are carrying the Quaffle, goal is a list of two lists, each containing tuples representing the coordinates of the goals for the red and blue teams respectively, and points is a list of two integers representing the current scores of the red and blue teams.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())
    grid = []
    elements = {'.B': (0, 0)}
    allPlayers = {}
    goal = [[], []]
    points = [0, 0]
    for i in range(n):
        line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        
        grid.append(line)
        
        for ind in range(len(line)):
            if line[ind] != '..':
                elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
                if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                    allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
                elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                    tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                    goal[tmp].append((i, ind))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the grid will be fully populated with lines read from standard input, and the following conditions will be met:
    t = int(stdin.readline().strip())
    for time in range(t):
        comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        
        if len(comand) == 3:
            obj, com, el = comand
            if el == '.Q':
                allPlayers[obj] = True
            elif el == '.S':
                team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
                points[team] += 10
                print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
        else:
            obj, com = comand
            pos = elements[obj]
            nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
            if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
                ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
                player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
                print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
            elif com == 'T':
                allPlayers[obj] = False
                if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                    team = goalIn(pos)
                    print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                    points[team] += 1
            elif isPlayer(obj):
                elements[obj] = nxt
            if obj == '.B':
                elements[obj] = nxt
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be the total number of iterations, `time` will be equal to `t-1`, and `command` will be the last command read from stdin and stripped/split. If any command included `.Q`, `allPlayers[obj]` will be set to `True` for the corresponding object. If any command included `.S`, `team` will be 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0, and `points[team]` will be incremented by 10. For commands without `.Q` or `.S`, if `obj` is a player and `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` will be set to `False` and `points[team]` will be incremented by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1. The positions of all objects will be updated according to the movement commands.
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: points[0] points[1]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n and m (both integers with 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and are odd), grid (a 2D list of strings representing the field), elements (a dictionary mapping entities to their coordinates), allPlayers (a dictionary mapping players to whether they are carrying the Quaffle), goal (a list of two lists, each containing tuples representing the coordinates of the goals for the red and blue teams respectively), and points (a list of two integers representing the current scores of the red and blue teams). The function does not return anything explicitly.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
