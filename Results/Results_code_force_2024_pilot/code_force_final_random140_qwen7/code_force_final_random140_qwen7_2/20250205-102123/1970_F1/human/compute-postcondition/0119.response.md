Output State: **`ind` is 0 if it was 1, otherwise it is 1; `line` is a string with at least one character; the character at index 0 of `line` is not ".."; `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to be `(i, ind)`; if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`; `tmp` is 0 if the character at index 0 of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise it is 1.**
