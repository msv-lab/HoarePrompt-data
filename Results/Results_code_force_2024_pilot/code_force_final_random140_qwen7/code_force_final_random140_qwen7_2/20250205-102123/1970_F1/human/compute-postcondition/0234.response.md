Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `time` is 3.
   - `obj` is the second element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second element of the `command` list (same as `obj`).
   - `el` is the third element of the `command` list.
   - `comand` is equal to `command`.
   - `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Determine Values:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `team` depends on the first character of `obj`. Since `obj` is the second element of the `command` list, we need to know the value of `command[1]` to determine `team`.
   - `GoalName[team]`: This depends on the value of `team`. If `team` is 1, then `GoalName[1]` will be used; if `team` is 0, then `GoalName[0]` will be used.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string with the format `3 [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`, where `[GoalName[team]]` is either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]` depending on the value of `team`.

Given the above steps, the precise output will be:

Output: **3 [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where [team] is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else it is 0)**
