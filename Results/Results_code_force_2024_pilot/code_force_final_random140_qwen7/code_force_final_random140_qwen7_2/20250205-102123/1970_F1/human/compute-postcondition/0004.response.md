Output State: **`grid` is an empty list, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd, `elements` is a dictionary mapping entities on the field to their coordinates with the key '.B' mapped to the coordinates (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is now [[], []], and `points` is a list of two integers representing the current scores of the red and blue teams.**

The code `goal = [[], []]` assigns an empty list to the variable `goal`. This changes the value of `goal` from its previous state (which was a list of two lists, each containing tuples representing the coordinates of the goals for the red and blue teams) to two separate empty lists. All other variables remain unchanged.
