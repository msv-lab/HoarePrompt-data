Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is calculated as (`pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`), `elements[obj]` is now equal to `nxt`, `com` is not equal to 'T', and `obj` is not equal to '.', `isPlayer(obj)` is True, and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True or `elements['.B']` is equal to `nxt`.

This postcondition summarizes that after the execution of the if-else block, `t` remains an integer greater than 0, `time` is still 0, `command` remains as a list of strings obtained from the standard input, `obj` and `com` remain as specified, `pos` is updated to `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is recalculated based on the movement direction, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and the conditions related to player positions and elements are maintained as per the if condition.
