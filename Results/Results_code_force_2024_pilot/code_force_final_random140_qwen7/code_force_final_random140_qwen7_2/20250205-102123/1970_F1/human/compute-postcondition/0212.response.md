Output State: **`team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `obj` is the second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`**.

This means that the `team` variable now holds the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`, which was called with the current value of `pos`. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
