Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 3, `obj` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `allPlayers[obj]` is False, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, `points[team]` is increased by 1.**

The code `points[team] += 1` increments the value of `points[team]` by 1. Since the value of `team` is determined by the function `goalIn(pos)`, which is not specified further, we keep it as `team`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
