Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list and is equal to '.S', `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `team` based on whether the first character of the first element in the `command` list (`obj[0]`) is 'B'. If it is 'B', `team` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
