Output State: **`line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)`; `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1.**

This means that the value of `tmp` is determined based on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is `'B'`. If it is `'B'`, then `tmp` is set to `0`; otherwise, `tmp` is set to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
