Output State: **`line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` has two elements: the first being `(i, ind)` and the second also being `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The given code appends `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `tmp` is determined by the condition `line[ind][0]` being `'B'` or not, `tmp` remains the same as its previous value. Therefore, `goal[tmp]` now contains two elements, both being `(i, ind)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
