Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 3, `obj` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else `team` is 0.**

This means that the value of `team` is determined based on whether the first character of `obj` is 'B' or not. If it is 'B', then `team` is set to 1; otherwise, `team` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
