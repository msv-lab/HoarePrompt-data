Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 3, `obj` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else `team` is 0, points[team] is increased by 10**.

This means that the value of `points[team]` has been incremented by 10, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `team` (whether it is 0 or 1) depends on the first character of `obj`.
