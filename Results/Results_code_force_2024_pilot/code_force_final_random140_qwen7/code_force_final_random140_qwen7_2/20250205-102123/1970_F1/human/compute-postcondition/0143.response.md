Output State: **`t` must be an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings. This list is assigned to the variable `command`. The values of `t` and `time` remain unchanged from their initial states.
