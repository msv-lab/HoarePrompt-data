Output State: **`line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the first line read from standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `line = stdin.readline().strip().split()` reads a single line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and then splits the resulting string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `line`. No other variables are affected, so their initial states remain unchanged.
