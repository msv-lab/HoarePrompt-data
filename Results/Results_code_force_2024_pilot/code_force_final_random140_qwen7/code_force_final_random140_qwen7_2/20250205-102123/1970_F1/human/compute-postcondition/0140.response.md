Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, the grid will be fully populated with lines read from standard input, and the following conditions will be met:**

- The variable `i` will range from `0` to `n-1`, and for each `i`, `ind` will range from `0` to `len(grid[i])-1`.
- The dictionary `elements` will map each non-`'..'` character in the grid to its coordinates `(i, ind)`.
- If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, the key `line[ind]` will be added to the `allPlayers` dictionary with the value `False`.
- For each goal character `'G'` in the grid, the coordinate `(i, ind)` will be appended to either `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` depending on whether the character before `'G'` is `'B'` or not.
- The `goal` list will contain two lists, each potentially containing multiple coordinates representing the positions of the goal characters in the grid.
- The `points` list will remain `[0, 0]` as it is not modified by the loop.
