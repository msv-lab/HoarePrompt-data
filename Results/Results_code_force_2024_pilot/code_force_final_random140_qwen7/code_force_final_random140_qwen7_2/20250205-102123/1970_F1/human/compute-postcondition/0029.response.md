Output State: **`line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)`**

Explanation: The code simply sets `allPlayers[line[ind]]` to `False`. This does not affect any other variables or their relationships. The previous values of `line`, `ind`, `elements[line[ind]]`, `tmp`, and `goal[tmp]` remain unchanged. The only change is that `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is now `False`.
