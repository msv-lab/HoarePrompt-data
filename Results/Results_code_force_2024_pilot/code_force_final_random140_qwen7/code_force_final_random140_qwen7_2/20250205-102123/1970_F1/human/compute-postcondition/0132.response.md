Postcondition: `ind` is 2, `line` is a string with at least one character, the character at index 0 of `line` is not "..", `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`, if `line[2]` is not "..", `elements[line[2]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, 2)` if `line[ind][1]` is 'G'.
