Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be the total number of iterations, `time` will be equal to `t-1`, and `command` will be the last command read from stdin and stripped/split. If any command included `.Q`, `allPlayers[obj]` will be set to `True` for the corresponding object. If any command included `.S`, `team` will be 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0, and `points[team]` will be incremented by 10. For commands without `.Q` or `.S`, if `obj` is a player and `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` will be set to `False` and `points[team]` will be incremented by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1. The positions of all objects will be updated according to the movement commands.**

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `t` will reflect the total number of iterations, and `time` will be one less than `t`. The state of `command` will be the last command processed. Depending on the commands, `allPlayers`, `points`, and the positions of objects (`elements`) will be updated accordingly.
