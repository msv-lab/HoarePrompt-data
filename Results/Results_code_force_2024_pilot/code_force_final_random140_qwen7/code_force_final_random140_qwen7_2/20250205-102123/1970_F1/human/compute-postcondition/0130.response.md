Output State: **`ind` is 2, `line` is a string with at least one character, the character at index 0 of `line` is not "..", `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`, if `line[2]` is not "..", `elements[line[2]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `tmp` based on the first character of `line[ind]`. Since `ind` is 2, `line[ind]` is `line[2]`. The value of `tmp` is set to 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', otherwise it is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
