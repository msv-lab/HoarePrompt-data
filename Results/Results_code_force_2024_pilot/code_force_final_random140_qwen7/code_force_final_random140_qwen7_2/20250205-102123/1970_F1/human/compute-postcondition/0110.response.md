Postcondition: `ind` is 1, `line` is a string with at least one character, the character at index 0 of `line` is not '..', `elements` is updated such that the element at index `line[ind]` is assigned the value `i`, and the function `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`. Additionally, if the character at index `ind` of `line` is 'G', then `tmp` is set to 1 and `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`.
