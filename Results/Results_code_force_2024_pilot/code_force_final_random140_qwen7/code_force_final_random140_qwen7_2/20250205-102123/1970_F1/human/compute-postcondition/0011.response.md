Output State: **`line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is set by the loop, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`**.

This means that the value of `elements[line[ind]]` has been updated to a tuple containing `i` and `ind`. All other variables remain in their original state, including the condition that `line[ind]` is not `'..'`.
