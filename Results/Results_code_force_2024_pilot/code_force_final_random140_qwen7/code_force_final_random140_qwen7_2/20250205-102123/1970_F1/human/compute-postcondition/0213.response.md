Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`team`**: The value of `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`. Since `pos` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `team` without more context. However, we know it is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **`t`**: `t` is an integer greater than 0. We don't have a specific value for `t`, but we know it is a positive integer.

3. **`time`**: `time` is explicitly defined as 2.

4. **`obj`**: `obj` is the second element of the `command` list.

5. **`com`**: `com` is the second element of the `command` list, which means `com` and `obj` refer to the same value.

6. **`el`**: `el` is the third element of the `command` list.

7. **`comand`**: `comand` is equal to `command`.

8. **`pos`**: `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`. Since `elements` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `pos`.

9. **`nxt`**: `nxt` is calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. Here, `mov[com]` is a tuple representing movement in the x and y directions corresponding to the command `com`. Since `mov` and `com` are not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `nxt`.

10. **`allPlayers[obj]`**: `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.

Now, let's look at the print statement:

```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

- `time` is explicitly defined as 2.
- `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, but since `pos` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact team name from `GoalName[team]`.

Given the information, the print statement will output:

Output: **2 [team_name] GOAL** (where [team_name] is the result of `GoalName[team]` and `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`).
