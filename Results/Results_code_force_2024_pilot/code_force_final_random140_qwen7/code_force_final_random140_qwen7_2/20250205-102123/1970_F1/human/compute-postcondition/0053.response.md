Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `ind` and `len(line)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `ind` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `len(line)` is the length of the list `line`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `ind` is less than `len(line)`.
4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `ind` starts at `n-1`, we need to ensure that `n-1` is less than `len(line)` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - If `n-1` is not less than `len(line)`, the loop will not execute.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n`, `line`, and `ind`.

Here is the final state after adjustment:

State: **`ind` is `n-1`, `n` must be such that `n-1` is less than `len(line)`, `line` is the result of reading a line from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split into a list of strings**
