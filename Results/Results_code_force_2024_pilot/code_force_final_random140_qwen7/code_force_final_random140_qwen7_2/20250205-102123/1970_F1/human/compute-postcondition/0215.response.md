Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `obj` is the second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then `points[team]` is 1 more than its original value.**
