Postcondition: `ind` is 2, `line` is a string with at least one character, the character at index 0 of `line` is not "..". If `line[ind]` is not "..", `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, 2)`. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` is appended with `(i, 2)`.
