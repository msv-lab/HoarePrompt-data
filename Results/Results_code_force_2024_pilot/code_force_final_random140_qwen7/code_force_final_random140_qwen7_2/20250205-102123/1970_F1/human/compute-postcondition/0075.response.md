Output State: **`ind` is `n-2`; `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1.**

Explanation: The code checks if the first character of the string at index `ind` in the list `line` is 'B'. If it is, `tmp` is assigned the value 0; otherwise, `tmp` is assigned the value 1. The value of `ind` remains unchanged as it was initially `n-2`.
