Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list. If `len(command) == 3` and `el` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. If `el` is equal to '.S', then `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0, and `points[team]` is 10 more than its previous value. If `len(command) != 3`, then `obj` is not equal to '.', `isPlayer(obj)` is either `False` or `True`, `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is either `False` or `True`, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is calculated as (`pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`), `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1.
