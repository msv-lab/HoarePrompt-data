Output State: **`ind` is 2, `line` is a string with at least one character, the character at index 0 of `line` is not "..", `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`, if `line[2]` is not "..", `elements[line[2]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation:
- `ind` remains 2.
- `line` remains unchanged.
- `elements[line[ind]]` (which is `elements['2']`) is updated to be `(i, 2)`.
- If `line[2]` is not "..", `elements[line[2]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`. Since the exact value of `line[2]` is not specified, we keep it as a conditional statement.
- `tmp` is set to 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, which simplifies to `tmp` being 0 because `line[ind]` is `line[2]` and its first character is not specified but we know `tmp` is set based on whether it's 'B' or not.
- `goal[tmp]` (which is `goal[0]`) now contains the tuple `(i, ind)`, which is `(i, 2)`.
