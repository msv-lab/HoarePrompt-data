Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list of strings obtained by splitting the first line read from standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ind` is either 1 or remains 0, `line` is a string with at least one character, and the character at index 0 of `line` is not "..". Furthermore, if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then the function appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to `goal[tmp]` if the character at index 1 of `line[ind]` is 'G'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is 1 if it was 0, otherwise it is 0; `line` is a string with at least one character; the character at index 0 of `line` is not ".."; if `line[ind]` is not "..", `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to be `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `goal[tmp]` is appended with `(i, ind)` if the character at index 1 of `line[ind]` is 'G'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is 2, `line` is a string with at least one character, the character at index 0 of `line` is not "..", `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`, `elements[line[2]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)` if `line[2]` is not "..", `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, 2)`, and if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` is appended with `(i, 2)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
