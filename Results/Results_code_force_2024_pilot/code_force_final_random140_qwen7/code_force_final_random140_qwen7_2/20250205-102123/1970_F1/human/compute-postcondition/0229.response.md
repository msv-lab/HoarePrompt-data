Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first or second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`.**

Explanation: The line `comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()` reads a line from standard input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of strings, and assigns it to the variable `comand`. This does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `t`, `time`, `command`, `obj`, `com`, and `el` as described in the initial state.
