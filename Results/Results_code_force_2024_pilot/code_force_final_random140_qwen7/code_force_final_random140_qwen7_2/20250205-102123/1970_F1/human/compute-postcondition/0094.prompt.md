Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as before the loop started, `elements[line[ind]]` is set for each non-'..' element, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `goal[tmp]` is updated if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `line` is the result of reading a line from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split into a list of strings, `grid` now contains the line that was just read.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ind` is `n-1`, `n` must be such that `n-1` is less than `len(line)`, `line` is the result of reading a line from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split into a list of strings. After executing the if-else block, if `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, then `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the value `i` if `line[ind]` is a player and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, otherwise `elements[line[ind]]` is not assigned the value `i` and `ind` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `tmp` is 0 and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is `'..'`, then `ind` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is `n-2`; if `line[ind]` is not equal to `'..'`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, otherwise `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` includes a tuple `(i, ind)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is now either `i` or remains `n-1`, `line[ind]` is the element at the new index `ind` in `line`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, otherwise `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)` either appended to its existing content or added to it, and `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned to `(i, ind)`, and `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
