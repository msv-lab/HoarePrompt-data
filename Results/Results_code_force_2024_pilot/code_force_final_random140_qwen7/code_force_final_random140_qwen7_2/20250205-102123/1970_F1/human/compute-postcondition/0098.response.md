Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `ind` and the expression `len(line)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `ind` is the loop index, and it starts at 0.
   - `len(line)` is the length of the string `line`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `len(line)`. Therefore, `ind` must be initialized to 0 and `len(line)` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Consider the given state before the loop**: 
   - `grid` is a list containing one element, which is a list of strings obtained by splitting the first line read from standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - We need to focus on the loop head variables `ind` and `len(line)`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `ind` starts at 0, no adjustment is needed for `ind`.
   - For the loop to start, `len(line)` must be at least 1. This means the line read from standard input must contain at least one character.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`ind` is 0, `len(line)` must be at least 1**
