Output State: **`line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is set by the loop, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, and the function `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and the current value of `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' else 1, `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)`**

Explanation: The line of code `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `tmp` is determined by the condition `tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] is 'B' else 1`, and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', the value of `tmp` is 1 (because `line[ind][0]` is not 'B'). Therefore, the tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
