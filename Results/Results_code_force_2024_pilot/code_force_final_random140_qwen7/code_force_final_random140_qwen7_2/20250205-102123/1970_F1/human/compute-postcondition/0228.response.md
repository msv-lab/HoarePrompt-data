Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `time` and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `time < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `time` is either 1 or 2.
   - `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split.
   - `obj` is the first or second element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second or second element of the `command` list.
   - `el` is the third element of the `command` list.
   - `comand` is equal to `command`.
   - If `el` equals '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`.
   - If `el` equals '.S', `team` is determined as 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10.
   - If the `else` part is executed, `pos` is updated to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `nxt` is defined as `elements[obj]` (if the condition `obj == '.B'` is true, otherwise `nxt` remains undefined), `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and `points[team]` is 1 more than its original value if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1 and `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `time < t`, for the loop to execute one more time, `time` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `time` will be 3 (since it was either 1 or 2).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `time` becomes 3.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first or second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`. Additionally, if `el` equals '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` equals '.S', `team` is determined as 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If the `else` part is executed, `pos` is updated to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `nxt` is defined as `elements[obj]` (if the condition `obj == '.B'` is true, otherwise `nxt` remains undefined), `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and `points[team]` is 1 more than its original value if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1 and `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.**
