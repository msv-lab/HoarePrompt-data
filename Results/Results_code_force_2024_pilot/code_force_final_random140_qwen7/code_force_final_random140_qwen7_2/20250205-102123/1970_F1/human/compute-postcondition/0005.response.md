Output State: **`grid` is an empty list, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd, `elements` is a dictionary mapping entities on the field to their coordinates with the key '.B' mapped to the coordinates (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is now [[], []], `points` is [0, 0]**.

The code simply reassigns the value of `points` to `[0, 0]`. This does not affect the values of `grid`, `n`, `m`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, or `goal`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
