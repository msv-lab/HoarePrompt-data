Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `command` is a list of strings obtained from standard input, stripped and split.
   - `obj` is the first element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second element of the `command` list.
   - `el` is the third element of the `command` list and is equal to '.S'.
   - `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0.
   - `points[team]` is 10 more than its previous value.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - `time` is explicitly stated to be 0.
   - `GoalName[team]` depends on the value of `team`. Since `team` is either 0 or 1 based on the value of `obj[0]`, `GoalName[team]` will be `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]`.

Given this analysis, the print statement will output:
- The value of `time`, which is 0.
- The value of `GoalName[team]`, which could be either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]` depending on the value of `team`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **0 GoalName[team]**
