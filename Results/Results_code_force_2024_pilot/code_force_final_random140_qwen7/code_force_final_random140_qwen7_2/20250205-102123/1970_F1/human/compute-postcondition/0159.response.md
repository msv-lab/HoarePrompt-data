Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list. If `el` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. If `el` is equal to '.S', then `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0, and `points[team]` is 10 more than its previous value.
