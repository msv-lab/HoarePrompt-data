Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `ind` and `line`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each index `ind` in the range from 0 to `len(line) - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ind` is `n-2`.
   - If `line[ind]` is not equal to `'..'`, then:
     - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`.
     - Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1.
     - `goal[tmp]` includes a tuple `(i, ind)`.
   - `line` is the list being iterated over.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `ind` was `n-2` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `ind` will be incremented by 1, making it `n-1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `ind` should be less than `len(line)`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `ind` will be updated to `n-1`.
   - `line` remains unchanged.
   - The postconditions for the new value of `ind` need to be considered:
     - If `line[n-1]` is not equal to `'..'`, then:
       - If `isPlayer(line[n-1])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[n-1]]` is `False`.
       - Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[n-1][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1.
       - `goal[tmp]` includes a tuple `(i, n-1)`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ind` is `n-1`, `line` is the same list, if `line[n-1]` is not equal to `'..'`, then `allPlayers[line[n-1]]` is `False` if `isPlayer(line[n-1])` is true, otherwise `tmp` is 0 if `line[n-1][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` includes a tuple `(i, n-1)`**.
