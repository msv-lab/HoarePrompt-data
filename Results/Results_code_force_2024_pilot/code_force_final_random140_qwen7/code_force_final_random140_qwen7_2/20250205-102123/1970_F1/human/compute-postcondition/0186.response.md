Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is calculated as (`pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`), `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `com` is either 'T' or not 'T', `obj` is either not '.' or '.', `isPlayer(obj)` is either True or False, and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is either True or False, with the additional condition that if `com` is 'T', `points[team]` is 1 more than its previous value if `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`.
