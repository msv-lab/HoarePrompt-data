Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, which means it is a non-negative integer representing the team number.
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0, but its specific value is not relevant for the print statement.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `command` is a list of strings obtained from standard input, stripped and split.
   - `obj` is the first element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second element of the `command` list, and it is currently 'T'.
   - `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, meaning `pos` is a tuple representing the position on the grid.
   - `nxt` is calculated as (`pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`), where `mov` is a dictionary mapping commands to movement vectors.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, meaning the player with the `obj` identifier is not a player.
   - `com` is 'T', meaning the command is to move towards the goal.
   - `obj` is not equal to '.B', meaning the player is not the ball.
   - `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is `False`, meaning the next position is not occupied by another player.
   - `isPlayer(obj)` is `False` or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`, meaning either the current player is not a player or the ball is not at the next position.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))`.
   - Since `time` is 0, it will be printed as `0`.
   - `GoalName[team]` will be the name of the team corresponding to the `team` value.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output the time (which is 0) followed by the name of the team that reached the goal.

Output: **0 GoalName[team]**
