Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `time` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `obj` is the second element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second element of the `command` list (same as `obj`).
   - `el` is the third element of the `command` list.
   - `comand` is equal to `command` (a reference to the same list).
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`. Since `elements` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `pos`, but it is the position corresponding to the `obj`th element in the `elements` list.
   - `nxt` is calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. Here, `mov[com][0]` and `mov[com][1]` are movements in the x and y directions, respectively, based on the command `com`. Again, since `mov` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `nxt`, but it is the new position after moving from `pos` according to the movement rules specified by `mov[com]`.
   - `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True else the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. This means `player` is either the `obj`th element in the `command` list or the value at the grid position `nxt`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))`.
   - `time` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `player` is determined based on the conditions described above.

Given the explicit values and the conditions:
- `time` is 3.
- `player` could be either the `obj`th element in the `command` list or the value at the grid position `nxt`, depending on whether `isPlayer(obj)` is True or False.

Since we don't have the exact values for `obj`, `elements`, `mov`, `isPlayer`, and `grid`, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **3 [player] ELIMINATED (where player is either the [obj]th element in the `command` list or the value at the grid position `nxt`, depending on whether `isPlayer(obj)` is True or False)**
