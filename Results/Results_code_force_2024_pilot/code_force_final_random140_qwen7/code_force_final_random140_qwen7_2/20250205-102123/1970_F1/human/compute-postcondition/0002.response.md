The function `isPlayer` accepts a parameter `el`, which is a string representing an entity on the field. The string `el` has a specific format where the first character indicates the team ('R' for Red or 'B' for Blue) and the second character provides additional information (e.g., player number or 'G' for goal). The function returns a boolean value `res` which is True if the first character of `el` is 'B' and the second character is not 'G', and False otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `el`, returns `True` if the first character is 'B' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise it returns `False`.**
