Output State: **`team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `obj` is the second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `points[team]` is 1 more than its original value.**

Explanation: The code `points[team] += 1` increments the value of `points[team]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
