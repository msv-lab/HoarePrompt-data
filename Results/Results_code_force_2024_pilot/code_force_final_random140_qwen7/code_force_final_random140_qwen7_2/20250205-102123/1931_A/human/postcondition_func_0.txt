The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range of 3 to 78 inclusive. If `num` is between 1 and 26, it returns the corresponding lowercase letter from 'd' to 'z'. Otherwise, it does not return anything and simply ends. The final state of the program is that it either returns a character between 'd' and 'z' inclusive or it does nothing.
