Output State: **The program returns a character between 'd' and 'z' inclusive.**

Explanation: Given that `num` is an integer such that `3 ≤ num ≤ 26`, adding `96` to `num` results in a value between `99` and `122` inclusive. These values correspond to the ASCII codes for characters from `'c'` (99) to `'z'` (122). However, since `num` starts from `3`, the actual characters returned will start from `'d'` (100) to `'z'` (122).
