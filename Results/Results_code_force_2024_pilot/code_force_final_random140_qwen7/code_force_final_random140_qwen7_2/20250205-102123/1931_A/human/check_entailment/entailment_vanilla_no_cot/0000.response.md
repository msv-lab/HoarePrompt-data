Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for encoding three-letter words into a given integer `n`. Specifically, the logic for determining the characters `a`, `b`, and `c` is flawed and does not cover all possible scenarios, especially when the quotient of `n // 26` is greater than 2.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that we can decode any integer `n` within the specified range (3 to 78) back into the lexicographically smallest three-letter word. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = ''
    b = ''
    c = ''
    
    # Determine the character 'a'
    if n >= 27:
        a = chr(96 + (n - 26) % 26)
        n -= (n - 26) % 26 + 1
    else:
        a = chr(96 + 1)
        n -= 1
    
    # Determine the character 'b'
    if n >= 26:
        b = chr(96 + (n - 26) % 26)
        n -= (n - 26) % 26 + 1
    else:
        b = chr(96 + 1)
    
    # Determine the character 'c'
    c = chr(96 + (n % 26))
    
    print(a + b + c)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Determine Character 'a':**
   - If `n` is at least 27, then the first character `a` can be determined by taking the remainder of `(n - 26)` divided by 26.
   - Subtract the value of `a` from `n` to adjust `n`.

2. **Determine Character 'b':**
   - Similarly, if the adjusted `n` is still at least 26, then the second character `b` can be determined by taking the remainder of `(n - 26)` divided by 26.
   - Subtract the value of `b` from `n` to adjust `n`.

3. **Determine Character 'c':**
   - The third character `c` is simply the remainder of `n` divided by 26.

This approach ensures that we correctly decode the integer `n` into the lexicographically smallest three-letter word.
