Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   
2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `n` back into a three-letter word.
   - It uses the formula `n // 26` to determine the position of the first letter.
   - However, the logic for determining the letters `a`, `b`, and `c` is flawed.

3. **Flawed Logic**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the first letter can only be 'a' (position 1) and tries to fit the remaining sum into the second and third letters.
   - This approach does not account for all possible combinations and does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For `n = 24`, the correct answer should be "aba" (1 + 1 + 22), but the program outputs "aav".
   - For `n = 70`, the correct answer should be "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26), but the program outputs "rzz".
   - For `n = 3`, the correct answer should be "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1), but the program outputs "aaa".
   - For `n = 55`, the correct answer should be "czz" (3 + 26 + 26), but the program outputs "czz".
   - For `n = 48`, the correct answer should be "auz" (1 + 21 + 26), but the program outputs "auz".

### Correct Approach

To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to:
1. Determine the position of the first letter.
2. Distribute the remaining sum among the second and third letters while ensuring the smallest possible values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = ''
    b = ''
    c = ''
    
    # Determine the position of the first letter
    if n >= 52:
        a = chr(96 + (n - 52))
        n -= 52
    elif n >= 26:
        a = chr(96 + 1)
        n -= 26
    else:
        a = chr(96 + 1)
        n -= 1
    
    # Determine the position of the second and third letters
    if n > 0:
        b = chr(96 + 1)
        c = chr(96 + n)
    else:
        b = chr(96 + 1)
        c = chr(96 + 1)
    
    print(a + b + c)
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases and does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
