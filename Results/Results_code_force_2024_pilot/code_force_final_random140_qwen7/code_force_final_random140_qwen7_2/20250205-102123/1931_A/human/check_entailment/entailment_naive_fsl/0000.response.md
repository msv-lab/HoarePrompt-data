Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values. 

For example, consider the encoded value `3`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is `"aaa"`, which sums up to `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`. However, the program generates `"aaa"` only when `n // 26 == 0`, which is not the only condition for `n = 3`.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:
- When `n = 3`:
  - The program checks `n // 26 == 0` and sets `a = 'a'`, `b = 'a'`, and `c = 'a'`, which is correct.
  - However, it does not handle other valid combinations like `a = 'a'`, `b = 'a'`, and `c = 'a'` directly.

To fix this, the program needs to handle all possible cases where the sum of the indices of the three letters equals the given encoded value. A more robust approach would involve iterating through all possible combinations of three letters to find the lexicographically smallest one that matches the encoded value.
