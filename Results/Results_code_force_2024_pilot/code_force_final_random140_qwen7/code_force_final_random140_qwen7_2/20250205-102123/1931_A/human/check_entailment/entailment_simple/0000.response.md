### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that can be encoded to a given integer `n`.
   - The encoding is done by summing the positions of the letters in the alphabet (where 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the encoded value.
   - It then calculates the lexicographically smallest word that can produce the encoded value `n`.

3. **Breaking Down the Logic:**
   - The code uses a series of `if-elif-else` statements to determine the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the value of `n`:
     - If `n // 26 == 0`, it means the first letter is 'a', and the remaining sum is used for the second and third letters.
     - If `n // 26 == 1`, it means the first letter is 'a' and the second letter is the remainder when `n` is divided by 26.
     - If `n // 26 == 2`, it means the first two letters are 'a' and 'z', and the third letter is 'z'.

4. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - The logic correctly handles the different ranges of `n` and assigns the appropriate letters to `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - The use of `chr(96 + x)` ensures that the letters are correctly mapped to their positions in the alphabet.
   - The conditions and calculations ensure that the resulting word is the lexicographically smallest possible.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles all valid inputs within the specified range (3 ≤ num ≤ 78).
   - It correctly identifies the smallest possible word for each encoded value.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that can be encoded to a given integer `n`.

### Correctness:
**True**
