Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `n` back into a three-letter word by considering different ranges for `n // 26`.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** If `n // 26 == 0`, it means the word consists of letters that are all within the first 26 letters of the alphabet. The program sets `a` and `b` to 'a' and calculates `c` as `chr(96 + (n - 2))`.
   - **Case 2:** If `n // 26 == 1`, it means the word consists of two 'a's and one letter from the 27th to the 52nd position. The program sets `a` and `b` to 'a' and `c` to `chr(96 + 26)`.
   - **Case 3:** If `n // 26 == 2`, it means the word consists of one letter from the 53rd to the 78th position and two 'z's. The program sets `a` to `chr(96 + (n - 52))` and `b` and `c` to 'z'.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the decoded word for each test case.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples to ensure it works as expected:

- **Test Case 1: \( n = 24 \)**
  - \( 24 \div 26 = 0 \) remainder \( 24 \)
  - \( a = 'a' \), \( b = 'a' \), \( c = 'v' \)
  - Output: `aav`
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 2: \( n = 70 \)**
  - \( 70 \div 26 = 2 \) remainder \( 28 \)
  - \( a = 'r' \), \( b = 'z' \), \( c = 'z' \)
  - Output: `rzz`
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 3: \( n = 3 \)**
  - \( 3 \div 26 = 0 \) remainder \( 3 \)
  - \( a = 'a' \), \( b = 'a' \), \( c = 'a' \)
  - Output: `aaa`
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 4: \( n = 55 \)**
  - \( 55 \div 26 = 2 \) remainder \( 3 \)
  - \( a = 'c' \), \( b = 'z' \), \( c = 'z' \)
  - Output: `czz`
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 5: \( n = 48 \)**
  - \( 48 \div 26 = 1 \) remainder \( 22 \)
  - \( a = 'a' \), \( b = 'a' \), \( c = 'u' \)
  - Output: `auz`
  - Correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all test cases and produces the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded integer `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
