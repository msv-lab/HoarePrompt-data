### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the example input to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - `t` is read from the first line of input, representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is read, representing the length of the array `a`.
   - `q` is read, representing the number of queries.
   - The array `a` is initialized with a dummy value `0`.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - A loop iterates over the elements of the array `a` (excluding the dummy value).
   - For each element `x`, the variable `p` is updated to the current element.
   - The variable `j` is updated to the current index `i` if the current element `x` is not equal to `p`. Otherwise, `j` remains the same.
   - The array `a` is extended with the value of `j` at each step.
   - The index `i` is incremented after processing each element.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, `l` and `r` are read.
   - The program prints the result based on the value of `a[r]`:
     - If `a[r]` is less than `l`, it prints `[-1] * 2` (i.e., `-1 -1`).
     - Otherwise, it prints `(a[r], r)`.

#### Example Walkthrough:

Given the example input:
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`
   - `a = [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
   - `q = 3`
   - Queries: `(1, 5)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 3)`

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - `a` is processed as follows:
     - `x = 1`, `p = 1`, `j = 0`, `a = [0, 1]`
     - `x = 1`, `p = 1`, `j = 0`, `a = [0, 1, 1]`
     - `x = 2`, `p = 2`, `j = 2`, `a = [0, 1, 1, 2]`
     - `x = 1`, `p = 1`, `j = 2`, `a = [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]`
     - `x = 1`, `p = 1`, `j = 2`, `a = [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - Query 1: `l = 1`, `r = 5`
     - `a[5] = 1`, which is less than `l = 1`, so print `[-1] * 2` → `-1 -1`
   - Query 2: `l = 1`, `r = 2`
     - `a[2] = 1`, which is less than `l = 1`, so print `[-1] * 2` → `-1 -1`
   - Query 3: `l = 1`, `r = 3`
     - `a[3] = 2`, which is greater than `l = 1`, so print `(a[3], 3)` → `2 3`

The expected output is:
```
-1 -1
-1 -1
2 3
```

However, the actual output is:
```
-1 -1
-1 -1
2 3
```

The program correctly identifies that there are no valid pairs for the first two queries, but it incorrectly prints `2 3` for the third query instead of `1 3`.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to correctly identify the first valid pair of indices within the specified range `[l, r]` for each query. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
