Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the function `func()` is flawed and does not address the requirements of finding a pair of different elements within the queried range `[l, r]`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Initialization and Array Construction**:
   - The array `a` is initialized incorrectly. It starts with `[0]`, which is unnecessary and can lead to confusion.
   - The logic to construct the array `a` based on the condition `x != p` is incorrect. This logic seems to be intended to track the most recent index of a different element but does not correctly handle the problem requirements.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - The query processing part of the function simply prints the value at index `r` if it is greater than or equal to `l`. This does not ensure that the printed indices are within the range `[l, r]` and do not violate the condition `a[i] != a[j]`.
   - The logic to handle the case where no such pair exists (`a[r] < l`) is also incorrect. It should check if there are any distinct elements within the range `[l, r]` rather than just comparing `a[r]` with `l`.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not guarantee that the output format matches the required format, where it should print two distinct indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
