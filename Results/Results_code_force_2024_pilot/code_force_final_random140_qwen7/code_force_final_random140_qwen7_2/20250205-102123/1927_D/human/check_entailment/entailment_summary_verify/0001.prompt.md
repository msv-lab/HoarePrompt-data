You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Program:
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        R()
        a = [0]
        p = i = j = 0
        for x in R():

            i += 1
        (q,) = R()
        while q:
            q -= 1
            (l, r) = R()
            print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `a` of integers and handles a series of queries. Each query consists of two indices `l` and `r`. The function then prints the value at index `r` in the array `a` if it is greater than or equal to `l`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function continues processing until all test cases and queries are handled.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `R = lambda : map(int, input().split())`: Defines a function `R` to read multiple integers from a single line.
   - `(t,) = R()`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - The loop `while t:` processes each test case.
     - `t -= 1`: Decrements the number of remaining test cases.
     - `R()`: Reads the size of the array `n`.
     - `a = [0]`: Initializes an array `a` with a dummy value `0`.
     - `p = i = j = 0`: Initializes variables `p`, `i`, and `j` to `0`.
     - `for x in R()`: Reads the array elements.
       - `j = (j, i)[x != p]`: Updates `j` to `i` if the current element `x` is different from `p`.
       - `a += (j,)`: Appends the current value of `j` to the array `a`.
       - `p = x`: Updates `p` to the current element `x`.
       - `i += 1`: Increments the index `i`.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - `(q,) = R()`: Reads the number of queries.
   - The loop `while q:` processes each query.
     - `q -= 1`: Decrements the number of remaining queries.
     - `(l, r) = R()`: Reads the query bounds `l` and `r`.
     - `print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])`: Prints the result.
       - `a[r] < l`: Checks if the element at index `r` is less than `l`.
         - If true, prints `[-1, -1]`.
         - Otherwise, prints `(a[r], r)`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Array Construction:**
   - The array `a` is constructed such that `a[i]` stores the last index where the value `a[i]` appeared before index `i`. This is done using the variable `j` which is updated whenever a new value is encountered.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the element at index `r` is within the range `[l, r]`.
   - If `a[r] < l`, it means no distinct elements exist in the range `[l, r]`, so it prints `[-1, -1]`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the index `r` and the element `a[r]`.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Array: `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
  - Queries: 
    - Query 1: `1 5` → `a[5] = 1` (not in range `[1, 5]`) → Output: `-1 -1`
    - Query 2: `1 2` → `a[2] = 1` (in range `[1, 2]`) → Output: `2 3`
    - Query 3: `1 3` → `a[3] = 2` (in range `[1, 3]`) → Output: `1 3`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Array: `[30, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20]`
  - Queries: 
    - Query 1: `1 2` → `a[2] = 1` (in range `[1, 2]`) → Output: `2 1`
    - Query 2: `2 3` → `a[3] = 2` (in range `[2, 3]`) → Output: `2 3`
    - Query 3: `2 4` → `a[4] = 3` (in range `[2, 4]`) → Output: `4 2`
    - Query 4: `2 6` → `a[6] = 4` (in range `[2, 6]`) → Output: `4 6`
    - Query 5: `3 5` → `a[5] = 5` (in range `[3, 5]`) → Output: `5 3`

### Conclusion

The program correctly constructs the array `a` and processes each query to find a pair of different elements within the specified range or reports that no such pair exists. Therefore, the program is correct.
