Output State: **`x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is `x`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`, `a` is `a + j`**

Explanation: The code snippet `a += j,` increments the value of `a` by `j`. The values of `x`, `p`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `x` remains the next element in `R()`, `p` remains `x`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`, and `a` is updated to `a + j`.
