Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in R()`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `R()`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is assigned the tuple `(j, i)` where the first element is `j` and the second element is `i` only if `x` is not equal to `p`.
   - `a` is a tuple containing the tuple `(j, i)`.
   - `p` is now equal to `x`.
   - `i` is increased by 1.
   - The values of `R()`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more elements in `R()` to iterate over. Since `R()`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged from the previous iteration, the only thing that changes is the value of `x` (which is set to the next element in `R()`).

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is set to the next element in `R()`, `x` will be the next value in the sequence generated by `R()`.
   - `p` will be updated to this new value of `x`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `x` will be the next element in `R()`.
   - `p` will be the next element in `R()`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the previous state:
- `j` is assigned the tuple `(j, i)` where the first element is `j` and the second element is `i` only if `x` is not equal to `p`.
- `a` is a tuple containing the tuple `(j, i)`.
- `p` is now equal to `x`.
- `i` is increased by 1.
- The values of `R()`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged.

The new state for the next iteration will be:
- `x` will be the next element in `R()`.
- `p` will be the next element in `R()`.
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`j` is assigned the tuple `(j, i)` where the first element is `j` and the second element is `i` only if `x` is not equal to `p`; `a` is a tuple containing the tuple `(j, i)`, `p` is now equal to the next element in `R()`, `i` is increased by 1, the values of `R()`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged.**

However, since we need to focus on the loop head variables `x` and `R()`, the relevant part of the state update is:
State: **`x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is the next element in `R()`**.

So, the final state is:
State: **`x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is the next element in `R()`**.
