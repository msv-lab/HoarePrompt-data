Output State: **`q` is `q - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element is either `j` or `i` based on the condition that `x` is not equal to `p` during each iteration; `p` is the last value of `x` processed; `i` is the number of iterations performed; `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration; `t` remains as the initial positive integer - 1; `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `l` and `r` are the values returned by the function `R()`.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` calls the function `R()` and assigns its return values to `l` and `r`. No other variables are affected, so the values of `q`, `a`, `p`, `i`, `j`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The function `R()` returns two values, which are assigned to `l` and `r`.
