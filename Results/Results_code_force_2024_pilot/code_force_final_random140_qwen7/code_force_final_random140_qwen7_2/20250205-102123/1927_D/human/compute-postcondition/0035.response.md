Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `q` is a positive integer - 1. Since `q` is a positive integer minus 1, it must be 0 (the smallest positive integer minus 1).
   - `l` is the result of `R()`. We don't know the exact value of `R()`, so let's denote it as `l = R()`.
   - `r` is the result of `R()`. Again, we don't know the exact value of `R()`, so let's denote it as `r = R()`.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - `a[r]`: This refers to an element in a list `a` at index `r`. Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[r]`. Let's denote `a[r]` as `val_r`.
   - The expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` uses a conditional expression to choose between two tuples:
     - If `a[r] < l` is true, it chooses the tuple `(a[r], r)`.
     - Otherwise, it chooses the tuple `[-1] * 2`, which is a list with two `-1`s.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])` will print the chosen tuple.
   - If `a[r] < l` is true, it will print `(a[r], r)`, which is `(val_r, r)`.
   - If `a[r] >= l`, it will print `[-1] * 2`, which is `[-1, -1]`.

Given the initial state and the lack of explicit definitions for `a` and `R()`, we can only describe the output in terms of the conditions and values involved.

Output: **(val_r, r) if val_r < l, otherwise [-1, -1]**
