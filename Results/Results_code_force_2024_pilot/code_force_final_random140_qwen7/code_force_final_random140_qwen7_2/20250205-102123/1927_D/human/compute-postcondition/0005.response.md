Output State: **`t` is a positive integer - 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), the array `a` is now `[0]`, and `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\)**.

Explanation: The code `a = [0]` changes the array `a` to contain only one element, which is `0`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
