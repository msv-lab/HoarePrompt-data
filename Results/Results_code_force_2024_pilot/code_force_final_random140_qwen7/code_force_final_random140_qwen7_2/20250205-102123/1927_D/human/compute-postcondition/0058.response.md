Output State: **`j` is assigned based on the condition `(j, i)[x != p]` for each iteration, `a` is a list containing tuples of `(j, i)` for each iteration, `p` is the value of `x` from the last iteration, `i` is the total number of iterations, `j` is updated accordingly for each iteration, `x` and `p` are updated with each iteration, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` remains unchanged.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `j` will be assigned the value of either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`.
- `a` will be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the current values of `j` and `i` for each iteration.
- `p` will hold the value of `x` from the last iteration.
- `i` will be the total number of iterations executed.
- `x` and `p` will be updated with each iteration of the loop.
- `t` will be decremented by 1.
- `n` will remain as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
