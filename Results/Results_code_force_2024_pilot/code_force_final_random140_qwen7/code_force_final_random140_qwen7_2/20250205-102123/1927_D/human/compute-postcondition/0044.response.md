Output State: **`j` is assigned the tuple `(j, i)` where the first element is `j` and the second element is `i`, but only if `x` is not equal to `p`. The values of `R()`, `i`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged from the initial state.**

This means that the value of `j` is set to a tuple containing `j` and `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`. Otherwise, the value of `j` remains unchanged. The values of `R()`, `i`, `x`, and `p` are not affected by this assignment.
