Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is assigned the value of `q - 1`. This means `q` is decremented by 1.
   - `l` is the return value of `R()`. Since the function `R()` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact return value. Let's denote it as `l = R()`.
   - `r` is the return value of `R()`. Again, since `R()` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact return value. Let's denote it as `r = R()`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

   - The expression inside the `print` function is a tuple: `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)`.
   - We need to evaluate the condition `a[r] < l` to decide which part of the tuple to use.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, then the expression evaluates to `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, then the expression evaluates to `[-1] * 2`, which is a list with two `-1`s.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `a` is not defined, so we cannot determine its exact form or contents. For the sake of this problem, let's assume `a` is a list and `a[r]` refers to an element in this list.
- `l` and `r` are both the return values of `R()`, but their exact values are unknown.

Since we cannot determine the exact values of `a[r]` and `l`, we need to consider the condition `a[r] < l` in a general sense. Without knowing the exact values, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the condition.

If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the output will be:
- `a[r]` followed by `r`.

If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the output will be:
- `-1` followed by `-1`.

Since the exact values of `a[r]` and `l` are unknown, we can't provide a specific numerical output. Therefore, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **either (a[r], r) or (-1, -1) depending on the value of a[r] compared to l**
