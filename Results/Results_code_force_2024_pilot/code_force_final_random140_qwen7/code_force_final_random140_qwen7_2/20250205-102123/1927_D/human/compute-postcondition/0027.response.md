Based on the initial state provided:

- `q` is `q - 1`: This means `q` is decremented by 1 from its initial value.
- `a` is a list of integers where each element is either `j` or `i` based on the condition that `x` is not equal to `p` during each iteration. Here, `p` is the last value of `x` processed, `i` is the number of iterations performed, and `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration.
- `p`, `i`, `j`, `t`, `n`, `l`, and `r` have specific roles but their exact values are not provided in the initial state. We know `t` remains as the initial positive integer -1, `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and `l` and `r` are the values returned by the function `R()`.

Given the `print` statement:

```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

Let's break it down:

1. `a[r]` refers to the element at index `r` in the list `a`.
2. `[-1] * 2` creates a list with two `-1`s.
3. The expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` checks if `a[r]` is less than `l`. If true, it returns the tuple `(a[r], r)`, otherwise, it returns the list `[-1, -1]`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `r`, and `l` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact output. However, we can describe the possible outputs based on the conditions:

- If `a[r] < l`, the output will be `(a[r], r)`.
- If `a[r] >= l`, the output will be `[-1, -1]`.

Therefore, the output depends on the values of `a[r]` and `l`.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l, otherwise [-1, -1]**
