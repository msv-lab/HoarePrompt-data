Output State: **`t` is a positive integer - 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), the array `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \([1, 10^6]\), and `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\)**.

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making it a positive integer - 1. The values of `n`, the array `a`, and `q` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
