Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers where each element is either `j` or `i` based on the condition that `x` is not equal to `p` during each iteration; `p` is the last value of `x` processed; `i` is equal to the number of iterations performed; `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration; `t` remains as the initial positive integer - 1; `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `q` is the value returned by the function `R()`, `x` is the last value generated by the function `R()` during the loop's final iteration.
Code of the loop:
while q:
    q -= 1
    l, r = R()
    print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is `q - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element is either `j` or `i` based on the condition that `x` is not equal to `p` during each iteration; `p` is the last value of `x` processed; `i` is the number of iterations performed; `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration; `t` remains as the initial positive integer - 1; `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `l` and `r` are the values returned by the function `R()`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `q` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R().
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `q` is a positive integer - 1; `l` is the result of R(); `r` is the result of R()


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
