Output State: **`q` is greater than 0 and equal to its initial value minus 1; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R()**.

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` calls the function `R()` which returns two values. These values are assigned to `l` and `r`. The initial state of `q` being greater than 0 and equal to its initial value minus 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated variables `l` and `r` along with the unchanged condition of `q`.
