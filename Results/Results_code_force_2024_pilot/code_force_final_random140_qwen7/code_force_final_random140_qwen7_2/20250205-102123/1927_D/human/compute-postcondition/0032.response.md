The loop condition is `q`. According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `q` is non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must still be a positive integer.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `q` remains a positive integer. Since `q` was originally a positive integer and was decremented by 1, it must have been at least 2 initially to ensure it can become positive again. However, we only need to ensure it is non-zero for the next iteration.

State: **`q` is a positive integer**, `l` is a value returned by R(), `r` is a value returned by R().
