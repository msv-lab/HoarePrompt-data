Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether the next `x` is not equal to `p`, `p` is now equal to `x`, `i` is increased by 1, and `x` is the new value of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `p = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `p`. This does not change the values of `a`, `j`, `i`, or the condition that determines the value of `j`. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with the additional information that `p` is now equal to the current value of `x`.
