Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is `x`; variable `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The values of `a`, `x`, `p`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `a` is still increased by `j`, `x` is still the next element in `R()`, and `p` is still `x`. Additionally, `i` is now increased by 1.
