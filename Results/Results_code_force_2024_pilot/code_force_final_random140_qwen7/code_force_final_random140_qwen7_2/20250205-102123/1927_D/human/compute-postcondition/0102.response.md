Output State: **`q` is `q - 1`; `l` is the return value of `R()`, `r` is the return value of `R()`**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `q` is `q - 1`. This means `q` is already decremented by 1. The code then assigns the return values of the function `R()` to the variables `l` and `r`. Since `R()` returns values, `l` and `r` are now holding those return values. The original value of `q` is no longer directly accessible, but we know it was `q - 1` before the code execution. Therefore, the output state reflects that `q` is `q - 1`, and `l` and `r` are the values returned by `R()`.
