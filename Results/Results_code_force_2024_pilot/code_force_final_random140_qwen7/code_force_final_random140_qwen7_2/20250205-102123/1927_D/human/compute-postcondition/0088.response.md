Output State: **`x` is a valid value returned by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`, `a` is increased by `2*j`, `i` is increased by 2, `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`, and `p` is now equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was increased by `1` due to some condition, making it `i+1`. Now, it is further incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `i+2`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
