Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is `x`.**

Explanation: The code `p = x` assigns the value of `x` to `p`. The values of `a` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `x` and `p` are updated such that `p` now holds the value of `x`. The precondition that `x` is the next element in `R()` and `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p` remains valid. Since `p` is now equal to `x`, the condition for `j` does not affect its value.
