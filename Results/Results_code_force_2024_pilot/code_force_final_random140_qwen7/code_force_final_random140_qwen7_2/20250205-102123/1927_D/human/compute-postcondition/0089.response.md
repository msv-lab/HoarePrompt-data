Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in R()`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `x` is a valid value returned by `R()`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is a valid value returned by `R()`.
   - `p` is equal to `x`.
   - `a` is increased by `2*j`.
   - `i` is increased by `2`.
   - `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`.
   - `p` is now equal to `x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `x` being a valid value returned by `R()`, the only variable we need to adjust is `x`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `x` must be a valid value returned by `R()`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is a valid value returned by `R()`**
