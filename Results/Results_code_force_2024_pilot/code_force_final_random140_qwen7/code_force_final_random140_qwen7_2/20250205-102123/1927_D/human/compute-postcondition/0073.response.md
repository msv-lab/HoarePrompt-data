Output State: `q` is less than or equal to 0; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R().

After the loop executes all its iterations, `q` will eventually reach a value less than or equal to 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration. The values of `l` and `r` will be the most recent values returned by the function `R()` when the loop terminates.
