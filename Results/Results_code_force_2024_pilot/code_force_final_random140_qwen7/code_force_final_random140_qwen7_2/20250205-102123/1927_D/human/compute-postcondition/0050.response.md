Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is the next element in `R()`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`.**

Explanation: The code `a += j,` increments the value of `a` by `j`. The values of `x` and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The value of `j` remains as either `j` or `i` depending on the condition `x != p`.
