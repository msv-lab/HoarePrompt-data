Output State: **`q` is a non-zero value decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The initial state requires `q` to be non-zero. After executing `q -= 1`, `q` becomes a non-zero value decreased by 1. The precondition that `q` must be non-zero still holds true, but its exact value is now one less than what it was before.
