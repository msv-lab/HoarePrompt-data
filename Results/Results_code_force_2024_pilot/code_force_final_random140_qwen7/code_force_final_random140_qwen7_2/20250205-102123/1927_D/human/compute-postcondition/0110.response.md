Output State: `q` is 0; `l` is the return value of `R()` from the last iteration; `r` is the return value of `R()` from the last iteration; `a` is a list of integers where each element is either `j` or `i` based on the condition that `x` is not equal to `p` during each iteration; `i` is the total number of iterations performed; `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration; `t` is 0 (since it is decremented until it reaches 0); `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as a positive integer and is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `q`, `l`, and `r` will be the return values of the `R()` function calls made in the last iteration where the loop condition was still true. The list `a` will contain integers that are either `j` or `i` based on the condition specified, with `i` being the number of iterations performed and `j` being the value of `i` from the last iteration. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
