Output State: **`q` is less than or equal to 0; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R(); `t` is false**

Explanation: The code `R()` is called, but since no specific action or assignment is performed within the function call, the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, and `t` remain unchanged. The function `R()` returns values for `l` and `r`, but these values are not assigned to any variables in the given code snippet, so they are not updated. The variable `t` remains `false`.
