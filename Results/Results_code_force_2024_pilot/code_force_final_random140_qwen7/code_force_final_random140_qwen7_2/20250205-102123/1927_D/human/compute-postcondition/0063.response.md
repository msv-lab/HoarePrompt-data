Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `q` is 0.
   - `l` is a value returned by `R()`.
   - `r` is a value returned by `R()`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)` creates a tuple with two elements:
     - The first element is a tuple `(a[r], r)`.
     - The second element is a list `[-1] * 2` which is equivalent to `[-1, -1]`.
   - The condition `[a[r] < l]` evaluates to either `True` (which is treated as `1`) or `False` (which is treated as `0`).
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the expression inside the square brackets evaluates to `1`, and the entire expression evaluates to the first element of the tuple `((a[r], r))`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the expression inside the square brackets evaluates to `0`, and the entire expression evaluates to the second element of the tuple `([-1, -1])`.

4. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`:
     - The expression evaluates to `(a[r], r)`.
     - The `*` operator unpacks this tuple, so the print statement will print `a[r]` followed by `r`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`:
     - The expression evaluates to `[-1, -1]`.
     - The `*` operator unpacks this list, so the print statement will print `-1` followed by `-1`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the exact values of `a[r]` and `l` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values to be printed.
   - However, we know that the print statement will either print `(a[r], r)` if `a[r] < l` is `True`, or it will print `(-1, -1)` if `a[r] < l` is `False`.

Given the information, the output will depend on the comparison between `a[r]` and `l`. Therefore, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l, otherwise (-1, -1)**
