Output State: **`q` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `l` is the return value of R(), `r` is the return value of R().**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` calls the function `R()` which returns two values. These values are assigned to `l` and `r`. The initial state of `q` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, which remains unchanged. Therefore, `q` is still a non-zero value decreased by 1, while `l` and `r` take the values returned by the function `R()`.
