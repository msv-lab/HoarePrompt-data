The loop condition is `while q:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `q` is non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is a non-zero value decreased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be non-zero.

Since `q` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, it implies that `q` was non-zero before the decrement. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, `q` must be non-zero.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `q`.

State: **`q` must be non-zero**
