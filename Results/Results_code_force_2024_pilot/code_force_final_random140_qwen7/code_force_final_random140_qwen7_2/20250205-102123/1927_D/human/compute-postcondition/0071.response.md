Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `q` is greater than 0 and equal to its initial value minus 1.
   - `l` is a value returned by `R()`.
   - `r` is a value returned by `R()`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we need to determine its value from the context of the code.
   - The expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` will evaluate to one of two tuples based on the condition `a[r] < l`.
     - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, then the expression evaluates to `(a[r], r)`.
     - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, then the expression evaluates to `[-1] * 2`, which is `[-1, -1]`.

4. **Determining `a`**:
   - Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we need to infer it from the context. Given the nature of the problem and the fact that `a[r]` is being used, we can assume `a` is a list where `a[r]` is a valid index.
   - However, without knowing the exact values of `a`, `r`, and `l`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

5. **Final Output**:
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the output will be `a[r]` followed by `r`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the output will be `-1` twice.

Given the lack of explicit values for `a`, `r`, and `l`, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **a[r], r if a[r] < l, otherwise -1, -1**
