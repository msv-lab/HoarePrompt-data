Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. For each query, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n; R is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into a tuple of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that takes input from the user and splits it into a tuple of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This does not change the values of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`) but introduces a new function `R` which can be used later to read input in a specific format. The conditions and ranges for `n`, `a`, `q`, and the queries remain unchanged.
