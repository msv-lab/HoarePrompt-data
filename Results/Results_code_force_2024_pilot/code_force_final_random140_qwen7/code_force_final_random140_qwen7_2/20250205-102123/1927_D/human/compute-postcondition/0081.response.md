Output State: **`x` is a valid value returned by `R()`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`, `a` is increased by `j`.**

Explanation: The code `a += j` increments the value of `a` by `j`. The values of `x` and `p` remain unchanged from the initial state, and `j` remains either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`.
