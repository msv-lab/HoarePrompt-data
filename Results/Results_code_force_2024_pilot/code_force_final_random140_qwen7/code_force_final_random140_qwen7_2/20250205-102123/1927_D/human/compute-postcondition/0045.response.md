Output State: **`j` is assigned the tuple `(j, i)` where the first element is `j` and the second element is `i`, but only if `x` is not equal to `p`; `a` is a tuple containing the tuple `(j, i)`; the values of `R()`, `i`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a += j,` appends the tuple `j` (which is `(j, i)`) to the tuple `a`. Since `j` is only defined if `x` is not equal to `p`, the condition for `j` remains the same. The values of `R()`, `i`, `x`, and `p` are not affected by this operation.
