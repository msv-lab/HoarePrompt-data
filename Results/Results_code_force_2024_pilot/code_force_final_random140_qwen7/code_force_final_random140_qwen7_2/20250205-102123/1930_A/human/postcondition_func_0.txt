The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` and an integer `n`, followed by `2n` integers stored on a whiteboard. It then calculates and prints the sum of every second integer starting from the first one in the list of `2n` integers. After processing all `t` test cases, it ensures that `t` is reduced to `0`, and retains the values of `n` and the list `A` from the last test case for potential use.
