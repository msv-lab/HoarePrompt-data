The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**
