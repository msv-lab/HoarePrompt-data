Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `A`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `A` is updated to reflect the new list of integers.
