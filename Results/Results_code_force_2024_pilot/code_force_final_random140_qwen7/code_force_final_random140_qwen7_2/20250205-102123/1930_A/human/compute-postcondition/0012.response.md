Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t` and `A`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
