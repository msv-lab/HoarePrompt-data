Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy (non-zero).

3. **Analyze the initial state**: 
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
   - This means `t` could be any integer value input by the user.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero. If `t` is zero, the loop will not execute even once.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be modified such that `t` is non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be non-zero**
