Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program sums every second element in the list `A` starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This approach does not maximize the score according to the rules of the game.

To maximize the score, you should always choose the two smallest numbers available on the board for each move. The given solution does not ensure this optimal strategy.

Here's an example to illustrate why the current implementation is incorrect:

For the input:
```
3
1
2 3
2
1 1 2 1
3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The expected output is:
```
2
2
3
```

But the current program would output:
```
2
2
3
```

This looks correct at first glance, but let's consider another example:

For the input:
```
1
4
5 1 2 4
```

The expected output is:
```
7
```

But the current program would output:
```
8
```

The correct approach would be to sort the array and then sum up the elements at even indices (after sorting), which corresponds to picking the smallest pairs sequentially.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[i] for i in range(0, 2*n, 2)))
        t = t - 1
```

This corrected program sorts the array and then sums up the elements at even indices, ensuring the optimal score is achieved.
