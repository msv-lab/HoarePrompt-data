You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is `0`, `n` is an input integer (the last value read from input), `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (the last list read from input).
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to `0` since it starts as an input integer and decreases by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The values of `n` and `A` will be the ones read from the input during the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` and an integer `n`, followed by `2n` integers stored on a whiteboard. It then calculates and prints the sum of every second integer starting from the first one in the list of `2n` integers. After processing all `t` test cases, it ensures that `t` is reduced to `0`, and retains the values of `n` and the list `A` from the last test case for potential use.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the score according to the problem description. Specifically, the program simply sums every other element in the list starting from the first element (`A[::2]`), which does not guarantee the maximum score.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
3
1
2 3
2
1 1 2 1
3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

- Expected Output:
```
2
2
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
2
3
```

For the second test case `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, the program outputs `2`, but the correct maximum score is `2`. Here's a valid sequence of moves to achieve the maximum score:
1. Select \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\), add \(\min(1, 1) = 1\) to the score, leaving the board with \([2, 1]\).
2. Select \(x = 2\) and \(y = 1\), add \(\min(2, 1) = 1\) to the score, leaving the board empty.

Thus, the maximum score is `1 + 1 = 2`.

The program fails to consider the optimal pairing strategy, such as always pairing the smallest available numbers to maximize the score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
