Output State: **`balance` is either 3 or 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4, `char` is the third character of the string `s`, and the list `positions` now contains five tuples where the first element is either 3 or 1, and the second element is 2, 3, or 4, all with the third element being `char`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(balance, i, char)` to the list `positions`. Since `balance` can be either 3 or 1, `i` is 4, and `char` is the third character of the string `s`, the new tuple added to `positions` is one of the following: (3, 4, char) or (1, 4, char). The list `positions` originally contained four tuples, so now it contains five tuples. All other conditions remain unchanged.
