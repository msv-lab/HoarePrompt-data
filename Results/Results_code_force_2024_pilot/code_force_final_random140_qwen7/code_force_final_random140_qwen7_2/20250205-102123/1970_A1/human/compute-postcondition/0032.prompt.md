You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will have the following characteristics:
    #
    #- `balance` will be either the maximum value it reached during the loop (if the string `s` has more `(` than `)` characters) or 0 (if the string `s` has an equal number of `(` and `)` characters), or the minimum value it reached during the loop (if the string `s` has more `)` than `(` characters).
    #- `n` will be the length of the string `s`.
    #- `i` will be `n` (since the loop iterates over each character in the string, the last index will be `n-1`).
    #- `char` will be the last character of the string `s`.
    #- The list `positions` will contain a total of `n` tuples. Each tuple will have the form `(balance, i, char)`, where `balance` represents the balance of parentheses up to that point in the string, `i` is the index of the current character, and `char` is the character at that index.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` composed of the last character (`char`) from each tuple in the list `positions`, sorted by the `balance` in ascending order and by `-i` in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` which is a balanced parentheses sequence. It returns a string `result` made up of the last character from each tuple in the list `positions`, sorted first by `balance` in ascending order and then by `-i` in descending order.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `result` composed of the last character (`char`) from each tuple in the list `positions`, sorted by the `balance` in ascending order and by `-i` in descending order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
