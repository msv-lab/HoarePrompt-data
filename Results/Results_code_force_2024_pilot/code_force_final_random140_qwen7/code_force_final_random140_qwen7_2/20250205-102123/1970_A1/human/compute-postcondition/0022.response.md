Output State: **`balance` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4, `char` is the third character of the string `s`, and the list `positions` now contains four tuples `(1, 2, char)`, `(1, 3, char)`, `(1, 4, char)`**.

Explanation: The value of `balance` is decremented by 1, changing its value from either 2 or 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `positions` is updated to reflect the new value of `balance`.
