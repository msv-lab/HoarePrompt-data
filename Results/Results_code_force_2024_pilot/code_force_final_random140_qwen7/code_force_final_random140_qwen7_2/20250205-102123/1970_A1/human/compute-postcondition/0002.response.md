Output State: **`balance` is 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `positions` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `positions`. The values of `balance` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `balance` is still 0, `n` is still the length of the string `s`, and `positions` is an empty list.
