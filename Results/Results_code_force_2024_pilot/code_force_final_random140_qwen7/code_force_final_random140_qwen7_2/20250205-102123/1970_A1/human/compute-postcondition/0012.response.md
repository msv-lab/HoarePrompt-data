Output State: **`balance` is either 1 or -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `char` is the first character of the string `s`, and the list `positions` now contains one tuple `(balance, i, char)`**.

This means that the `positions` list has been appended with a tuple containing the current values of `balance`, `i`, and `char`. The values of `balance`, `n`, and `char` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, and `i` has been incremented by 1.
