Output State: **`balance` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of the string `s`**

Explanation: The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Initially, `balance` is 0, so after executing this line, `balance` becomes 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `char` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
