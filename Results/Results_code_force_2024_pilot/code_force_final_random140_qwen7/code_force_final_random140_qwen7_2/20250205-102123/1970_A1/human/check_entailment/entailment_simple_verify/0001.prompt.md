You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for (_, _, char) in positions])
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will have the following characteristics:
    #
    #- `balance` will be either the maximum value it reached during the loop (if the string `s` has more `(` than `)` characters) or 0 (if the string `s` has an equal number of `(` and `)` characters), or the minimum value it reached during the loop (if the string `s` has more `)` than `(` characters).
    #- `n` will be the length of the string `s`.
    #- `i` will be `n` (since the loop iterates over each character in the string, the last index will be `n-1`).
    #- `char` will be the last character of the string `s`.
    #- The list `positions` will contain a total of `n` tuples. Each tuple will have the form `(balance, i, char)`, where `balance` represents the balance of parentheses up to that point in the string, `i` is the index of the current character, and `char` is the character at that index.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` composed of the last character (`char`) from each tuple in the list `positions`, sorted by the `balance` in ascending order and by `-i` in descending order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program reads a balanced parentheses sequence from the input.
2. It calculates the balance of the prefix up to each character and stores the balance, position, and character in a list `positions`.
3. The list `positions` is sorted based on the balance in ascending order and position in descending order.
4. The sorted characters are then joined to form the final balanced shuffle sequence.

Let's verify the correctness of the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` and strips any leading/trailing whitespace.
2. **Calculating Balance**: The program correctly iterates through the string and calculates the balance at each position, storing the balance, position, and character in a list.
3. **Sorting**: The list `positions` is sorted according to the specified criteria (balance in ascending order and position in descending order). This ensures that the resulting sequence will have the required properties.
4. **Constructing Result**: The characters are extracted from the sorted list and joined to form the final result.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation.

Correctness: **True**
