Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input string `s` and calls the function `func_1(s)`.
2. The function `func_1` computes the balance of parentheses for each character in the string and stores these balances along with their corresponding indices and characters in a list `positions`.
3. The list `positions` is then sorted according to the specified criteria: first by the balance in ascending order, and then by the negative index in descending order.
4. Finally, the function constructs the resulting balanced shuffle by concatenating the characters from the sorted list.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` matches the definition of the balanced shuffle operation provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
