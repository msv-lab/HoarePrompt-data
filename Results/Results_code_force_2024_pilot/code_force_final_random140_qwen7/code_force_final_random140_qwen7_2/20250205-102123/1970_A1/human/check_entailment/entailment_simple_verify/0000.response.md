### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   ```python
   s = input().strip()
   print(func_1(s))
   ```
   - The program reads a balanced parentheses sequence `s` and calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
       n = len(s)
       balance = 0
       positions = []
       for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
           if char == '(':
               balance += 1
           else:
               balance -= 1
           positions.append((balance, i, char))
   ```
   - The function calculates the balance of each prefix of the string `s` and stores the balance, index, and character in a list `positions`.

3. **Sorting and Constructing Result:**
   ```python
   positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
   result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
   return result
   ```
   - The list `positions` is sorted first by `balance` in ascending order and then by `-i` (index) in descending order.
   - The result is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted list `positions`.

Now, let's verify the correctness of the program using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Verification:

- **Balance Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the balance of each prefix and stores it along with the index and character in the list `positions`.

- **Sorting:**
  - The sorting key ensures that characters are ordered first by their balance (non-negative balance is maintained) and then by their position in descending order (to handle ties).

- **Result Construction:**
  - The result is constructed by concatenating the characters from the sorted list `positions`. This ensures that the resulting sequence maintains the correct balance and order as specified.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the balanced shuffle operation, the program correctly implements the required logic. The program handles all potential cases correctly without any missing logic or edge cases that would cause it to fail.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
