### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` and strips any leading/trailing whitespace. This part is accurate and necessary for handling potential input formatting issues.

2. **Calculating Balance**: The program correctly iterates through the string and calculates the balance at each position, storing the balance, position, and character in a list. This is done using the `enumerate` function, which is appropriate for this task.

3. **Sorting**: The list `positions` is sorted based on the balance in ascending order and position in descending order. This sorting logic is correct and aligns with the problem description. The use of `lambda` to sort by multiple criteria is valid and ensures the desired order.

4. **Constructing Result**: The characters are extracted from the sorted list and joined to form the final result. This is done using a list comprehension and the `join` method, which is efficient and correct.

The provided function summary accurately describes the behavior of the `func_1` function. The program follows the steps outlined in the problem description and function summary without any apparent errors or discrepancies.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
