The function reads six integers from the input, representing the dimensions and coordinates of two points. Based on these inputs, it determines the winner of a game between Alice and Bob or declares a draw. In some cases, it returns the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the two points. The function does not return any value in most cases.
