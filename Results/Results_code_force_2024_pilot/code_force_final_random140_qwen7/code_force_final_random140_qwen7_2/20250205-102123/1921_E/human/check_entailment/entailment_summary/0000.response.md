Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine the outcome of a game between Alice and Bob based on their initial positions on a checkered board. The program reads the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, then calculates the outcome of the game based on the rules provided.

However, upon reviewing the code, several issues are identified:

1. **Incomplete Functionality**: The function `func_1()` does not correctly implement the logic for determining the game outcome. Specifically, it does not handle all edge cases and does not fully simulate the optimal moves for both players.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for determining the winner is flawed. For example, the condition `if (x2 - x1) % 2 != 0` is used to determine the winner, which is not aligned with the game rules. The game outcome should depend on whether Alice or Bob can force a win by moving into the opponent's position.
3. **Inconsistent Return Values**: The function does not consistently return the correct values for "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw". Instead, it sometimes returns an absolute difference between y-coordinates, which is not part of the expected output format.
4. **Lack of Optimal Strategy Simulation**: The program does not simulate the optimal moves for both players. It makes assumptions about the positions and movements without fully considering the constraints and possibilities of the game.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the game outcome based on the given problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **False**
