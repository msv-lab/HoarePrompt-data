Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner based on the positions of Alice's and Bob's chips is flawed.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
2 2 1 1 2 2
```
- Alice starts at (1, 1).
- Bob starts at (2, 2).

According to the rules:
- Alice can only move down, down-right, or down-left.
- Bob can only move up, up-right, or up-left.

In this case, Alice can move to (2, 1), and Bob can move to (1, 2). Since Alice can force Bob into a position where he loses (by moving to (2, 1)), Alice should win. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario and might incorrectly determine a draw or another outcome.

The program needs to correctly simulate the moves and outcomes for all possible scenarios to ensure it handles the game logic accurately.
