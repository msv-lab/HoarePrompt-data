Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the game outcome. Here are some key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Moves and Conditions:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the conditions for Alice and Bob's moves. Specifically, it does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The logic for checking if a player can force a win is flawed. For instance, the program does not properly account for all possible moves and outcomes.

2. **Simplistic and Incomplete Logic:**
   - The program attempts to simplify the problem but fails to handle all edge cases and optimal strategies. For example, it does not correctly determine when a player can force a win by blocking the opponent's moves.
   - The program does not fully consider the dynamic nature of the game where players can strategically move to block each other.

3. **Incomplete Functionality:**
   - The function `func_1()` is incomplete and does not fully implement the game logic. It lacks proper handling of all possible scenarios and does not provide a clear path to determine the winner or a draw.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to implement a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving game theory or dynamic programming to simulate the optimal moves for both players. The current implementation does not accurately reflect the rules and optimal strategies of the game.
