Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' with an additional 'Draw' appended, `i` is 3, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `answers` now contains all its previous elements plus the new element `'Draw'`.
