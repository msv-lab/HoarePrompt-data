Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`**.

Explanation: The code `x2 -= a` subtracts `a` from `x2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `x2` is updated to `x2 - a`. The rest of the conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
