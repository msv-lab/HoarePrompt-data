Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', 'Draw', and 'Bob', `i` is 3, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Bob')` adds the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, or `'Alice'`. After appending `'Bob'`, `answers` now contains `'Alice'`, `'Draw'`, and `'Bob'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
