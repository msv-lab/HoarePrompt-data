Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces.
   - `n` is the first element of `r`.
   - `m` is the second element of `r`.
   - `x1` is increased by 1 plus `a`.
   - `y1` is either incremented by 1 minus `a` or `a`.
   - `x2` is the fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`.
   - `y2` is either 1 or the second element of `r`.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.
   - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - The condition either \((\text{abs}(y2 - 1) < \text{abs}(y2 - m))\) or \((\text{abs}(y2 - 1) \geq \text{abs}(y2 - m))\) does not hold.
   - `c` is either `y1 - 1` or `m - y1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('draw')
   ```

Given the print statement `print('draw')`, it directly prints the string `'draw'`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `b`, `c`) do not affect the output of this print statement because the print statement is simply printing a fixed string.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **draw**
