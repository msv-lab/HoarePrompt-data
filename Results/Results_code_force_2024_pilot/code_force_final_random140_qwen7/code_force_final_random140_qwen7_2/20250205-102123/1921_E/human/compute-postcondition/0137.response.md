Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', and 'Alice', `i` is 3, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, or `'Alice'`. After appending `'Alice'`, `answers` now contains `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, and `'Alice'`. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` remain unchanged.
