Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it determines whether the points \((x_a, y_a)\) and \((x_b, y_b)\) are distinct and, based on certain conditions, appends one of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each string in the list. The final state of the program includes a list of results for each test case and the printing of these results.**
