Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw' appended to it, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Draw')` appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `i`, and `clues`) remain unchanged.
