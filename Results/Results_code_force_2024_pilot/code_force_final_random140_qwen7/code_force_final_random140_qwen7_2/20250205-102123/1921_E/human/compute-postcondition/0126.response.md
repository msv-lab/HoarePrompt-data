Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', `i` is 3 if `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, otherwise `i` is 4. `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.
