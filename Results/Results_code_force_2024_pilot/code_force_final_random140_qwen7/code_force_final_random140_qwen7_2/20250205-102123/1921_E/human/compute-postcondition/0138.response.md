Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', 'Alice', `i` is 4, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, or `'Alice'`, and after appending `'Alice'`, it now contains `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, and `'Alice'`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 because of the line `i += 1` (though this line is not provided in the snippet, it is implied by the initial state where `i` is 3). All other variables remain unchanged.
