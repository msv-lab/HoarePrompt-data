Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by 1 plus `a`, `y1` is either incremented by 1 minus `a` or `a`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `y2` is either 1 or the second element of `r`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, and the condition either `(abs(y2 - 1) < abs(y2 - m))` or `(abs(y2 - 1) ≥ abs(y2 - m))` does not hold, `c` is either `y1 - 1` or `m - y1`.
