Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is the third element of r, y1 is one more than the original y1, x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r, the difference between x2 and x1 is odd, y1 is not equal to y2, and currently y2 is greater than y1**.

This means that the value of `y1` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
