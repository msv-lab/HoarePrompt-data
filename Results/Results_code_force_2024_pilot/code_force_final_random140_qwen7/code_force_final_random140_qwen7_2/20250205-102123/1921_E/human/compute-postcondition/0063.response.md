Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and the current value of `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`; `a` is `y1 - 1`.**

This means that the value of `a` is calculated as `y1 - 1`, while all other variables retain their original values and conditions.
