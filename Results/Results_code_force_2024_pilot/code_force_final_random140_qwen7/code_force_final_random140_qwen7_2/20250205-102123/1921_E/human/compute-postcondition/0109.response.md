Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list. If `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. `i` remains 2, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
