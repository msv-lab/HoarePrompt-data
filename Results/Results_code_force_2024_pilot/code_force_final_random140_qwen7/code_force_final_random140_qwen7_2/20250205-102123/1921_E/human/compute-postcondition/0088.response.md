Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`, `y1` and `y2` are the fourth and sixth elements of `r` respectively, adjusted according to the if condition, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, and either `y1` is 1 or `y1` is `m`.
