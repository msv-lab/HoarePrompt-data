Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, and each element in r is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `r = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `r`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still a positive integer within the specified range. The values of `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are now stored in the list `r` as integers.
