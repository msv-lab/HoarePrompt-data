Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is the third element of r, y1 is reduced by 1, x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r, the difference between x2 and x1 is odd, and y1 is not equal to y2, and y2 is less than or equal to y1.**

This means that the value of `y1` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2` are still valid, and `t`, `r`, `n`, `m` retain their original values.
