Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces.
- `n` is the first element of `r`.
- `m` is the second element of `r`.
- `x1` is increased by 1 plus `a`.
- `y1` is either incremented by 1 minus `a` or `a`.
- `x2` is the fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`.
- `y2` is either 1 or the second element of `r`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.
- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
- The condition either \((\text{abs}(y2 - 1) < \text{abs}(y2 - m))\) or \((\text{abs}(y2 - 1) \geq \text{abs}(y2 - m))\) holds.
- `c` is either `y1 - 1` or `m - y1`.
- The condition \((b // 2 > a \text{ and } \text{abs}(x2 - c) \geq x1 + c \text{ and } (1 \leq y1 \leq m) \text{ and } (1 \leq x1 \leq n))\) is true.

Given this information, the print statement is simply:

```
print('Alice')
```

This will print the string "Alice".

Output: **Alice**
