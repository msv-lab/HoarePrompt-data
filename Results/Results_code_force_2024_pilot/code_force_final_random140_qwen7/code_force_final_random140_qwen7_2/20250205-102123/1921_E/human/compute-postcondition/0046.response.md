Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by 1 plus `a`, `y1` is incremented by `a`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `y2` is the second element of `r`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, and `(abs(y2 - 1) ≥ abs(y2 - m))` holds, `c` is `m - y1`.**

This output state reflects that the variable `c` has been assigned the value `m - y1`, while all other variables retain their previous conditions and values as described in the initial state.
