Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice', and `i` is 4. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1`, then `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, and `answers` remains as ['Bob', 'Draw', 'Alice']. Otherwise, if `clues[3] < clues[5]`, `i` is set to 4 and `answers` remains as ['Bob', 'Draw', 'Alice']. If `clues[3] > clues[5]` and `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, an additional 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, `i` is set to 4 and `answers` remains as ['Bob', 'Draw', 'Alice'].
