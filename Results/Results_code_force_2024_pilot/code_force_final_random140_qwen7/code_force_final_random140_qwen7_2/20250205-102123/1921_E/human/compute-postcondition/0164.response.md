Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b, where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9. The function also accepts a positive integer t such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the function determines whether (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) are distinct points and returns a boolean value indicating whether the coordinates are different.**

Note: The actual return type (e.g., a list of boolean values, a single boolean value, etc.) is not specified in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the process rather than the exact return type.
