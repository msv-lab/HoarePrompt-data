Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', 'Bob', and 'Draw', `i` is 3, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The line `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Bob'` or `'Alice'`, so after appending `'Draw'`, the list now contains `'Alice'`, `'Bob'`, and `'Draw'`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `i`, and `clues`) remain unchanged.
