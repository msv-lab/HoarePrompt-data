Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing one of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' for each test case, and `i` is 9 (or any value up to `test_cases - 1`).**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, `answers` will contain the results for all `test_cases` based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The value of `i` will be the last index that was processed, which is `test_cases - 1`. The exact contents of `answers` depend on the input provided for each test case during the loop's execution.
