Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by 1, `y1` is incremented by 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.**

Explanation: The code `b = x2 - x1` calculates the difference between `x2` and `x1` and assigns it to `b`. Since `x2` and `x1` are already defined and their difference is odd, `b` will be that odd difference. All other variables remain unchanged.
