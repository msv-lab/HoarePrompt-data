Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, the condition inside the if block is checked and either 'Bob' or 'Draw' is appended to `answers` based on specific conditions. If the absolute difference is not 1, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**
