Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `answers` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
        answers.append('Draw')
    elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2
        ] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0:
        if clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
            if clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
    elif clues[3] == clues[5]:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
        if clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
        if clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' based on specific conditions, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces. If the second element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, or the first element of `clues` is equal to 1, `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' based on the following conditions: if both the second and fourth elements of `clues` are even or both are odd, `answers` contains 'Bob' or 'Alice' if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the result of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2`, otherwise `answers` contains 'Bob'. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the fifth element of `clues` is equal to the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, otherwise `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the second and fourth elements of `clues` have different parities, `answers` contains 'Alice' if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference is not 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw' if `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]` and the difference between the second and third elements of `clues` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues`. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the condition `(clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' based on specific conditions, `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, `answers` will contain 'Draw'. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, and `clues[3] == clues[5]`, 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[3] == clues[5]` and the condition inside the else block is met, 'Alice' is added to `answers`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]`, 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Draw' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, the condition inside the if block is checked and either 'Bob' or 'Draw' is added to `answers` based on specific conditions. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to `answers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', and `i` is either 3 or 4. If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, then `i` remains 3 and `answers` remains unchanged. If `clues[2] <= clues[4]` and `clues[0] != 1`, then `i` is 4 and `answers` is rearranged to ['Alice', 'Draw', 'Bob'] if `clues[2] % 2 != clues[4] % 2` and `clues[3] == clues[5]`. Otherwise, `i` is 4 and `answers` is rearranged to ['Alice', 'Draw', 'Bob'] if `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) != 1` and `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, or `answers` remains as ['Bob', 'Draw', 'Alice'] if `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
