Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

1. **Cumulative Counts and Sums Construction**: The program correctly constructs cumulative counts (`ones`) and sums (`sum`) for the array elements. This allows efficient computation of the number of `1`s and the sum within any subarray.

2. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates the number of `1`s (`onesInRange`) and the sum (`sumInRange`) within the specified subarray. It then checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \le \text{sumInRange}\) holds. This condition effectively checks if it's possible to transform the subarray into a "good" array as per the problem definition.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray consists of a single element (i.e., \(l = r\)), printing 'NO' in such cases.

Given these points, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and should produce the correct output for the given examples and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
