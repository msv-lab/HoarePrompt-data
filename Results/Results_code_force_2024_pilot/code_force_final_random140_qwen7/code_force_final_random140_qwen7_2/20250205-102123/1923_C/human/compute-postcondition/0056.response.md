Functionality: **The function processes a series of queries on a given array. It first constructs cumulative counts and sums for the array elements. Then, for each query, it checks if a specific condition is met based on the subarray defined by the query indices. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results of the queries.**
