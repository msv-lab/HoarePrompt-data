Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumInRange` is defined as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- `onesInRange` is unchanged, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `q` is `q - 1`, but since `q` is not used in the print statement, this detail is irrelevant.
- `l` is the integer entered first.
- `r` is the integer entered second.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
