Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip any remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `q`, `l`, `r`, or their relationships, these conditions remain unchanged.
