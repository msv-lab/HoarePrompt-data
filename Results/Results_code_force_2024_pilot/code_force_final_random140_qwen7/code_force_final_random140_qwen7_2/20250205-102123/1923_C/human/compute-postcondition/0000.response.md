Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `q` from input using `map(int, input().split(' '))`. This means `n` and `q` are now assigned the values of the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively. However, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
