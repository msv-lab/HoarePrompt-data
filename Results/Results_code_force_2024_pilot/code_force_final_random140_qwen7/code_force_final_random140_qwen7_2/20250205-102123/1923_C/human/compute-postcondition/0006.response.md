Output State: **`i` is 1; `ones[1]` is `ones[0]` + (1 if `nums[0]` == 1 else 0); `sum[1]` is `sum[0]` + `nums[0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` array such that `sum[i]` is equal to `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `ones[1]` is `ones[0]` + (1 if `nums[0]` == 1 else 0), the value of `sum[1]` is updated to include `nums[0]`. Therefore, `sum[1]` is now `sum[0] + nums[0]`. The values of `i` and `ones[1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
