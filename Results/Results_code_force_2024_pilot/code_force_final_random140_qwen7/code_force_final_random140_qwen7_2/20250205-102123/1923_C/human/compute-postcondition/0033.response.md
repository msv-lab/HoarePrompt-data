Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumInRange` is defined as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are integers from the input, but their specific values are not provided.
- The `print('NO')` statement is executed.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `sumInRange`. However, the `print('NO')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `l`, `r`, or `sumInRange`.

Output: **NO**
