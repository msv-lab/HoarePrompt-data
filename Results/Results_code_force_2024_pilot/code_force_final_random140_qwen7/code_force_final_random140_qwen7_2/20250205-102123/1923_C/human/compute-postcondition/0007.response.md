Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ones[1]` is `ones[0]` + (1 if `nums[0]` == 1 else 0).
   - `sum[1]` is `sum[0]` + `nums[0]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` must be such that `i` can still be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `ones[2]` will be calculated based on the previous values.
   - `sum[2]` will be calculated based on the previous values.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `ones[2]` is `ones[1]` + (1 if `nums[0]` == 1 else 0), `sum[2]` is `sum[1]` + `nums[0]`**.
