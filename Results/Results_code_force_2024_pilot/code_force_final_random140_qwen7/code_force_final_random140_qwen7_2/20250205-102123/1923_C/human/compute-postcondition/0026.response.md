Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumInRange` is defined as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are integers from the input.
- The condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange)` is satisfied.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The output of this print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any other variables or objects. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
