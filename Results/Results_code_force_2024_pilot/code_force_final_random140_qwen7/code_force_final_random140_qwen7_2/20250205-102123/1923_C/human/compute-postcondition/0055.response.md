Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer t, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. For each query, it calculates and returns the sum of elements in the subarray from index l_i to r_i inclusive.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases (indicated by t), each containing an array c and a series of queries. It processes each query by summing up the elements within the specified range of the array and returns these sums accordingly.
