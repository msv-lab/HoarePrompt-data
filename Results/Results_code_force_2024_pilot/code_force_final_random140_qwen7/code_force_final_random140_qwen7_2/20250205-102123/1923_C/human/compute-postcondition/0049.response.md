Output State: **`sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is unchanged, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` is the integer entered first, `r` is the integer entered second.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `sumInRange` to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. This does not affect the values of `onesInRange`, `q`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
