Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n`; `ones[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` where the value is 1; `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of the number 1s up to each index, and the `sum` list will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input. If the condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange)` is satisfied, then the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is unchanged, `q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are updated to the values entered by the user, and the loop continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` remains unchanged, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` is the integer entered first, `r` is the integer entered second.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
