Postcondition: **`sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is unchanged, `q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are updated to the values entered by the user, and the loop continues.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true or false, the values of `sumInRange`, `onesInRange`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain as specified in the precondition, and the loop continues.
