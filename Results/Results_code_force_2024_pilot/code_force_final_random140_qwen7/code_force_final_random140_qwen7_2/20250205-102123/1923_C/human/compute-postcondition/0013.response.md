Output State: `i` is `n`, `ones[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` that are equal to 1, `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. The variable `ones[i]` will store the count of all 1s in the list `nums` up to index `i`. Therefore, `ones[n]` will be the total count of 1s in `nums`. The variable `sum[i]` will store the cumulative sum of all elements in `nums` up to index `i`. Thus, `sum[n]` will be the sum of all elements in `nums`.
