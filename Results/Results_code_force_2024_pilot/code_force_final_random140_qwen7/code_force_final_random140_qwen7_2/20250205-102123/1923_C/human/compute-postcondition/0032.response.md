Output State: **`sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `l` and `r` are updated to the values entered by the user, separated by a space.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `l` and `r` from the input, separated by a space, and assigns them to the variables `l` and `r`. The values of `sumInRange`, `q`, and the original values of `l` and `r` from the initial state remain unchanged. The new values of `l` and `r` are the ones entered by the user.
