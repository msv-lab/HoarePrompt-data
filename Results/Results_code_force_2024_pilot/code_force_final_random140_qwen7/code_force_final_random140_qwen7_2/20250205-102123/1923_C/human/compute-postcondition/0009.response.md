Output State: **`i` is 2, `ones[2]` is `ones[1]` + (1 if `nums[0]` == 1 else 0) + (1 if `nums[1]` == 1 else 0), `sum[2]` is `sum[1]` + `nums[0]`, `sum[2]` is updated to `sum[2] + nums[1]`**

Explanation: The code updates `sum[i]` to `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `sum[i]` becomes `sum[2]`, which is updated to `sum[2] + nums[1]`. The values of `i`, `ones[2]`, and `sum[2]` remain as per their initial definitions, with `ones[2]` being calculated based on the values of `ones[1]`, `nums[0]`, and `nums[1]`, and `sum[2]` being updated to include `nums[1]`.
