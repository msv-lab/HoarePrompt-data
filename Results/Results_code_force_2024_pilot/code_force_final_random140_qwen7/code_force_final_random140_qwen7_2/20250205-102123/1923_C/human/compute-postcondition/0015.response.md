Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop, typically used when the variable itself is not needed within the loop body. It doesn't affect the state.
   - `q`: This is the range parameter for the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as:
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `ones[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` where the value is 1.
   - `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.

3. **Adjust the State for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the key factor is the value of `q`. The loop will run `q` times. Therefore, `q` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **State Adjustment**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `q` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`i`, `ones`, and `sum`) are not directly affected by the loop head but are part of the overall state.

Given this analysis, the state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `q` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
