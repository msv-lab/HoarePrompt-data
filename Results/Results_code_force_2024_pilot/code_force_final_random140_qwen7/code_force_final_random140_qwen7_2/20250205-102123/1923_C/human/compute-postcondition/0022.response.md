Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code calculates `onesInRange` as the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]`. Since `l` and `r` are integers from the input and the condition `l == r` does not change their values, they remain as originally inputted. The value of `q` remains greater than 0 as per the initial condition.
