Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumInRange` is defined as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are integers from the input.
- The condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange)` is true.

Given these conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will execute and print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
