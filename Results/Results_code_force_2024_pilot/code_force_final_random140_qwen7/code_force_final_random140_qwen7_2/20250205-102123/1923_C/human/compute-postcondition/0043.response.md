Output State: **`sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is unchanged, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` is the integer entered first, `r` is the integer entered second.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. It does not change the value of `sumInRange`, `onesInRange`, or `q`. The variable `q` is decremented by 1 because it was initially greater than 0. The values of `l` and `r` are updated to the integers entered by the user.
