Output State: **`sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are updated to the values entered by the user, separated by a space, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `sumInRange`, `q`, `l`, or `r`, their values remain the same as before the `continue` statement was executed. The values of `l` and `r` are updated to the values entered by the user, and the loop continues.
