Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- `onesInRange` is unchanged.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are updated to the values entered by the user.
- The loop continues.

The `print('YES')` statement is executed outside of any conditional logic that would depend on the values of `sumInRange`, `onesInRange`, `q`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, the print statement will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
