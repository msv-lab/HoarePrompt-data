Output State: **`sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is unchanged, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` is the integer entered first, `r` is the integer entered second, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, their previous values remain unchanged.
