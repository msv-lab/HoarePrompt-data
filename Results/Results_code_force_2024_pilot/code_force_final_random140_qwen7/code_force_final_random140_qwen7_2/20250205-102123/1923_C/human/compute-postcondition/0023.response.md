Output State: **`sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code calculates `sumInRange` as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. This updates the value of `sumInRange`, but does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
