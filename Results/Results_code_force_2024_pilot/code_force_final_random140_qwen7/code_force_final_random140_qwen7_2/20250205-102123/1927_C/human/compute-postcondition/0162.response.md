Postcondition: **`i` will be equal to `leftOnes`, `aOnes` will be incremented by 1 as many times as `aOnes` is less than `bOnes` during the loop, and `bOnes` will be incremented by 1 as many times as `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes` during the loop. Additionally, `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`**
