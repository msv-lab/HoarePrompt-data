Output State: **`t` is now equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces, `leftOnes` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOnes` is initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
