Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code creates a frozenset from the integers inputted by the user using the `map` function to convert the input (which is initially a string) into integers. The original values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The new variable `a` is assigned a frozenset of the integers entered by the user.
