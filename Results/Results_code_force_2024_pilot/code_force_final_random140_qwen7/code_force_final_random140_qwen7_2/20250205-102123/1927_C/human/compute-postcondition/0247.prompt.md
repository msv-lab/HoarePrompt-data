Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), and k is even. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    leftOnes = 0
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            leftOnes += 1
        elif i in a:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    i = 0
    while i < leftOnes:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `aOnes` is either incremented by 1 from its previous value (if `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` at the start of the iteration) or remains unchanged, `bOnes` is either incremented by 1 from its previous value (if `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes` at the start of the iteration) or remains unchanged, and `leftOnes` is 0. The condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` may or may not be true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the if-else block executes, `i` will be equal to `leftOnes`, `aOnes` will be incremented by 1 as many times as `aOnes` is less than `bOnes` during the loop, and `bOnes` will be incremented by 1 as many times as `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes` during the loop. Additionally, either `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, or `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` and/or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `t` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces, `leftOnes` is the count of elements present in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the count of elements present in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the count of elements present in `b` but not in `a`, and if `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, the function does nothing (as `i` is already equal to `leftOnes`). Otherwise, either `aOnes` or `bOnes` is incremented each iteration based on their comparison, and `newk` remains as `k // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
