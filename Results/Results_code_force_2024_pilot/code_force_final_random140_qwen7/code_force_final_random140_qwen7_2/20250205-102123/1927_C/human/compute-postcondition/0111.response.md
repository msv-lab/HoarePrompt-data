Postcondition: `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` remains unchanged. If `i` is not in `a`, then `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is in `b`. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
