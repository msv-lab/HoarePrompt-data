Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, and since `leftOnes` is 0, `i` is also 0.
- `aOnes` is either incremented by 1 if it was less than `bOnes` at the start of the iteration, or remains unchanged.
- `bOnes` is either incremented by 1 if `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes` at the start of the iteration, or remains unchanged.
- The condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is true.

Given these conditions, let's break down the scenario:

1. Since `leftOnes` is 0, `i` is also 0.
2. For the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` to be true, both `aOnes` and `bOnes` must be equal to `newk`.

The `print('yes')` statement will simply print the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
