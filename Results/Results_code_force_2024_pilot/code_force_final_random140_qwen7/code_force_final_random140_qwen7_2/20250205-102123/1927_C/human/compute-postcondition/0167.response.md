Output State: **`t` is now equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`, and then creates a frozenset from these integers. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
