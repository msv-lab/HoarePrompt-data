Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the count of elements present in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the count of elements present in `b` but not in `a`, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `bOnes` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the variable `bOnes` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
