Output State: **`t` is now equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`.**

The code `newk = k // 2` assigns the value of `k // 2` (integer division of `k` by 2) to the variable `newk`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
