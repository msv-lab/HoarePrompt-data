Output State: **`i` is less than `leftOnes`, `bOnes` is `bOnes` + 1, and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`.**

Explanation: The code `bOnes += 1` increments the value of `bOnes` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `i` is still less than `leftOnes`, `bOnes` has increased by 1, and `aOnes` remains greater than or equal to `bOnes`.
