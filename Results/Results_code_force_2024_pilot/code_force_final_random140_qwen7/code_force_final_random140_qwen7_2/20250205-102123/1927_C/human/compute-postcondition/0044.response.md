Output State: **`leftOnes` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` must be at least 4, `a` is a frozenset, `b` is a frozenset, `aOnes` is 0 or 1, `bOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `leftOnes` is incremented by 1. Since `leftOnes` was either 0 or 1, after incrementing it becomes either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
