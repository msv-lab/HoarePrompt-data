Output State: **`leftOnes` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `aOnes` is `aOnes` + 1**

Explanation: The code `aOnes += 1` increments the value of `aOnes` by 1. The initial conditions state that `leftOnes` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1, otherwise `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Since the exact initial values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` are not specified, the only change is that `i` is incremented by 1 to 2, and `aOnes` is increased by 1.
