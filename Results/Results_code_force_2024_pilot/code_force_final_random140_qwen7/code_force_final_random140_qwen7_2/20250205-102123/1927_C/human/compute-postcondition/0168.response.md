Output State: **`t` is now equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads a new line of space-separated integers using `input().split()`, converts each integer to an int using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a frozenset from these integers. This new frozenset is assigned to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
