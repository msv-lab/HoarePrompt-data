Output State: **`leftOnes` is 0, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `k // 2` to the variable `newk`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `newk` is the integer division of `k` by 2. All other variables retain their initial states.
