The variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `k` must be at least 4. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i <= k` must still hold true.

Since `i` is currently 3, `k` must still be at least 4 to satisfy the condition `i <= k`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is at least 4.

State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be at least 4**
