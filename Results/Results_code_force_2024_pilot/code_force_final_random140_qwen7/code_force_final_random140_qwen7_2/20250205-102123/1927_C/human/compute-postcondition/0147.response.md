Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `aOnes` must be less than `bOnes` or they both satisfy the condition where one is incremented by 1 based on their comparison, and `leftOnes` remains unchanged.**

This means that `i` has been incremented by 1, and the conditions for `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain the same as the initial postcondition, with `leftOnes` staying the same since no operation was performed on it.
