Postcondition: **`leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` must be at least 3, `a` is a frozenset, `b` is a frozenset, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2. If `i` is in `a`, then `bOnes` remains unchanged. If `i` is not in `a`, then `bOnes` is set to 1 if `i` is in `b`, otherwise the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
