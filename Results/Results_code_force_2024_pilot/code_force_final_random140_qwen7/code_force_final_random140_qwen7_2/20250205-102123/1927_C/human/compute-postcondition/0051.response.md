Postcondition: **`leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` must be at least 4, `a` is a frozenset, `b` is a frozenset, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then the postcondition remains as in the else part. Otherwise, if `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` remains 1. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` becomes 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
