Postcondition: `leftOnes` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` must be at least 1, `a` is a frozenset, `b` is a frozenset, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is set to 1. If `i` is not in `b`, then `i` is broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
