Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `leftOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, and `k` must be at least 2. If `i` is found in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is found only in `a`, `aOnes` remains 1. If `i` is found only in `b`, `bOnes` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is not found in either `a` or `b`, the loop or statement is exited.**
