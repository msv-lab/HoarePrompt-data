Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `t` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the count of elements present in `a` but not in `b`, and `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`, otherwise `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and `bOnes` remains unchanged, `newk` is `k // 2`**.
