Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < leftOnes`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `leftOnes` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is set to `bOnes + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < leftOnes`.
   - Currently, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `leftOnes` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `leftOnes` must be greater than 1.

4. **Consider the loop body**:
   - The loop body does not directly affect `leftOnes`, `i`, `aOnes`, or `bOnes` in a way that would change the loop condition.
   - The loop body might update `aOnes` and `bOnes`, but these updates do not impact the loop continuation condition `i < leftOnes`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `leftOnes` to ensure that `i < leftOnes` holds true in the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, `leftOnes` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `leftOnes` must be greater than 1**.
