Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `t` in the expression `for t in range(int(input())):`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem statement mentions that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` could be any integer within this range.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 1 (since `t` starts from 1).

4. **Adjust the state**: Given the above points, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is greater than 1. Additionally, since `t` starts from 1, we need to ensure that `t` is set to 1 initially.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `t` should be set to 1.
- The input to `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is 1, the input to `int(input())` must be greater than 1**
