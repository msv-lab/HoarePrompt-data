Output State: **After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `leftOnes`, `aOnes` will be incremented by 1 as many times as `aOnes` is less than `bOnes` during the loop, and `bOnes` will be incremented by 1 as many times as `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes` during the loop.**

In more detail, since the loop continues as long as `i < leftOnes`, once `i` equals `leftOnes`, the loop will terminate. During each iteration, either `aOnes` or `bOnes` is incremented depending on their comparison. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` gets incremented; otherwise, `bOnes` gets incremented. The variable `i` keeps track of how many times the loop has executed and will finally be equal to `leftOnes` when the loop ends.
