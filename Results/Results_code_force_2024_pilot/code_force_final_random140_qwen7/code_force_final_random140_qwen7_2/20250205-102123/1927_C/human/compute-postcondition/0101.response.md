Output State: **`leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, and `i` is in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `aOnes += 1` increments the value of `aOnes` by 1. Initially, `aOnes` was 0, so after executing this line, `aOnes` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
