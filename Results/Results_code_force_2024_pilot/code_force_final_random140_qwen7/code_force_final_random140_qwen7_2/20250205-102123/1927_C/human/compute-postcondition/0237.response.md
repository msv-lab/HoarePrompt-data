Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces, `leftOnes` must be greater than 2, if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1, otherwise `bOnes` is incremented by 1, `newk` is `k // 2`.
