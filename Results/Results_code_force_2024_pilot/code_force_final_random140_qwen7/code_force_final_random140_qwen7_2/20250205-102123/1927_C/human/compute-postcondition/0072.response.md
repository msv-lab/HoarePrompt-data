Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `aOnes` is `aOnes` + 1; `bOnes` is unchanged; `leftOnes` must be greater than 3**.

Explanation: The code `aOnes += 1` increments the value of `aOnes` by 1. Since `aOnes` was either `aOnes` + 1 (if `aOnes` < `bOnes`) or remained unchanged before, now it will be `aOnes` + 1. The value of `bOnes` remains unchanged because the condition for incrementing `bOnes` (`aOnes` >= `bOnes`) was not met. The precondition that `leftOnes` must be greater than 3 is still valid. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
