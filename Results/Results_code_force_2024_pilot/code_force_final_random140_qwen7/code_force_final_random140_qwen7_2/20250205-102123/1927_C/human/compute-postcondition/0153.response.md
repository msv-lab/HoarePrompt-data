Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < leftOnes`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged unless `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, in which case `aOnes` is incremented by 1.
3. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `leftOnes`.

Given that `i` has been incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. For the loop to continue, the new value of `i` must still be less than `leftOnes`. Therefore, the condition `i + 1 < leftOnes` must hold true.

Since `i` has been incremented by 1, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` itself. We need to ensure that `i` is such that `i + 1 < leftOnes`.

**State:**
- `i` must be less than `leftOnes - 1`

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` must be less than `leftOnes - 1`, `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged**
