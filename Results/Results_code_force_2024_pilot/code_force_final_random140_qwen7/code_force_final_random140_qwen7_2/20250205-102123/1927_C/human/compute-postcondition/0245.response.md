Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `leftOnes`.
- `t` is `int(input()) - 1`.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input.
- `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces.
- `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces.
- `leftOnes` is the count of elements present in both `a` and `b`.
- `aOnes` is the count of elements present in `a` but not in `b`.
- `bOnes` is the count of elements present in `b` but not in `a`.
- `newk` is `k // 2`.
- `(aOnes != newk or bOnes != newk)` is a boolean expression.

The `print('no')` statement will print the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
