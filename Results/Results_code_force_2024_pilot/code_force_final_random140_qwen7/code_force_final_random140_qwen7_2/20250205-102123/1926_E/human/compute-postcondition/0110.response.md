Output State: **`m` is 8, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 0**

The code `s += n` increments the value of `s` by the value of `n`. Given that `n` is 0, `s` remains unchanged at 0. All other variables (`m`, `_`, `n`, `k`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables as they were in the initial state.
