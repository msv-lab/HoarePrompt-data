Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `n_back` is equal to `n`, `s` is equal to `n_back`, `m` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
