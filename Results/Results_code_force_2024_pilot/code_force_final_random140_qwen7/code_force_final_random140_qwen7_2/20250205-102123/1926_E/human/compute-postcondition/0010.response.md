Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is `(n_back + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `n_back` is equal to `n`, `s` is equal to `n_back`, `m` is 1, the current value of `n` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `s = n_back` assigns the value of `n_back` to `s`. Since `n_back` is equal to `n`, and `n` is currently 0, `s` is also set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
