Output State: **`m` is 4, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 1.**

The code `s += n` increments the value of `s` by the value of `n`. Given that `n` is 0, `s` remains unchanged and stays as 1. All other variables (`m`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `s`) are updated accordingly based on their initial states and the operation performed.
