Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `s < k`.
2. **Determine the current state of the loop variables**:
   - `s` is 1.
   - `k` is greater than 1.

3. **Check if the loop can execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must become less than `k` again.
   - Since `s` is currently 1 and `k` is greater than 1, `s < k` is true, and the loop can execute one more time.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `s` and `k`.
   - We need to ensure that `s` remains less than `k` for the loop to continue.
   - Since `s` is 1 and `k` is greater than 1, no adjustment is needed for `s` to remain less than `k`.

5. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - `m` is 2.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `k` is greater than 1.
   - `s` is 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Since the loop can certainly execute one more time without needing to change any additional states beyond those in the loop head, we only need to ensure that `s` remains less than `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` is 2, `_` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 1**.
