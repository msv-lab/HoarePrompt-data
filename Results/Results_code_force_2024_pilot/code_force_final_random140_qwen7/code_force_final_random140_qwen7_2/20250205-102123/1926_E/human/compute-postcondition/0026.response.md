Output State: **`m` is 4, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, `s` is 1**

The code `s += n` increments the value of `s` by the value of `n`. Given that `n` is 0, `s` remains unchanged and stays at 1. All other variables (`m`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `n_back`) are not affected by this operation.
