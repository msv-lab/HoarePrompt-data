Output State: `m` is 16, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `n_back` is equal to 1.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `m` doubles with each iteration as it starts from 2 and doubles three times (2 * 2 * 2 = 16). The variable `n` becomes 0 after the first iteration and remains 0 throughout the subsequent iterations since it is halved but starts at 0. The variable `s` is updated to 1 in the first iteration and then decreases by `n` (which is 0) in subsequent iterations, so it remains 0. The other variables (`_`, `k`, `n_back`) do not change during the loop's execution.
