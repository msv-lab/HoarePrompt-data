Output State: **`m` is 2, `_` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 1**

The code `s = n_back` does not appear to be correctly formatted, as `n_back` is not defined in the given initial state or within the code snippet. Since there is no definition or assignment for `n_back`, the value of `s` remains unchanged at 1. All other variables (`m`, `_`, `n`, `k`) retain their initial values.
