Output State: **`m` is 4, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 0**

Explanation: The code `s = n_back` assigns the value of `n_back` to `s`. However, `n_back` is not defined in the given initial state or within the provided code snippet. Since no specific value for `n_back` is provided, and there's no way to infer its value from the given information, the only change is that `s` is now equal to whatever `n_back` might be. But since `n_back` is not defined, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `s`. Therefore, `s` is simply updated to the value of `n_back`, which is not specified here. All other variables remain unchanged.
