Output State: **`m` is 4, `_` is 2, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 1.**

The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. Given that `n` was initially 1, after performing the operation `1 // 2` results in `0`. All other variables (`m`, `_`, `k`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
