Output State: `m` is 16, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, `s` is 1.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `m` doubles (`m *= 2`), `n` is halved (`n //= 2`), and `s` is incremented by the new value of `n`. The loop continues as long as `s < k`. Given that the loop executed 3 times, it means `m` has doubled three times, resulting in `m` being 8 * 2 = 16. Since `n` is halved each time and starts at 1, after 3 iterations, `n` becomes 0. The variable `s` remains 1 because `n` becomes 0 before the fourth iteration, causing the loop to break. The other variables (`_`, `k`, `n_back`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
