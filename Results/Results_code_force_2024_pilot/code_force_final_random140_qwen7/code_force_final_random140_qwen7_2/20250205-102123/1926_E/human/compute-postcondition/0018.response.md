The variables in the loop head are `s` and `k`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 1 and `k` is an input integer. For the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be less than `k`.

Given that `s` is currently 1, `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`m` is 2, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, `s` is 1**
