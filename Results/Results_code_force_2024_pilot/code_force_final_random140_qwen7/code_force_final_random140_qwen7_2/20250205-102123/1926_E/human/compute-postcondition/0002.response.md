Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the placeholder `_` (which is typically used to indicate a single underscore) is left as 1 since it was initially set to 1 and no operation changed its value.
