Output State: **`m` is 16, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `n_back` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `m` doubles every time `n` becomes 0, which occurs every two iterations. Starting from `m` being 1, after 15 iterations (since `t` ranges from 1 to 50,000 and considering the pattern of doubling every two iterations), `m` would be \(2^{16} = 65536\). However, given the constraints and the behavior described, `m` reaches 16 after 4 iterations, and since the loop exits when `n` becomes 0 and `s` no longer changes, `m` remains 16. The loop exits when `s` is no longer less than `k`, and since `n` is 0, `s` does not increase further. Thus, `s` becomes 0 after the loop exits, and `n` is set to 0. The other variables (`_`, `k`, `n_back`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
