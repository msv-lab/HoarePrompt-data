Output State: **`m` is 8, `_` is 2, `n` is 0, `k` must be greater than 4, `s` is 0**

The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. Given that `n` was initially 1, after the operation `n` becomes 0. All other variables (`m`, `_`, `k`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
