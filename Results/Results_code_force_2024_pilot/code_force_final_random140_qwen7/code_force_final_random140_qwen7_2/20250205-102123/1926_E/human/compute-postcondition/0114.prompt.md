Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    n_back = n
    s = (n + 1) // 2
    n = (n + 1) // 2
    m = 1
    while s < k:
        if n == 0:
            s = n_back
            n = 1
            break
        m *= 2
        n //= 2
        s += n
    print((2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `m` is 16, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, `s` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `s < k`. Given the output state after the loop executes 3 times, we can infer that `s` will eventually become equal to or greater than `k` after a certain number of iterations. Since `m` doubles with each iteration and `n` is halved, after 4 iterations (`m` would be 16), `n` would become 0, and the loop condition `s < k` would no longer be satisfied because `s` would remain 1 (as `n` is 0 and adding 0 does not change `s`). Therefore, the loop terminates, and the final values are `m` is 16, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, and `s` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `m` is 16, `_` is 2, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `s` is less than `k`. Given the output state after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce that `m` doubles each iteration (`m *= 2`), `n` is halved each iteration (`n //= 2`), and `s` increases by the value of `n` each iteration (`s += n`). Since `n` becomes 0 after the second iteration, it will remain 0 in subsequent iterations, and thus `s` will no longer increase. The loop will continue to run until `s` is no longer less than `k`, but since `n` is 0, `s` will not change further. Therefore, after all iterations, `m` will be 16 (doubling from 8 to 16), `n` will remain 0, `s` will remain 0, and the other variables will retain their initial or updated states from the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `m` is 16, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `n_back` is equal to 1.

Explanation: After the first three iterations, `m` doubles each time `n` becomes 0, which happens every two iterations. Starting from `m` being 1 initially, after 3 iterations, `m` would be \(2^4 = 16\). The condition `n == 0` triggers the break statement, causing `s` to be set to `n_back`, which remains 1, and then `n` is reset to 1. Since `n` is now 1 and the condition `n == 0` is no longer met, the loop will exit. Therefore, after all iterations, `m` will be 16, `n` will be 0, `s` will be 0 (as it gets updated to `n_back` and then stays there), and the other variables (`_`, `k`, `n_back`) will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
