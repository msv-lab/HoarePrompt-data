The loop condition is `s < k`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `s` must be less than `k` at the start of the next iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `m` is 2
- `_` is 0
- `n` is 0
- `k` is greater than 1
- `s` is 1
- `n_back` is equal to 1
- `s` is updated to 1 (This means `s` was set to 1 during the last iteration)

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be less than `k` at the start of the next iteration. Since `s` is currently 1 and `k` is greater than 1, `s` is already less than `k`.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the states related to the loop head.

State: **`m` is 2, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 1, `n_back` is equal to 1**
