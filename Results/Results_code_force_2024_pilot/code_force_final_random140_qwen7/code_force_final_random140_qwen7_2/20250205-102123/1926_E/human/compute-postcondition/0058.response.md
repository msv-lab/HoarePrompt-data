Output State: **`m` is 2, `_` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 1**

The code snippet `n = 1` simply reassigns the value of `n` to 1. Since `n` was previously 1, its value remains unchanged. All other variables (`m`, `_`, `k`, and `s`) retain their initial states as given in the initial state.
