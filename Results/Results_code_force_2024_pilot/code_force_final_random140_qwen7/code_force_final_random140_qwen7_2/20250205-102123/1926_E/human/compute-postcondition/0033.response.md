Output State: **`m` is 8, `_` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, `s` is equal to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `m` was originally 4. The code `m *= 2` multiplies `m` by 2, resulting in `m` becoming 8. All other variables remain unchanged.
