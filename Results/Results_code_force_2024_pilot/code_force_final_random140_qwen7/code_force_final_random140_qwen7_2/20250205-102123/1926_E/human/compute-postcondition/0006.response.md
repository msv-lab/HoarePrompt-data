Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is `(n_back + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `n_back` is equal to `n`, `s` is `(n_back + 1) // 2, `m` is 1**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `m`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `n_back`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
