Output State: **`m` is 2, `_` is 0, `n` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, and `n` is now 0.**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` performs an integer division of `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. Given that `n` was initially 1, performing `1 // 2` results in 0 (since integer division truncates the decimal part). All other variables (`m`, `_`, `k`, `s`, `n_back`) remain unchanged.
