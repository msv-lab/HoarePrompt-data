Output State: **`m` is 2, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `n_back` is equal to 1, `s` is equal to 1.**

The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and then floors the result to the nearest whole number. Given that `n` was initially 1, after the operation `n` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
