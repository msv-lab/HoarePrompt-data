Output State: **`m` is 16, `_` is 2, `n` is `(n_back + 1) // 2`, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 8**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` was originally an input integer (`n_back`), the new value of `n` is now `(n_back + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
