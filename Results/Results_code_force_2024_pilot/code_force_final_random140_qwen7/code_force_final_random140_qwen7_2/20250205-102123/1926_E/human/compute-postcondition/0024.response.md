Output State: **`m` is 4, `_` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, `s` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` multiplies the current value of `m` by 2. Given that the initial state of `m` is 2, after executing the code, `m` becomes 4. The values of the other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `n_back`, `s`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
