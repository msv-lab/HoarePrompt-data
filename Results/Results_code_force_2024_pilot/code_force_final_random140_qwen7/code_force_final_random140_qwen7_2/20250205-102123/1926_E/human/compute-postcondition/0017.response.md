Output State: **`m` is 2, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `n_back` is equal to 1, `s` is 1 (s was incremented by n, which is 0, so s remains 1).**

In this case, the variable `s` is incremented by `n`. Since `n` is 0, `s` remains unchanged at 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
