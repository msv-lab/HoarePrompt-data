The only variable in the loop head is `s`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 1, and `k` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be less than `k`.

Given the current state where `s` is 1 and `k` is greater than 1, `s` already satisfies the condition to enter the loop. However, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to maintain the condition `s < k`.

No other states need to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`m` is 4, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, `s` must be less than `k`**
