The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. Since the loop continues based on the value of `t`, we need to adjust the state of `t` to determine if the loop should execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was used to control the number of iterations, and since the loop continued for three iterations, `t` must have been set to 3 initially.

Given that the loop has already completed three iterations, `t` should now be 0 to indicate that there are no more iterations left.

State: **`m` is 16, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 0**
