State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, _ is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the `range(t)` function to iterate `t` times. It is a convention to use `_` when the loop variable is not needed inside the loop body.
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer within the specified range (1 to 5 ⋅ 10^4).
- Since `_` is just a placeholder and not a state that can be adjusted, we focus on `t`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is within the required range, and `_` is implicitly set to 1 at the start of the first iteration.
