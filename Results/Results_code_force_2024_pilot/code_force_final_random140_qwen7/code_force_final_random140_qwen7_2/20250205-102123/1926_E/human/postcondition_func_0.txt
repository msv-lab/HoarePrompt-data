The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, and k. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the values of n and k. If k is less than or equal to half of n+1, it calculates the output using a specific formula involving m, which is initially set to 1. If k exceeds half of n+1, it adjusts s and n accordingly before calculating the output. The final printed value depends on the adjusted values of n, k, and s.
