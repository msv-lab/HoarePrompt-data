You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `n_back` is initialized to `n`.
   - `s` is set to `(n + 1) // 2`, which counts the number of odd-numbered cards.
   - `n` is also set to `(n + 1) // 2`, representing the number of odd-numbered cards.
   - `m` is initialized to `1`.

3. **Loop to Determine the Position:**
   - The loop continues while `s < k`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `n` becomes zero, it resets `s` to `n_back` and sets `n` to `1`.
     - Multiplies `m` by `2` and divides `n` by `2`.
     - Adds `n` to `s` to count the number of cards that are multiples of `m`.

4. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - After exiting the loop, the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m` is used to calculate the k-th card.

### Verification of Logic

1. **Odd-Numbered Cards:**
   - The initial `s` and `n` correctly represent the number of odd-numbered cards.
   - When `m` is `1`, the formula should return the k-th odd-numbered card.

2. **Multiples of Even Numbers:**
   - The loop increments `m` by multiplying it by `2` and adjusts `n` accordingly.
   - The logic for counting the number of cards that are multiples of `m` seems correct.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m` should correctly compute the k-th card after accounting for the previous groups of cards.
