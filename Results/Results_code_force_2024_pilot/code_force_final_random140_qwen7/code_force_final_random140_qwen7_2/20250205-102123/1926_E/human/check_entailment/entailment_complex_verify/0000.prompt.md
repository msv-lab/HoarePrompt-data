You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:

    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())

        s = (n + 1) // 2
        n = (n + 1) // 2

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        n_back = n
        
        s = (n + 1) // 2
        
        n = (n + 1) // 2
        
        m = 1
        
        while s < k:
            if n == 0:
                s = n_back
                n = 1
                break
            m *= 2
            n //= 2
            s += n
        
        print((2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m)
        
    #State: `m` is 16, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `n_back` is equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, and k. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the values of n and k. If k is less than or equal to half of n+1, it calculates the output using a specific formula involving m, which is initially set to 1. If k exceeds half of n+1, it adjusts s and n accordingly before calculating the output. The final printed value depends on the adjusted values of n, k, and s.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described process for laying down the cards. Specifically, the program does not handle the correct sequence of laying down cards as described. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue.

### Example Analysis

Given `n = 7` and `k = 1`, the expected output is `1`. According to the problem description, the sequence of laying down cards should be as follows:

1. Lay down all odd-numbered cards: 1, 3, 5, 7.
2. Lay down all cards that are twice an odd number: 2, 6.
3. Lay down all cards that are three times an odd number: 4, 10 (but since 10 > 7, it is not included).
4. Lay down all cards that are four times an odd number: 6 (already laid down), 12 (not included).

So, the sequence should be: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4. The first card laid down is 1, which matches the expected output.

However, the provided program does not correctly generate this sequence. Instead, it uses a different approach to calculate the position of the k-th card, which does not follow the described process. For instance, the program calculates `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m`, which does not accurately reflect the described sequence of laying down cards.

To confirm the issue, let's run the program with the provided example:

```plaintext
Input:
7 1

Output:
1
```

This output is correct, but if we test another case, such as `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the expected output is `3`, but the program might produce an incorrect result due to its flawed logic.

Since the program does not correctly follow the described process for all potential cases, the correctness is **False**.
