Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ls` is a list of strings without its last element.
- `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`.
- `other` is the second largest integer value in the original `ls`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(last + other)`.

1. **`last`**: This is the integer value of the last element of the original list `ls`. Since `ls` is a list of strings without its last element, the last element of the original list `ls` is the last string in `ls` converted to an integer.

2. **`other`**: This is the second largest integer value in the original list `ls`. To find this, we would need to convert all strings in `ls` to integers and then find the second largest value among them.

Since the exact content of `ls` is not specified, we can only describe the expression `last + other` in terms of these variables.

Output: **last + other (where last is the integer value of the last element of the original ls and other is the second largest integer value in the original ls)**
