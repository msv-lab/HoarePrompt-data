Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ls` is a list of strings with one less element.
- `last` is the last element of the original `ls` converted to an integer.
- `other` is the second largest element in the original list `ls` converted to an integer.

The print statement is `print(last + other)`. 

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the values of `last` and `other`.

- `last` is the last element of the original `ls` converted to an integer.
- `other` is the second largest element in the original list `ls` converted to an integer.

Since the exact content of `ls` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `last` and `other`. However, we know they are derived from the list `ls`.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the last element and the second largest element of the original list `ls`, both converted to integers.

Output: **last + other (where last is the last element of the original ls converted to an integer and other is the second largest element in the original ls converted to an integer)**
