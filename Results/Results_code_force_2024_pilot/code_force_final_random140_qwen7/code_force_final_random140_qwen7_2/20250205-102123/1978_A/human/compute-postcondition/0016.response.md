Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input split from the input string, `ls` is a list of strings without the last element, `last` is the last element of the original `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the original list `ls` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `last = int(ls.pop())` removes and returns the last element of the list `ls`. This element is then converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `last`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ls` is updated to be a list without its last element, while `last` now holds the integer value of the removed element.
