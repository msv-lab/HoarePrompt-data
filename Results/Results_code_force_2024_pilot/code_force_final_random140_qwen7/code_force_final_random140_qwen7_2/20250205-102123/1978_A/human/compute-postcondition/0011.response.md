Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings with one less element, `last` is the last element of the original `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the original list `ls` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `ls` and removes the largest element (which is stored in `last`). The variable `other` is then assigned the second largest element in the sorted list, which is the largest remaining element in the original list before sorting. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `ls`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
