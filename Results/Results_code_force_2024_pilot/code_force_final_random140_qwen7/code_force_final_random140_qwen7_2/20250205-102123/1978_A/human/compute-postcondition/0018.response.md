Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is the integer input split from the input string.
   - `ls` is a list of strings without the last element.
   - `last` is the last element of the original `ls` converted to an integer.
   - `other` is the second largest element in the original list `ls` converted to an integer and sorted, then popped.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(last + other)
   ```

To determine the output, we need to understand the values of `last` and `other`.

- **`last`:** This is the last element of the original list `ls` converted to an integer. Since `ls` is a list of strings without the last element, `last` is the last element of the original list `ls` minus one element.

- **`other`:** This is the second largest element in the original list `ls` converted to an integer and sorted, then popped. Sorting the list would place the largest element at the end, and popping it would remove it, leaving the second largest element.

Given these descriptions, let's assume the original list `ls` is `[a1, a2, ..., an]`. After removing the last element, `ls` becomes `[a1, a2, ..., an-1]`. The second largest element in this list is the element just below the largest element.

Thus, `last` is the last element of the modified list, and `other` is the second largest element of the original list.

Output: **last + other (where last is the last element of the original list `ls` converted to an integer, and other is the second largest element of the original list `ls` converted to an integer)**
