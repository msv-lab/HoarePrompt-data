Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `ls = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `ls`. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `n` remains as an input integer, but now `ls` holds the split input as a list of strings.
