Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input split from the input string, `ls` is a list of strings without the last element, `last` is the last element of the original `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the original list `ls` converted to an integer and sorted, then popped.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `ls` and removes the largest element (since `.pop()` removes the last element of the sorted list, which is the largest), leaving `other` as the second largest element in the original list `ls`. All other variables remain unchanged.
