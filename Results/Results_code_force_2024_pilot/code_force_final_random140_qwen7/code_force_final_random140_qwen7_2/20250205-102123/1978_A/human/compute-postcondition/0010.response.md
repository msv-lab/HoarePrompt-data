Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings with one less element, and `last` is the last element of the original `ls` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `last = int(ls.pop())` removes and returns the last element of the list `ls`. This element is then converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `last`. The length of `ls` is reduced by one because `pop()` removes the last element. All other variables remain unchanged.
