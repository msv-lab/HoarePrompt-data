Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop head).
   - `ls` is a list of strings without its last element.
   - `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`.
   - `other` is the second largest integer value in the original `ls`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - Since `i` is now 1, `t` must remain the same for the loop to continue.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n`, `ls`, `last`, and `other` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1**.
