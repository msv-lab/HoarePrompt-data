Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (number of books), and a list of \( n \) integers representing the number of pages in each book. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the largest and second-largest page counts.**
