Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings without the last element, and `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`.**

Explanation: The code `last = int(ls.pop())` removes the last element from the list `ls` and converts it to an integer, storing it in the variable `last`. The initial state of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `ls` remains unchanged except that `ls` now has one less element, and `last` holds the integer value of the removed element.
