Reasoning:
The provided function `func()` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input**: The function reads the input but does not properly handle the list of book pages. Specifically, it uses `input().split()` which splits the input string into a list of strings, but it then incorrectly pops elements from this list without sorting it first. This approach does not ensure that the largest and second-largest values are correctly identified.

2. **Sorting and Popping**: The function sorts the list `ls` after popping the last element. However, the pop operation removes the last element, and the sort operation reorders the remaining elements. This means that the second-largest element might not be the second-largest in the original list.

3. **Logic Error**: The logic should involve finding the largest and second-largest elements in the list of book pages, not just relying on the order after some elements have been removed and sorted.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly identify the largest and second-largest elements for each test case, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
