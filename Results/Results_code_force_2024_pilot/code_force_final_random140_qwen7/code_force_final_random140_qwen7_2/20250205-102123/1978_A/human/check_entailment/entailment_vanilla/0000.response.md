### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Alice needs to divide the books into two piles such that the sum of the highest-numbered book in each pile is maximized.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of book page counts.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and a list of book page counts.
   - It then processes the list by removing the last element (`last`) and sorting the remaining elements to get the largest possible value (`other`).
   - Finally, it prints the sum of `last` and `other`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The approach of taking the last element and the largest remaining element after sorting is flawed because:
     - Sorting the entire list and then taking the last two elements does not guarantee that the highest-numbered book in each pile is selected.
     - The goal is to maximize the sum of the highest-numbered book in each pile, not just the largest values.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this correctly, we need to:
     - Identify the highest-numbered book in the list.
     - Ensure the highest-numbered book is split between the two piles.
     - Maximize the sum of the highest-numbered book in each pile.

5. **Testing with Examples**:
   - For the example test case 2: `4 2 3 3 1`, the correct solution should consider splitting the books such that the highest-numbered books are optimally placed.
   - The correct answer should be 4, achieved by putting books 3 and 4 in one pile and books 1 and 2 in another pile.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as intended. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
