You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = input().split()
        last = int(ls.pop())
        other = int(sorted(ls).pop())
        print(last + other)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (number of books), and a list of \( n \) integers representing the number of pages in each book. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the largest and second-largest page counts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Reading Number of Books:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n`.

3. **Reading Pages of Books:**
   - It reads the pages of the books as a list of strings.
   - The last element of this list (`last`) is removed and converted to an integer.
   - The remaining elements are sorted, and the largest element (`other`) is selected and converted to an integer.

4. **Calculating Result:**
   - The program calculates the sum of `last` and `other` and prints it.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Handling of Input:**
   - The program assumes that the last element in the list of book pages is the largest and the second-largest element is the second-to-last element after sorting.
   - This assumption is not always correct because the list might not be sorted in descending order initially, and the last element might not necessarily be the largest.

2. **Sorting and Picking Elements:**
   - The program sorts the list of book pages and picks the largest and second-largest elements directly from the sorted list.
   - This approach fails when the input list is not already sorted in descending order.

### Example Counter-Example

Consider the following input:
```
2
4
3 2 1 4
5
5 4 3 2 1
```

- For the first test case:
  - The list is `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.
  - After removing the last element (`4`), the list becomes `[3, 2, 1]`.
  - Sorting the list gives `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - The largest element (`3`) and the second-largest element (`2`) are picked.
  - The result printed is `3 + 2 = 5`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `4 + 3 = 7`.

- For the second test case:
  - The list is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
  - After removing the last element (`1`), the list becomes `[5, 4, 3, 2]`.
  - Sorting the list gives `[2, 3, 4, 5]`.
  - The largest element (`5`) and the second-largest element (`4`) are picked.
  - The result printed is `5 + 4 = 9`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `5 + 3 = 8`.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the largest and second-largest elements in the list of book pages. It relies on the order of elements after sorting, which may not be the correct order.
