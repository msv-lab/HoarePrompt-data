Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `s` is 4, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to it. Given the initial value of `s` is 2, we calculate `s // (k - 1) + 1`. Since `k` is between 2 and 30, `(k - 1)` is between 1 and 29. In the worst case (when `k` is 2), `s // (k - 1) + 1` equals `2 // 1 + 1 = 3`. Thus, `s` becomes `2 + 3 = 4`. The other variables remain unchanged.
