Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < x`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5 and `x` must be greater than 4.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 5, for the loop to continue, `x` must be greater than 5.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 6.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `x` must be greater than 5.
- `i` will be 6.

The final state is:
**`x` must be greater than 5, `i` is 6**.
