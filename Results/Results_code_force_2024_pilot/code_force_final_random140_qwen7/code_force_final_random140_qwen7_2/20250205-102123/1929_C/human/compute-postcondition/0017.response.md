Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 4.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `x` must be greater than 4.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from the previous value, so `i` will be 5.
   - `s` remains unchanged from the previous state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`x` must be greater than 4, `i` is 5, `s` is `s` + `s // (k - 1) + 1**
