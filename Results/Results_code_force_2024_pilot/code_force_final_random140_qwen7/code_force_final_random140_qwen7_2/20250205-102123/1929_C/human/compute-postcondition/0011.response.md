Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\).
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
- `s` is initially 8.
- `i` is initially 3.
- `x` must be greater than 1 but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.

The loop updates `s` according to the rule `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for 3 iterations. Given that after 3 iterations, `s` has been incremented from its initial value of 1 to 8, we can infer that the loop was not executed because `s` starts at 8 and does not change further within the loop context provided.

The print statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".

Since `s` is 8 and `a` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), the print statement will evaluate `a >= 8`.

Output: **YES**
