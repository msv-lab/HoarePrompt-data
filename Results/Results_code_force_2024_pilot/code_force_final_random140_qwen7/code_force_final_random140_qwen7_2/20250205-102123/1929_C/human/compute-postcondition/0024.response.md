To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` must be greater than or equal to 5.
   - `i` is 5.
   - `s` is calculated as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1` after 3 iterations.

2. **Operations:**
   - The loop runs 3 times, updating `s` each time according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

Let's assume `k` is a constant or a known value. Since `k` is not explicitly given, we'll consider a general case where `k` is a positive integer greater than 1 (as `k - 1` must be positive).

### Iteration Analysis:
- **First Iteration:**
  - Let's assume `s` starts as 1 (a common starting point for such problems).
  - `s = 1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`
  - If `k = 2`, then `s = 1 + 1 // 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
  - If `k = 3`, then `s = 1 + 1 // 2 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.
  - For simplicity, let's assume `k = 2` (common in such problems), so `s = 3`.

- **Second Iteration:**
  - `s = 3 + 3 // (k - 1) + 1`
  - If `k = 2`, then `s = 3 + 3 // 1 + 1 = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7`.

- **Third Iteration:**
  - `s = 7 + 7 // (k - 1) + 1`
  - If `k = 2`, then `s = 7 + 7 // 1 + 1 = 7 + 7 + 1 = 15`.

So, after 3 iterations, `s` will be 15.

### Final Values:
- `x` is at least 5.
- `i` is 5.
- `s` is 15.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')
```

Since `s` is 15 and `a` is not specified but must be compared with `s`, and since `x` is at least 5, we need to know the value of `a`. Without loss of generality, if `a` is at least 15 (or any value greater than or equal to 15), the condition `a >= s` will be true.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
