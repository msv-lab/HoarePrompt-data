Output State: **`x` must be greater than 4, `i` is 5, `s` is 2 * `s // (k - 1) + 1**.

Explanation: The initial state includes `x` being greater than 4, `i` being 5, and `s` being `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`. The code snippet updates `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we keep it as `k`. The updated value of `s` is now `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * s // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
