Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `s` is 8, `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 1.

Explanation: The loop increments `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration. Starting from `s = 1`, after the first iteration, `s` becomes 2. After the second iteration, `s` becomes 4. After the third iteration, `s` becomes 6. Following the pattern, after the fourth iteration, `s` will be `6 // (k - 1) + 1 = 6 // (k - 1) + 1`. Given the constraints on `k`, the minimum value of `s` after the fourth iteration is 8 when `k` is at its minimum value of 2. The variable `i` increments by 1 with each iteration, so after 4 iterations, `i` will be 3. The condition `x > 1` must hold for the loop to continue executing, so `x` must be greater than 1.
