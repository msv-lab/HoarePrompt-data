Output State: **`i` is 30, `x` must be greater than or equal to 31, `s` is 1073741824, `k`, `t`, and `a` are assigned values from the input split into integers.**

Explanation: 
- The loop continues as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 31 (since after 30 iterations, `i` will reach 30).
- Each iteration updates `s` according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
- Starting from `s = 1`, after 30 iterations, `s` will be significantly large due to the exponential growth pattern of the formula.
- `i` will be 30 because it increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
- `x` must be at least 31 to allow the loop to run 30 times.
- `k`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
