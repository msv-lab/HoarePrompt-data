Output State: **`k` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `s` is updated to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. However, since the initial state specifies that `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, their values do not change. The variable `s` is updated according to the formula `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, and `i` is incremented to 4. Therefore, the output state includes these updates while keeping the unchanged variables as they were.
