Output State: **`x` must be greater than 5, `i` is 5, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. However, since `k` is not defined in the initial state or within the given code snippet, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `s`. Therefore, the updated value of `s` is expressed as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`. The conditions and values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged.
