Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9; `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

This means that the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` have been updated to the integers provided by the user input, while the constraints for `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.
