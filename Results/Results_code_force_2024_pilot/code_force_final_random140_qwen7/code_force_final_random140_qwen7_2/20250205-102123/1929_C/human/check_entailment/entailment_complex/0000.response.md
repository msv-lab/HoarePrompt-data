Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).
3. It then calculates a value \( s \) using the formula \( s = 1 \)
   \[
   \text{for } i \text{ in range}(x): \\
   s += s // (k - 1) + 1
   \]
   This loop essentially simulates Sasha's betting strategy where he starts with 1 coin and increases his bet after a loss, ensuring he doesn't lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
4. The function then checks if Sasha's initial amount of coins \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( s \). If so, it prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can achieve his goal; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
5. The logic in the loop and the final check appear to be correct based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the analysis, the function appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
