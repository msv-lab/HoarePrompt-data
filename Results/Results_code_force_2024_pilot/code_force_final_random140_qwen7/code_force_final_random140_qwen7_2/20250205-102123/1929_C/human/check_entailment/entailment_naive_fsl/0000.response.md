Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the strategy for Sasha to ensure he can achieve any number of coins. Specifically, the program calculates `s` based on the number of consecutive losses `x`, but it does not account for the varying bet amounts and the possibility of winning after a series of losses.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 3 15`
- Expected Output: `YES`

However, the program's logic does not guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins. For instance, if Sasha starts with 15 coins and the rules are as follows:
- `k = 2`: Bet amount doubles on win.
- `x = 3`: Maximum 3 consecutive losses.

The program calculates `s` as:
\[ s = 1 + \frac{1}{2-1} + 1 = 3 \]

This calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the varying bet amounts and the need to recover from losses. Sasha needs a strategy that ensures he can always increase his coin count, which the current implementation does not provide.

A correct approach would involve a dynamic programming or recursive strategy to ensure Sasha can always recover from losses and eventually achieve any desired number of coins. The current implementation fails to meet this requirement.
