Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the first element of `lit` followed by any elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding element, and `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are less than or equal to their preceding element; `s` will be the total count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element.

In this final state, `i` will have reached `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The list `a` will consist of the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than their immediate predecessor. The list `b` will include all elements from `lit` that are less than or equal to their immediate predecessor. The variable `s` will hold the cumulative count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element during the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is a non-empty list, and if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. There is no change in `s` if the condition `b[i] > b[i - 1]` is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is a non-empty list, and `s` is 2 if `b[2] > b[1]` is true; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `b` is a non-empty list, and `s` is 1. If the element at index `i` in list `b` is greater than the element at index `i - 1`, then the value of `s` remains 1. If the condition is not met, `s` still remains 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
