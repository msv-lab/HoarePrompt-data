Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(b)`, `s` is the total count of elements in list `b` where an element is greater than its preceding element, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `n`. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
