Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the last element of `a` is now equal to `lit[i]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is `k-1`, the last element of `a` before appending is `lit[k-1]`. After appending, the last element of `a` becomes `lit[i]`, which is `lit[k-1]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
