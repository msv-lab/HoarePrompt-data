Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers where the last element of `a` is less than the element at index 1 in the list `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the element at index 1 from the list `lit`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 1) from the list `lit` to the list `b`. Since `i` was 1 before the operation, `b` now contains the element at index 1 from `lit`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
