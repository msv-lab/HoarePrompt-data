Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the first element of `lit` followed by any elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding element, and `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are less than or equal to their preceding element; `s` will be the total count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element.

This means that after processing all inputs, `a` will store the increasing subsequence found in `lit`, and `b` will store the non-increasing subsequence. The variable `s` will hold the total count of elements in `a` that form an increasing sequence with their preceding elements.
