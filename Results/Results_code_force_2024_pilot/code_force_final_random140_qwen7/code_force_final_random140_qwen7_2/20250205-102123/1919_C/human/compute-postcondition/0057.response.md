Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `s` is `k-1`, `len(b)` is `k`, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The other variables (`i`, `s`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
