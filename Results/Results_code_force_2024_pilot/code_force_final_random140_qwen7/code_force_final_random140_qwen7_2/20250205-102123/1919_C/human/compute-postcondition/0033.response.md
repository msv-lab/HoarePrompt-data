Postcondition: `i` is 2, `a` must contain at least one element, and `s` is 2. If the element at index `i` in array `a` is greater than the element at index `i-1`, then the postcondition remains as specified. If the element at index `i` is not greater than the element at index `i-1`, the postcondition also remains as specified since there is no else part to modify the state.
