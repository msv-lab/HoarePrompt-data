Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `cp` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values and states.
