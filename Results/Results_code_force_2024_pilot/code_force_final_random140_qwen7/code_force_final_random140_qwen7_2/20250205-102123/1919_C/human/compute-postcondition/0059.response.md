Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `s` is `k-1`, `len(b)` is 0, `a` is `[lit[0]]`, `b` is `[]**.

Explanation: The code initializes `a` as a list containing the first element of `lit` (which is `lit[0]`) and `b` as an empty list. The lengths of `b` and the values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
