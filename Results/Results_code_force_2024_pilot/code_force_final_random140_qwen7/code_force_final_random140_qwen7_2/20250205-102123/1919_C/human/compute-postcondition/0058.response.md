Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `s` is `k-1`, `len(b)` is `k`, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `lit`. The values of `i`, `s`, and `len(b)` remain unchanged from their initial state.
