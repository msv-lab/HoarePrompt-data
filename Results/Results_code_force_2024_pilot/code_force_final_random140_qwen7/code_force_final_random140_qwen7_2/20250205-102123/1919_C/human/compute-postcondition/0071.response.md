Output State: **`i` is `k`, `n` must be greater than `1`, and the last element of `a` is now equal to `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was previously either less than or equal to `lit[i]`, after appending `lit[i]` to `a`, the last element of `a` is now exactly `lit[i]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
