Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being `1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[1, len(a))`.

3. **Consider the Final State of `i`:**
   - After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`.

4. **Check the State of Other Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` are constructed based on the initial list `lit` but are not directly adjusted in the loop head.
   - `s` is not involved in the loop head and remains `0`.

5. **Ensure the List `a` and `b` are Correctly Initialized:**
   - `a` should contain the first element of `lit` followed by any elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding element.
   - `b` should contain all elements from `lit` that are less than or equal to their preceding element.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the initial value of `i` and the conditions under which the loop can start. Since `i` starts at `1` and the loop continues as long as `i < len(a)`, we need to ensure that `len(a)` is at least `2` (since `i` starts at `1`).

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: `i` is 1, `len(a)` must be at least 2**
