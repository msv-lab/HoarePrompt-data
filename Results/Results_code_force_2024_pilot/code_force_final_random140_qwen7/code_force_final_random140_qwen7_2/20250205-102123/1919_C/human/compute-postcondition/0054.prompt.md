Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `a` will be a list starting with the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `s` will be the count of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element, and `b` will be empty since no elements less than the last element of `a` were added during the loop's iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `s` is 1, `len(b)` is at least 2, and if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then the condition holds true. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, the condition does not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `s` is 2, `len(b)` is at least 3, and if `b[2]` is greater than `b[1]`, then the values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `s` is 3, `len(b)` is at least 3, and if `b[3]` is greater than `b[2]`, then the values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
