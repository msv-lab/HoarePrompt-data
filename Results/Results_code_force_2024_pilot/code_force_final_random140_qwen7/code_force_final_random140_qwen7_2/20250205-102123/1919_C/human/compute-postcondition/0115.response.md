Output State: **`a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is the total count of elements in list `b` where an element is greater than its preceding element, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code initializes `a` as a list containing the first element of `lit` and `b` as an empty list. The values of `s`, `n`, and `lit` remain unchanged from their initial state.
