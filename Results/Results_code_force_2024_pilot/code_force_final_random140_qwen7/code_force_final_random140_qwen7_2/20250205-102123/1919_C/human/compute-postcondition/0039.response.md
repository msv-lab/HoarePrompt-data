Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `a` will be a list starting with the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `s` will be the count of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element, and `b` will be empty since no elements less than the last element of `a` were added during the loop's iterations.**

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will be set to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of the final list `a`). The list `a` will start with the first element of `lit` and then include all subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`. The variable `s` will hold the count of how many times an element in `a` was found to be greater than the preceding element. Since the loop only adds elements to `a` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, and there is no condition to add elements to `b`, `b` will remain empty.
