Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially `k-1`.
   - `n` is not explicitly given, but it is used as the upper bound for the range function.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n > 1` and `i` is within the range from 1 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is `k-1`, we need to ensure that `i` falls within the range of the loop, i.e., `1 <= k-1 < n`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `s` is `k-1`, but since it is not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `len(b)` is 0, but this is not relevant to the loop head.
   - `a` is `[lit[0]]`, but this is not part of the loop head.
   - `b` is `[]`, but this is not part of the loop head.
   - `cp` is 0, but this is not part of the loop head.

Given the above analysis, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `i` should be `k-1` (as given).
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is `k-1`, `n` must be greater than 1**
