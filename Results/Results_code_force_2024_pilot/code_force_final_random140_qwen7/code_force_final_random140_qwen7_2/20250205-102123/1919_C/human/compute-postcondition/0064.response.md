Output State: **`b` now contains the element `lit[i]`, `i` is `k-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` of `lit` to the list `b`. Since `i` is `k-1`, the element appended to `b` is `lit[k-1]`. The other conditions and the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
