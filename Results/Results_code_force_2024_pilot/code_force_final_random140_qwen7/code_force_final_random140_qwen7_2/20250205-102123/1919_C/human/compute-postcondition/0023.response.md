Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` will contain the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, and `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a` if they were added during the loop's iterations.**

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times. The list `a` will contain the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`. Similarly, the list `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that were added to it because they were less than the last element of `a` during the loop's iterations. The variable `n` and the initial value of `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
