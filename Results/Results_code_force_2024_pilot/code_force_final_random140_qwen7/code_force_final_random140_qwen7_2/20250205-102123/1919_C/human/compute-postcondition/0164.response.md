Output State: **`i` is 3, `b` is a non-empty list, and `s` is 1**

Explanation: The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Given that `s` was initially unchanged from its initial state (implying it was 0), after executing the code, `s` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
