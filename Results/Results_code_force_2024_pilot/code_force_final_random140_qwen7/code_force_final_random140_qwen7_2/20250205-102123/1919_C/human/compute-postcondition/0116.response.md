Output State: **`a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is the total count of elements in list `b` where an element is greater than its preceding element, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `cp` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cp` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, `n`, or `lit`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
