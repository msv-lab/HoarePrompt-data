Output State: **`i` is `k`, `n` must be greater than `1`, and the last element of `a` is now equal to `lit[i]`; `b` contains the element `lit[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given the precondition, the last element of `a` is either less than or equal to `lit[i]`. If the last element of `a` is less than `lit[i]`, then `b` contains the element `lit[i]`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is equal to `lit[i]`. Since the code simply appends `lit[i]` to `b`, and given the conditions, the last element of `a` is now equal to `lit[i]`, and `b` contains `lit[i]`.
