Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3; `a` contains the element `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `lit[i]` will be the element at index 2 or 3 in the list `lit`. The initial state of `i` being 2 or 3 and `n` being greater than 1 remains unchanged.
