Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(b)`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(b)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `s` is 1 (not directly involved in the loop condition)
   - `len(b)` is at least 2
   - The condition `b[i] > b[i - 1]` holds true if `b[1] > b[0]`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1 = 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(b)`. Given that `len(b)` is at least 2, `i` being 2 is valid as long as `len(b)` is at least 3.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `len(b)` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop condition.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `s` is 1, `len(b)` is at least 3**
