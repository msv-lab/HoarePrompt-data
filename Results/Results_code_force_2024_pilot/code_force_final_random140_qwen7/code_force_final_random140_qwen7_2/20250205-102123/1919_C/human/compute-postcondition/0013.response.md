Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 or 2, and `n` is greater than 1.

4. **Analyze the loop increment**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, if `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2. If `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.

5. **Check the loop termination condition**: The loop will terminate when `i` becomes `n`. Given that `n` is greater than 1, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state such that `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was 1, it will become 2. If `i` was 2, it will become 3.

7. **Ensure `n` remains unchanged**: The value of `n` should remain the same since the loop does not modify `n`.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is greater than 1**
