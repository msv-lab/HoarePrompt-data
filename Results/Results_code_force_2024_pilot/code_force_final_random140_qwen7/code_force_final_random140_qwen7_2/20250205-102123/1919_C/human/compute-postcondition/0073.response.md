Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the initial values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k`, and `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now `k + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1**
