Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index 1 in the list `lit`, then `b` contains the element at index 1 from the list `lit`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is equal to `lit[i]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i` as 1 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is no longer less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - After the first iteration where `i` is 1, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **New State Calculation:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `i` will now be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

6. **Post-Condition:**
   - The post-condition remains the same because the loop body is omitted, and the conditions for `b` and `a` are not directly modified by the loop itself.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
