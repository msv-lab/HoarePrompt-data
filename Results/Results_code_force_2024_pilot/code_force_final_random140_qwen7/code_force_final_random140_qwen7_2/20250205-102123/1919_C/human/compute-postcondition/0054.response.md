Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `s` is `n-1`, `len(b)` is `n`, and `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: Given the conditions provided, the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`. During each iteration, the value of `s` is incremented if the current element in `b` is greater than the previous one. Since the loop stops when `i` reaches `n-1`, `s` will also be `n-1` because there are `n-1` comparisons made. The list `b` remains empty as per the initial description and the loop logic does not add any elements to it.
