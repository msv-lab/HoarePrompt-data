Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` contains the element `lit[2]`**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 2, `a` will now contain the element `lit[2]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
