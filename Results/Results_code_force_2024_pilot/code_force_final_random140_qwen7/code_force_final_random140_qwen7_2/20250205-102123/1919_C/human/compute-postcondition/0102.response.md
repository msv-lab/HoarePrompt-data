Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `len(b)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is within the range of `1` to `len(b)`.
   - `len(b)` must be at least `1`.
   - If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be within the range `1` to `len(b)`.
   - Therefore, `len(b)` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration, and `i` must be such that `i + 1` is within the valid range.

Given that `i` was within the range `1` to `len(b)` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be `len(b) - 1` (the maximum value `i` could have before the next increment would take it out of the range).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
- `len(b)` must be at least `2` (since `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `len(b) - 1`).

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is `len(b) - 1`, `len(b)` must be at least 2**
