Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the first element of `lit` followed by any elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding element, and `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are less than or equal to their preceding element; `s` will be the total count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element.

In simpler terms, `i` will be the length of `lit`, `a` will be a list starting with the first element of `lit` and including subsequent elements from `lit` that are strictly increasing, `b` will include all other elements from `lit`, and `s` will count how many elements in `a` are greater than the element before them.
