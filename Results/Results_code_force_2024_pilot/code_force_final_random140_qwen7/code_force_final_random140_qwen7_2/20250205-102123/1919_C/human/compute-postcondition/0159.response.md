Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the loop, it's part of the initial state).
   - `b` is a non-empty list.
   - `s` is 1 if `b[i] > b[i-1]` was true in the previous iteration; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(b)`.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `2`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - Since `b` is a non-empty list, `len(b)` is at least 1. Given that `i` is now 2, the condition `i < len(b)` must hold true for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 1 (though it doesn't affect the loop directly).
   - `b` remains a non-empty list.
   - `s` remains unchanged unless `b[2] > b[1]` is true in the next iteration.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is a non-empty list, and `s` is 1 if `b[2] > b[1]` was true in the previous iteration; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
