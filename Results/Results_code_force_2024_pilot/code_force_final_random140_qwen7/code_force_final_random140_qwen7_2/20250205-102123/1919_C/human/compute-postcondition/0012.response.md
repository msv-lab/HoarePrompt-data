Postcondition: `i` is 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers. If `a[-1]` was less than `lit[i]` (when `i` is 2), then the last element of `a` remains unchanged and `a` contains the element at index 1. If `a[-1]` is now greater than or equal to `lit[i]` (when `i` is 1), then `a` has an additional element which is `lit[i]`, and the last element of `a` is `lit[i]`.
