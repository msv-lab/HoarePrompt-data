You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5. The array c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, and for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`.
    #
    #This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n+1`. The `sum` list will have its last element as the sum of all elements in the `nums` list, since it accumulates the sum of `nums[i-1]` at each iteration. Similarly, the `ones` list will have its last element as the count of `1`s in the `nums` list up to the last index, since it increments by 1 whenever `nums[i-1]` is `1`.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`, `l` and `r` are undefined, `sumInRange` and `onesInRange` are undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it takes parameters n (number of elements in the array), q (number of queries), an array c (a list of n positive integers), and for each query, l_i and r_i (integers indicating the range of the query). It returns the results of the queries based on the specified ranges in the array c.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
