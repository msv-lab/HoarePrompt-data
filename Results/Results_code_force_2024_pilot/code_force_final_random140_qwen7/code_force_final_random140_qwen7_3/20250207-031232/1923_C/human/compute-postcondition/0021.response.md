Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`**.

This means that the variable `onesInRange` has been calculated as the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous states.
