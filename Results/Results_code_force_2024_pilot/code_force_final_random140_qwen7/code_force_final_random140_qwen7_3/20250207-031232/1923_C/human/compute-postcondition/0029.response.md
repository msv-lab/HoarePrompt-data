Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is a positive integer - 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers separated by a space from the input.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))` reads two integers separated by a space from the input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
