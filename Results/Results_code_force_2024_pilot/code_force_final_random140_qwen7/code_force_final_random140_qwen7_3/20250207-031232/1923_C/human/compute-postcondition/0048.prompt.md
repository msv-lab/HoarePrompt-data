Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n+1`. The `sum` list will have its last element as the sum of all elements in the `nums` list, since it accumulates the sum of `nums[i-1]` at each iteration. Similarly, the `ones` list will have its last element as the count of `1`s in the `nums` list up to the last index, since it increments by 1 whenever `nums[i-1]` is `1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`. If the condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange)` is satisfied, then no changes are made. Otherwise, the condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange)` is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is a positive integer - 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`, `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers separated by a space from the input, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is a positive integer - 2, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`, `l` and `r` are two integers from the input, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, and after executing the if-else block, if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, then no further changes are made to `sumInRange` and `onesInRange`. Otherwise, `sumInRange` and `onesInRange` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
