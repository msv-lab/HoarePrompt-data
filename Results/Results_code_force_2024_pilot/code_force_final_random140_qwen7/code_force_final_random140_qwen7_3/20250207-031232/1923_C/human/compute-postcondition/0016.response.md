Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer.**

The code `l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. Since the initial values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `sum[n]`, and `ones[n-1]` are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged. The new variables `l` and `r` are assigned the values of the two integers input by the user.
