Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros where each element is 0, `i` is 3, `sum[2]` is `sum[1] + nums[1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum[i]` to `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]`. Initially, `i` is 2, so the code sets `sum[2]` to `sum[1] + nums[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
