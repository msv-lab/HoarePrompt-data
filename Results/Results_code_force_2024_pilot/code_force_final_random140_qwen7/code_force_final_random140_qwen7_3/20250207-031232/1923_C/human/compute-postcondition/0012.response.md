Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros where each element is 0, `i` is 9, `sum[9]` is `sum[8]` + `nums[8]`, `ones[7]` is `ones[6]` + (1 if `nums[6]` == 1 else 0)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum[9]` to be `sum[8] + nums[8]`. The value of `i` is updated to 9 because the index used in the assignment is `i - 1`, and `i` was initially 8. The value of `ones[7]` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. All other variables retain their initial states.
