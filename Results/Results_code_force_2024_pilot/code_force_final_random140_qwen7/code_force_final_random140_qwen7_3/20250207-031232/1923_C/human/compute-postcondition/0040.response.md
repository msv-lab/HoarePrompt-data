Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `q` is a positive integer - 2, so `q = n - 2`.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers initialized to zero.
- `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers initialized to zero.
- `i` is set to `n+1`.
- `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`.
- `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`.
- `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers separated by a space from the input.
- `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
