Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `q` is a positive integer - 1, so `q = n - 1`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers initialized to zero.
   - `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers initialized to zero.
   - `i` is set to `n + 1`.
   - `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`.
   - `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`.
   - `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers separated by a space from the input.
   - `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
   - `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

Given this information, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
