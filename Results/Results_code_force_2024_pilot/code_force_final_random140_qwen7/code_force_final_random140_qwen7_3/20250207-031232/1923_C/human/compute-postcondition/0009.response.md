Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros where each element is 0, `i` is 6, `sum[6]` is `sum[5] + nums[5]`, `ones[5]` is `ones[4] + (1 if nums[4] == 1 else 0)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `i` to 6 and calculates `sum[6]` as `sum[5] + nums[5]`. The value of `ones[5]` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. All other variables retain their initial states.
