Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to variables `n` and `q`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer. The values of `n` and `q` are now specific input integers.
