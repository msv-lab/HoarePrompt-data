Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (unchanged).
   - `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
   - `q` is an input integer (unchanged).
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces (unchanged).
   - `ones` is a list of `n + 1` zeros (unchanged).
   - `sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each element is 0 (unchanged).
   - `i` is 3 (this will change in the next iteration).
   - `sum[2]` is `sum[1] + nums[1]` (this will change based on the new value of `i`).

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop starts from 1 and increments by 1, the next value of `i` will be 4.

5. **Determine the state of `sum` for the next iteration**: 
   - The current value of `sum[2]` is `sum[1] + nums[1]`.
   - For the next iteration, `sum[3]` will be calculated as `sum[2] + nums[2]`.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `sum[3]` will be `sum[2] + nums[2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros where each element is 0, `i` is 4, `sum[3]` is `sum[2] + nums[2]`**
