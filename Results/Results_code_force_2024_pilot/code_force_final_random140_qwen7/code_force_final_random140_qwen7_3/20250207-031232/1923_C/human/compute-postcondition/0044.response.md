Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is a positive integer - 2, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`, `l` and `r` are two integers from the input, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is calculated and stored.**

Explanation: The code simply calculates `sumInRange` which is already defined as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. This calculation does not change any of the existing variables or their relationships. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except that `sumInRange` now holds the value of `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
