Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it takes parameters n (number of elements in the array), q (number of queries), an array c (a list of n positive integers), and for each query, l_i and r_i (integers indicating the range of the query). It returns the results of the queries based on the specified ranges in the array c.**
