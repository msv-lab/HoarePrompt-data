Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros where each element is 0, `i` is 2, `ones[1]` is the sum of `ones[0]` and 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` is `ones[0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ones[i]` to be the sum of `ones[i-1]` and 1 if `nums[i-1]` is 1, otherwise it remains `ones[i-1]`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `i` is incremented to 2. `ones[1]` is updated based on the value of `nums[0]`. If `nums[0]` is 1, then `ones[1]` becomes `ones[0] + 1`; otherwise, `ones[1]` remains `ones[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
