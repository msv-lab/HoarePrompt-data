Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`, inclusive.
3. **Initial state of `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to `1` because the loop starts with `i = 1`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is set to `1` and `n` is a valid input integer (since `i` will iterate up to `n + 1`).

Here is the state after adjustment:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros where each element is 0, `i` is 1**
