Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros where each element is 0, `i` is 5, `ones[5]` is `ones[4] + (1 if nums[4] == 1 else 0)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ones[i]` to be `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise 0. Given that initially `i` is 4, after executing `i` becomes 5. The value of `ones[5]` is calculated based on the condition given. All other variables remain unchanged.
