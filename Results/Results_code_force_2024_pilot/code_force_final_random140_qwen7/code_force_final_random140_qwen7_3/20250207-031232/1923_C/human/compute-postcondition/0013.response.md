Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `sum[n]` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to index `n-1`, and `ones[n-1]` is the count of 1s in the list `nums` up to index `n-1`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n + 1`, as the loop runs from 1 to `n`. The `sum` list will contain the cumulative sums of the `nums` list, with `sum[n]` being the total sum of all elements in `nums`. Similarly, the `ones` list will contain the count of 1s encountered so far, with `ones[n-1]` representing the total count of 1s in the `nums` list.
