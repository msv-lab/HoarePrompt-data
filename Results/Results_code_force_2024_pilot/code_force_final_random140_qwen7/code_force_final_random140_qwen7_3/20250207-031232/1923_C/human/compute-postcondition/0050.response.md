Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads an array `nums` of `n` positive integers. For each query, it reads the range `l` and `r` and checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is satisfied. If the condition holds, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results of the queries.**
