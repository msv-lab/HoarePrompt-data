Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state provides us with several variables and their relationships but does not give explicit values for them.
- `t` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output.
- `n` is an input integer, but again, its specific value is not required.
- `q` is a positive integer - 1, so `q = n`.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. Its specific content is not needed.
- `ones` and `sum` are both lists of `n+1` integers initialized to zero.
- `i` is set to `n+1`.
- `sum[n]` is calculated as `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`.
- `ones[n-1]` is calculated as `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`.
- `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers separated by a space from the input.
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO', regardless of the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output is **NO**.
