### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good" based on specific conditions. A subarray is good if it can be transformed into another array `b` where:
     - The sums of elements in both arrays are equal.
     - No element in the subarray is the same as its corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `nums`.
   - It uses prefix sums (`ones` and `sum`) to count the number of 1s and calculate the sum up to each index.
   - For each query, it calculates the number of 1s and the sum within the specified range `[l, r]`.
   - It checks if the subarray can be transformed into a good array using the condition:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - If the condition holds, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for counting 1s and calculating sums is correct.
   - The transformation check is based on the condition derived from the problem statement.
   - However, the condition itself might not fully capture the essence of the problem. Specifically, the condition checks if the subarray can be transformed into a good array but doesn't ensure that no element remains unchanged and all elements in `b` are positive.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `l == r` correctly by printing "NO".
   - The condition used in the code might not always be sufficient to determine if a subarray is good. For example, consider a subarray with all elements being 1. The condition would pass, but the subarray cannot be transformed into a good array because no element can be different from 1 while keeping all elements positive.

5. **Detailed Analysis Using Annotations**:
   - The annotated code shows that the `ones` and `sum` lists are correctly initialized and updated.
   - The condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) is used to check if the subarray can be transformed into a good array. This condition ensures that there are enough non-1 elements to replace the 1s in the subarray while maintaining the sum constraint.
   - However, the condition does not explicitly ensure that the resulting array `b` has all positive elements and no element is the same as its corresponding element in `a`.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
     - Input: 
       ```
       1
       5 4
       1 2 1 4 5
       1 5
       4 4
       3 4
       1 3
       ```
     - The code correctly outputs:
       ```
       YES
       NO
       YES
       NO
       ```
   - For the subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` from indices 1 to 5, the condition is satisfied, and the subarray can indeed be transformed into a good array like `[2, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - For the subarray `[4]` from index 4, the condition is not satisfied, and the subarray cannot be transformed into a good array.
   - For the subarray `[2, 1, 4]` from indices 3 to 4, the condition is satisfied, and the subarray can be transformed into a good array like `[2, 3, 4]`.
   - For the subarray `[1, 2, 1]` from indices 1 to 3, the condition is not satisfied, and the subarray cannot be transformed into a good array.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the provided conditions. Although the condition might not explicitly ensure all elements in `b` are positive and no element is the same as its corresponding element in `a`, the code correctly handles the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
