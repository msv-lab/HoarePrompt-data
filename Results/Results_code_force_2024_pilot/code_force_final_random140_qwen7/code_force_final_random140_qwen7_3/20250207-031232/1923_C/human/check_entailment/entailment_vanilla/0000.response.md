### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good" based on specific conditions. A subarray is good if it can be transformed into another array `b` where:
   - The sums of elements in both arrays are equal.
   - No element in the subarray is the same as its corresponding element in `b`.
   - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `nums`.
   - It uses prefix sums (`ones` and `sum`) to count the number of 1s and calculate the sum up to each index.
   - For each query, it calculates the number of 1s and the sum within the specified range `[l, r]`.
   - It checks if the subarray can be transformed into a good array using the condition:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - If the condition holds, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for counting 1s and calculating sums is correct.
   - The transformation check is based on the condition derived from the problem statement.
   - However, the condition itself might not fully capture the essence of the problem. Specifically, the condition checks if the subarray can be transformed into a good array but doesn't ensure that no element remains unchanged and all elements in `b` are positive.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `l == r` correctly by printing "NO".
   - The condition used in the code might not always be sufficient to determine if a subarray is good. For example, consider a subarray with all elements being 1. The condition would pass, but the subarray cannot be transformed into a good array because no element can be different from 1 while keeping all elements positive.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not fully implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem statement. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
