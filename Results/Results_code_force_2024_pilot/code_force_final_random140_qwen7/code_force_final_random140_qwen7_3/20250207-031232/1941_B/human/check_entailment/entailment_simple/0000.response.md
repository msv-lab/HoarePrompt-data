Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1`: This function correctly implements the specified operation and returns the modified array.
   - `func_2`: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero and returns `True` if they are, otherwise `False`.
   - `func_3`: This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the operations defined in `func_1`. It uses a loop to find the highest value in the array and applies the operation until it either makes all elements zero or exhausts 100 iterations.
3. **Logic Flow**:
   - For each test case, `func_3` is called with the array as an argument.
   - If `func_2` returns `True` initially, it immediately appends `'YES'` to `answers`.
   - If not, it iteratively applies the operation to the highest value in the array and checks again with `func_2`.
   - If after 100 iterations, `func_2` still returns `False`, it appends `'NO'` to `answers`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
