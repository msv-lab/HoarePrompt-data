Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation.
2. The provided solution uses three functions:
   - `func_1`: Applies the operation to the array.
   - `func_2`: Checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - `func_3`: Attempts to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying `func_1` to the highest value in the array until either all elements are zero or the operation is attempted 100 times.
3. The logic in `func_3` is sound:
   - It first checks if the array is already all zeros using `func_2`. If so, it immediately returns 'YES'.
   - It then enters a loop where it finds the highest value in the array and applies the operation to it using `func_1`.
   - After each operation, it checks again if the array is all zeros using `func_2`. If so, it returns 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes 100 times without making all elements zero, it returns 'NO'.
4. Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summaries, the functions correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
