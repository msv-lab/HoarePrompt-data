### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`
This function takes an array and an index, and performs the specified operation:
- Decreases the element at `index - 1` by 1.
- Decreases the element at `index` by 2.
- Decreases the element at `index + 1` by 1.

#### Function `func_2`
This function checks if all elements in the array are zero:
- Returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
- Returns `True` if all elements are zero.

#### Function `func_3`
This function attempts to transform the array into an array of all zeros using the specified operations:
1. If `func_2` returns `True` initially, it appends `'YES'` to the `answers` list and returns.
2. Otherwise, it enters a loop where it:
   - Finds the highest value in the array and its index.
   - Applies `func_1` to the array at that index.
   - Checks if the resulting array is all zeros using `func_2`.
   - If `func_2` returns `True`, it appends `'YES'` to the `answers` list and returns.
   - If the loop completes 100 iterations without finding a suitable modification, it appends `'NO'` to the `answers` list and returns.

#### Analysis of the Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly and fails to account for the critical condition that the sum of the array must be divisible by 3 for all elements to be zero.

Let's validate this claim by considering the following points:

1. **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the array must be divisible by 3 for it to be possible to make all elements zero using the specified operations. This is a necessary condition, but not sufficient. We need to ensure that the operations can be applied in a way that eventually makes all elements zero.

2. **Operation Effectiveness**: The operation reduces three elements by a total of 4 (1 + 2 + 1). This means that the sum of the array decreases by 4 with each operation. Therefore, the sum of the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to make all elements zero.

3. **Implementation**: The function `func_3` attempts to find the highest value and apply the operation repeatedly. However, it does not guarantee that the operations can be applied in a way that eventually makes all elements zero. The loop may terminate prematurely if it does not find a suitable modification, even if such a modification exists.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. The function `func_3` does not handle all potential cases correctly and fails to ensure that the operations can be applied in a way that eventually makes all elements zero.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all necessary conditions to determine if the array can be transformed into all zeros using the specified operations.
