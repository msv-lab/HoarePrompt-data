Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Specifically, the `func_3` function does not handle all potential cases correctly. Here's a counterexample to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. According to the problem description, we need to check if it's possible to make all elements zero using the specified operations. However, the current implementation does not account for all necessary conditions to determine if such a transformation is possible.

One key issue is that the function only checks the highest value in the array and applies the operation to it repeatedly until it finds an array where all elements are zero or determines that it's impossible. This approach is flawed because it doesn't ensure that the operations can be applied in a way that eventually makes all elements zero.

For instance, in the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, applying the operation to the highest value (5) multiple times might not lead to a situation where all elements become zero. A more comprehensive approach would involve checking if the sum of the array is divisible by 3, which is a necessary condition for making all elements zero using the given operations.

Since the provided code does not handle this critical condition and fails to correctly determine if the array can be transformed into all zeros, the program is incorrect.
