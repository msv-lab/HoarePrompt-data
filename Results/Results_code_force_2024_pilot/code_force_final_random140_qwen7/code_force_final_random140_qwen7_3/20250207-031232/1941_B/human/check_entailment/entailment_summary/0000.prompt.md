Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1

    0 1 3 3 1
    
    6
    
    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
answers = []
numberOfArrays = int(input())
for arrayCounter in range(0, numberOfArrays):
    elementSize = int(input())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_3(array)
for ans in answers:
    print(f'{ans}')

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(array, index):
    array[index - 1] = array[index - 1] - 1
    array[index] = array[index] - 2
    array[index + 1] = array[index + 1] - 1
    return array
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `index`. It returns a new list where the element at position `index-1` is decreased by 1, the element at position `index` is decreased by 2, and the element at position `index+1` is decreased by 1, while all other elements remain unchanged.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(arrayForSuccess):
    for x in arrayForSuccess:
        if x != 0:
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers named `arrayForSuccess`. It iterates through each element in the list. If any element is not equal to zero, the function immediately returns `False`. If all elements are zero, the function also returns `False`. In all cases, the function guarantees to return `False`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(inputarray):
    if func_2(inputarray):
        answers.append('YES')
        return
    loop_counter = 1
    while loop_counter != 100:
        length = len(inputarray)
        highestNumber = -1
        highestIndex = -1
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        if highestNumber < 0:
            answers.append('NO')
            return
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        if func_2(newArray):
            answers.append('YES')
            return
        loop_counter += 1
    answers.append('NO')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `inputarray` and may return 'YES' if certain conditions are met during its execution. If these conditions are not met, the function does not return any value. Specifically, the function iterates through the list, identifies the highest number and its index, and modifies the list based on this information. It then checks if the modified list satisfies a condition using `func_2`. If `func_2` returns 'YES', the function appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns. If the loop completes 100 iterations without finding a suitable modification, the function appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns. If `func_2` never returns 'YES' within the loop, the function also appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns. In cases where the function does not return a value, it indicates that none of the conditions were satisfied.
