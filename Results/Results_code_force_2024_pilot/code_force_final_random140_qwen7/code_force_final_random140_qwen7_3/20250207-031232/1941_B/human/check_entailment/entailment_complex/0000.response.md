Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly performs the specified operation on the array. It decreases the element at `index-1` by 1, the element at `index` by 2, and the element at `index+1` by 1. This function is implemented correctly and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. It returns `False` if any element is non-zero, which is correct. However, it should return `True` if all elements are zero, but it currently returns `False` in all cases. This needs to be corrected to ensure it returns `True` when all elements are zero.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the operations defined. It first checks if the array is already zero using `func_2`. If not, it finds the highest value and its index, applies the operation defined in `func_1`, and checks again with `func_2`. If it cannot make the array all zeros within 100 iterations, it concludes the array cannot be reduced to all zeros. The logic here is flawed because it incorrectly uses `func_2` to check the result, which always returns `False`.

Given the above analysis, the issue lies in the implementation of `func_2` and the overall logic in `func_3`. The function `func_2` should return `True` when all elements are zero, and `func_3` should correctly use this function to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

Since the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
