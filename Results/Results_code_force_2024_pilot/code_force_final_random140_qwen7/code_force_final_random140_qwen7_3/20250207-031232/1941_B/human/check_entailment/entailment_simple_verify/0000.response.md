### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- This function takes an array and an index `index` (where \(2 \leq index \leq n-1\)).
- It performs the specified operation: decreases the element at `index-1` by 1, the element at `index` by 2, and the element at `index+1` by 1.
- This function correctly implements the operation as described in the problem statement.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
- If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
- If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
- This function correctly checks if the array is all zeros.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`):
- This function attempts to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.
- It first checks if the array is already all zeros using `func_2`.
- If the array is already all zeros, it appends 'YES' to `answers` and returns.
- If the array is not all zeros, it enters a loop that iterates up to 100 times.
- In each iteration, it finds the highest value in the array and applies the operation using `func_1` to the index of this highest value.
- After applying the operation, it checks if the new array is all zeros using `func_2`.
- If the new array is all zeros, it appends 'YES' to `answers` and returns.
- If the loop completes without finding an array that is all zeros, it appends 'NO' to `answers`.

#### Key Points:
1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where the array is already all zeros correctly.
2. **Loop Limitation**: The loop runs up to 100 times, which is a reasonable limit to prevent infinite loops.
3. **Finding the Highest Value**: The program correctly identifies the highest value in the array and applies the operation to it.
4. **Checking for Zero Array**: The program correctly checks if the array becomes all zeros after applying the operation.

#### Counterexample Analysis:
The original assessment mentioned a counterexample: the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. Let's walk through the program's behavior with this array:

1. Initial array: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
2. Highest value is 5, located at index 3.
3. Apply the operation to index 3: `[2, 4, 3, 3, 0]`
4. Highest value is 4, located at index 1.
5. Apply the operation to index 1: `[1, 2, 3, 3, 0]`
6. Continue this process, but it's clear that the array will never reach all zeros due to the nature of the operations.

However, the program correctly identifies that the array cannot be made all zeros and appends 'NO' to `answers`.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made all zeros using the specified operations. The original assessment was overly critical and did not fully consider the program's ability to handle the problem correctly within the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
