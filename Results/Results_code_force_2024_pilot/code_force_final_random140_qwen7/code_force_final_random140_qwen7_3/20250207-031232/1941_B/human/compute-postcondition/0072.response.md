The loop condition is `loop_counter != 100`. For the loop to execute one more time, `loop_counter` must be adjusted such that it becomes 100.

Let's break down the states:

- `elementIndex` is 97: This state does not affect the loop condition.
- `length` is greater than 100: This state does not affect the loop condition.
- `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97: This state does not affect the loop condition.
- `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97: This state does not affect the loop condition.
- `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`: This state does not affect the loop condition.
- `loop_counter` is 101: To satisfy the loop condition `loop_counter != 100`, `loop_counter` needs to be adjusted to 100.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `loop_counter`.

State: **`elementIndex` is 97, `length` is greater than 100, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` must be 100**
