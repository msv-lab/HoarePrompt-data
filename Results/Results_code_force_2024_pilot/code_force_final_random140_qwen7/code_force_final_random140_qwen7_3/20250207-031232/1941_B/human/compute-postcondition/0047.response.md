Postcondition: `elementIndex` is 1, `length` is greater than 2, and `highestNumber` is the maximum value among `inputarray[1]` and the current `highestNumber`. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[elementIndex]` and `highestIndex` remains 1.
