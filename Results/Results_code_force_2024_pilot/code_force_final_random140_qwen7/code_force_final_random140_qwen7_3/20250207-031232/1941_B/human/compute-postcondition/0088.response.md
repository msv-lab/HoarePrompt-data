Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `elementIndex` is 98.
   - `length` is greater than 98.
   - `highestIndex` is 98.
   - `highestNumber` is the value of `inputarray[98]`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `elementIndex = 1` to `elementIndex < length - 1`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `elementIndex`**:
   - Since the loop starts from `elementIndex = 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `elementIndex` would be `99`.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The condition `elementIndex < length - 1` must hold true for the loop to continue.
   - Given that `length` is greater than 98, it is also greater than 99 (since `elementIndex` is incremented to 99).

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `elementIndex` will be 99.
   - `length` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 99.
   - `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` remain the same as they are not affected by the loop head variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`elementIndex` is 99, `length` is greater than 99, `highestIndex` is 98, and `highestNumber` is the value of `inputarray[98]`**.
