Output State: `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index where the highest value in `inputarray` was found during the loop's execution, `highestNumber` is the highest value itself, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments, `loop_counter` is 100, and `func_2(newArray)` has been called 99 times and returned `False` each time.

This means that the loop has executed 100 times, checking each element in the array except the first and last elements. The `loop_counter` is now 100, and since the condition `loop_counter != 100` is no longer true, the loop will terminate. The `elementIndex` is set to `length - 2` because the loop increments `loop_counter` before checking the condition, so it checks up to the second-to-last element. The `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` are determined based on the maximum value found in the array during the loop's execution. The `newArray` is the result of the last call to `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`. Since `func_2(newArray)` has been called 99 times and returned `False` each time, it will not append 'YES' to `answers` and the loop will exit without appending 'NO' either, meaning `answers` remains unchanged.
