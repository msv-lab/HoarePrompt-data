Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `length - 2` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `elementIndex` is 1.
   - `length` is greater than 2.
   - `highestNumber` is the maximum value among `inputarray[1]` and the current `highestNumber`.
   - If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[elementIndex]` and `highestIndex` remains 1.

4. **Calculate the next `elementIndex`**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `length - 2`, if `elementIndex` is currently 1, the next value for `elementIndex` would be `2`.

5. **Check the new state**:
   - `elementIndex` will be 2.
   - `length` must still be greater than 2.
   - `highestNumber` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration unless `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, in which case `highestNumber` would be updated to `inputarray[2]`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `elementIndex` is now 2.
   - `length` must still be greater than 2.
   - `highestNumber` remains the same unless `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`elementIndex` is 2, `length` is greater than 2, and `highestNumber` is the maximum value among `inputarray[1]` and the current `highestNumber`.**
