Output State: **`elementIndex` is 99, `length` is greater than 99, `highestIndex` is 99, `highestNumber` is the value of `inputarray[99]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `highestNumber` to be the same as `inputarray[elementIndex]`, which is `inputarray[99]` since `elementIndex` is 99. The other variables (`elementIndex`, `length`, and `highestIndex`) remain unchanged.
