Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is len(inputarray), `highestIndex` is the index of the largest element in the subarray `inputarray[1:98]`, `highestNumber` is -1, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is 100**.

Explanation: The line `highestNumber = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `highestNumber`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
