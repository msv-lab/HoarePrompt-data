The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `answers`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `answers`, we assume it is initially empty. After appending 'YES', the list `answers` will contain one element, which is 'YES'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`elementIndex` is 97, `length` is greater than 100, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is 100, and `answers` is ['YES'].**
