Output State: **`elementIndex` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `highestNumber` is a number such that the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, `highestIndex` is 1**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 1) to `highestIndex`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
