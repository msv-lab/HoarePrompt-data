Postcondition: `elementIndex` is 98, `length` is greater than 98, and `highestIndex` is 98, `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[98]` if `inputarray[98]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`. If `inputarray[98]` is less than `highestNumber`, the values of `elementIndex`, `length`, and `highestIndex` remain unchanged.
