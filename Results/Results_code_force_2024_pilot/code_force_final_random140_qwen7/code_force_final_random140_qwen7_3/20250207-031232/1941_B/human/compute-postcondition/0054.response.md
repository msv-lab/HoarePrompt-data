Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop starts from `elementIndex = 1` and ends at `elementIndex = length - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `elementIndex` must be less than `length - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `elementIndex` is 2.
   - `length` is greater than 2.

4. **Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `elementIndex` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Since `length` is greater than 2, `length` does not change.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `elementIndex` will be incremented to 3.
   - `length` remains unchanged and is still greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`elementIndex` is 3, `length` is greater than 2**
