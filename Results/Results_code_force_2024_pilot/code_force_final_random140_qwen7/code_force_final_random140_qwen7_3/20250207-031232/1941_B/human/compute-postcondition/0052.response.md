Postcondition: `elementIndex` is 2, `length` is greater than 2, and `highestNumber` is the maximum value among `inputarray[2]` and the current `highestNumber`. If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` remains unchanged and `highestIndex` is set to 2. Otherwise, `highestNumber` remains unchanged.
