Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is greater than 98, and `highestIndex` is 98, `highestNumber` is inputarray[98]**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to the variable `highestNumber`. Given that `elementIndex` is 98, `highestNumber` is set to the value of `inputarray[98]`. The values of `elementIndex`, `length`, and `highestIndex` remain unchanged.
