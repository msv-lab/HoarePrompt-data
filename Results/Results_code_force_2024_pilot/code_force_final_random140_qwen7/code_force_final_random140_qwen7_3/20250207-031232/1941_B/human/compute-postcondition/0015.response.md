Postcondition: `elementIndex` is 1, `length` is at least 3, and `highestNumber` is the maximum value among `inputarray[1]` and `highestNumber`. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[elementIndex]` and `highestIndex` is set to `elementIndex`. Otherwise, `highestNumber` remains unchanged.
