Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `elementIndex` in the range from 1 to `length - 1`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `elementIndex` and `length`**:
   - `elementIndex` is initially set to 97.
   - `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray`.
   - `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` are not relevant to the loop condition.
   - `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, but this is not directly related to the loop condition.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `elementIndex` must be within the range `[1, length - 1]`.
   - Since `elementIndex` is initially 97, we need to ensure that `length` is greater than 98 (because `elementIndex` must be less than `length`).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `elementIndex` should be within the range `[1, length - 1]`.
   - `length` must be greater than 98.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `elementIndex` and `length`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`elementIndex` is 97, `length` must be greater than 98**
