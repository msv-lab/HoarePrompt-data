Postcondition: `elementIndex` is 2, `length` is greater than 2, and if `inputarray[2]` (which is `inputarray[elementIndex]`) is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` remains unchanged and `highestIndex` is 2. If `inputarray[2]` is less than `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` remains unchanged.
