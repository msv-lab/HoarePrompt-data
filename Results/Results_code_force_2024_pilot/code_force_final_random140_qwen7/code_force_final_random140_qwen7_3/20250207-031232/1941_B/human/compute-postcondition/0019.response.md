Postcondition: `elementIndex` is 2, `highestNumber` remains the maximum value among `inputarray[2]` and `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex` is 2 if `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`. If `inputarray[2]` is less than `highestNumber`, the values of `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged.
