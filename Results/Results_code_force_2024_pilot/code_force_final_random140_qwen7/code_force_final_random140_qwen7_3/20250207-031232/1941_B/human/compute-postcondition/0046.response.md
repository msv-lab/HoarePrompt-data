Output State: **`elementIndex` is 1; `length` is greater than 2; `highestNumber` is `inputarray[elementIndex]`; `highestIndex` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` now holds the value of `inputarray[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
