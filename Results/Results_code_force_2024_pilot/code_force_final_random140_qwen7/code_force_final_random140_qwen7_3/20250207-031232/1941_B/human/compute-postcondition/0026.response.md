Output State: `elementIndex` is 98, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray `inputarray[1:99]`, and `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value within this subarray.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `elementIndex` starting at 1 up to `length-2`. Given that the loop runs until `elementIndex` is less than `length`, and `length` is at least 3, after 98 iterations, `elementIndex` will be 98. During these iterations, the loop updates `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` whenever it finds a value in `inputarray` that is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`. By the end of the loop, `highestNumber` will hold the maximum value found in the subarray `inputarray[1:99]`, and `highestIndex` will be the index of this maximum value within that subarray.
