Postcondition: `elementIndex` is 1, `length` is at least 3, and `highestNumber` is the maximum value among `inputarray[1]` and `highestNumber` (which is initially `inputarray[elementIndex]`). If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` remains unchanged and `highestIndex` is 1. Otherwise, `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[elementIndex]`.
