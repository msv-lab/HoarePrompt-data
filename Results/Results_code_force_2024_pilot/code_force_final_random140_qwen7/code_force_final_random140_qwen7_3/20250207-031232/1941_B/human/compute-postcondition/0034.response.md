Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is at least 100, `highestIndex` is the index of the largest element in the subarray `inputarray[1:98]`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray `inputarray[1:98]`, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns True, `answers` list has 'YES' appended to it.**

Explanation: The line `answers.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `answers`. No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
