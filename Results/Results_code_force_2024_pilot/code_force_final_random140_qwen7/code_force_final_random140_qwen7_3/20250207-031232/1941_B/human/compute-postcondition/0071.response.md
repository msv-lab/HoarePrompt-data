Output State: **`elementIndex` is 97, `length` is greater than 100, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is 101.**

Explanation: The `loop_counter` variable was incremented by 1, changing its value from 100 to 101. All other variables retain their initial conditions as specified in the initial state.
