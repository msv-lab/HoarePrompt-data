The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `answers`. Since `answers` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending `'NO'` to the list, the length of `answers` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`elementIndex` is 97, `length` is greater than 100, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` with the final `highestIndex`, `loop_counter` is 100, and `answers` is a list containing one element `'NO'`.**
