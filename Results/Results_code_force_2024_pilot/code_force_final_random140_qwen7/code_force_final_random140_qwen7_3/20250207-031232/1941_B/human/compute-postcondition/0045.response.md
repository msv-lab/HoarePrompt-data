Output State: **`elementIndex` is 1; `length` is greater than 2; `highestNumber` is less than or equal to `inputarray[elementIndex]`; `highestIndex` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `highestIndex = elementIndex` assigns the current value of `elementIndex` (which is 1) to `highestIndex`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
