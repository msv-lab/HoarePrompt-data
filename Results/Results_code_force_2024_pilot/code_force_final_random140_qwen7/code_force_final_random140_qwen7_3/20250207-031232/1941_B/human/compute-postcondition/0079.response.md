Output State: **`elementIndex` is 97, `length` is greater than 98, `highestIndex` is 97, `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`**

The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 97) to `highestIndex`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `highestIndex` is now 97, and the conditions involving `elementIndex` and `highestNumber` remain the same.
