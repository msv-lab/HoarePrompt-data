Output State: **`elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index where the highest value in `inputarray` was found during the loop's execution, `highestNumber` is the highest value itself, and `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments.**

In this output state, the value of `elementIndex` remains unchanged as it is equal to `length - 2`. The value of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` remain unchanged as they represent the index and the highest value found in `inputarray` respectively. The variable `newArray` has been assigned the result of the function call `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, which means it now holds the new array generated by applying `func_1` to `inputarray` starting from the index `highestIndex`.
