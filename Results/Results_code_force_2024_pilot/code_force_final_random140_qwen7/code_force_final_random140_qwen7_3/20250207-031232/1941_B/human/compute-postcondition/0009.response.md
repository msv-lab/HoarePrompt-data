Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains three variables: `elementIndex`, `length`, and the range function itself.

2. **Determine the Range Function**: The range function is defined as `range(1, length - 1)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `elementIndex` starting from 1 up to `length - 2`.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `loop_counter` must be less than 100 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop head).
   - `length` is the length of the input array `inputarray`.
   - `highestIndex` is -1 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop head).

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `elementIndex` must be within the range specified by the range function, i.e., `1` to `length - 2`.
   - The loop will start with `elementIndex = 1` and continue until `elementIndex < length - 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `elementIndex = 1`, we need to ensure that `elementIndex` is initially set to 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `elementIndex < length - 1`, so `length` must be at least 3 (since the loop goes up to `length - 2`).

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the states of `elementIndex` and `length` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`elementIndex` is 1, `length` must be at least 3**
