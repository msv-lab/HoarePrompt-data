Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is at least 100, `highestIndex` is the index of the largest element in the subarray `inputarray[1:98]`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray `inputarray[1:98]` and is lower than 0, `answers` contains 'NO'**.

The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `answers`. Since `answers` did not exist before, it is initialized as a list containing `'NO'`. The values of `elementIndex`, `length`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber` remain unchanged.
