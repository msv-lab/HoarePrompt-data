You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: inputarray is a list of integers, where the length of the list is n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and each element a_j (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9).
def func_3(inputarray):
    if func_2(inputarray) :
        answers.append('YES')
        return
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State: inputarray is a list of integers, where the length of the list is n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and each element a_j (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). The function func_2(inputarray) returns False
    loop_counter = 1
    while loop_counter != 100:
        length = len(inputarray)
        
        highestNumber = -1
        
        highestIndex = -1
        
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        
        if highestNumber < 0:
            answers.append('NO')
            return
        
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        
        if func_2(newArray):
            answers.append('YES')
            return
        
        loop_counter += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index where the highest value in `inputarray` was found during the loop's execution, `highestNumber` is the highest value itself, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments, `loop_counter` is 100, and `func_2(newArray)` has been called 99 times and returned `False` each time.
    #
    #This means that the loop has executed 100 times, checking each element in the array except the first and last elements. The `loop_counter` is now 100, and since the condition `loop_counter != 100` is no longer true, the loop will terminate. The `elementIndex` is set to `length - 2` because the loop increments `loop_counter` before checking the condition, so it checks up to the second-to-last element. The `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` are determined based on the maximum value found in the array during the loop's execution. The `newArray` is the result of the last call to `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`. Since `func_2(newArray)` has been called 99 times and returned `False` each time, it will not append 'YES' to `answers` and the loop will exit without appending 'NO' either, meaning `answers` remains unchanged.
    answers.append('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter inputarray, which is a list of integers. The length of the list is between 3 and 200,000, and each element in the list is an integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000. The function may return 'YES' in some cases, but in other cases, it may return None or not return any value at all because there are no return statements specified in the given code snippet.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES'

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program returns None

Case_4: The program returns None

Case_5: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.

Case_6: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.

Case_7: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
