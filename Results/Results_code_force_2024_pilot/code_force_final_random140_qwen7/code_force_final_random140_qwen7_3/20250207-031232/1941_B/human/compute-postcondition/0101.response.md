Output State: **`elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index where the highest value in `inputarray` was found during the loop's execution, `highestNumber` is the highest value itself, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments, and `answers` contains 'YES'**.

The code appends 'YES' to the list `answers`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The `elementIndex`, `highestIndex`, `highestNumber`, and `newArray` retain their initial values from the precondition.
