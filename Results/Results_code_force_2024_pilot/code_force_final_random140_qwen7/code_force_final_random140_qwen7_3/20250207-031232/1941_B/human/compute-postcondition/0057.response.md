Postcondition: `elementIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` is the maximum value between the original `highestNumber` (which was inputarray[3]) and inputarray[3]. If inputarray[3] is greater than or equal to the original `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is also set to 3; otherwise, `highestIndex` remains unchanged.
