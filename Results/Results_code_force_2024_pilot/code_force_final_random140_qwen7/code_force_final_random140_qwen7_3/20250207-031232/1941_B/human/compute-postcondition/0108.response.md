Output State: **`elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index where the highest value in `inputarray` was found during the loop's execution, `highestNumber` is the highest value itself, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments, `loop_counter` is 100, `func_2(newArray)` has been called 99 times and returned `False` each time, and `answers` contains 'NO'.**

Explanation: The code appends 'NO' to the `answers` list. Since `func_2(newArray)` has already been called 99 times and returned `False` each time, appending 'NO' to `answers` does not change its content. Therefore, `answers` remains unchanged and still contains 'NO'. All other variables retain their previous values.
