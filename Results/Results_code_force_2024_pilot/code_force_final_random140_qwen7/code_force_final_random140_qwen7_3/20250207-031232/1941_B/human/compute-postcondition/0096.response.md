Output State: **`elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `length` is greater than `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index where the highest value in `inputarray` was found during the loop's execution, `highestNumber` is less than 0, and 'NO' is appended to `answers`.**

The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `answers`. The values of `elementIndex`, `length`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber` remain unchanged from their initial states.
