Output State: **`elementIndex` is 97, `length` is greater than 98, `highestIndex` is 97, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[97]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Given that `elementIndex` is 97, `highestNumber` now holds the value of `inputarray[97]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
