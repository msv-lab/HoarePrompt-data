Output State: **`loop_counter` must be less than 100; `length` is the length of the input array provided by `inputarray`; `highestNumber` is -1**

Explanation: The code initializes `highestNumber` to -1. This does not affect the values of `loop_counter` or `length`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions. The new information is that `highestNumber` is now set to -1.
