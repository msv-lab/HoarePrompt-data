Postcondition: `elementIndex` is 97, `length` is greater than 100, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is 100. Additionally, `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.
