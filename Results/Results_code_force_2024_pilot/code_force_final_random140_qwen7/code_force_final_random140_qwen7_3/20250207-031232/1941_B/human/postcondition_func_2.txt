The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `inputarray` and may return 'YES' if certain conditions are met during its execution. If these conditions are not met, the function does not return any value. Specifically, the function iterates through the list, identifies the highest number and its index, and modifies the list based on this information. It then checks if the modified list satisfies a condition using `func_2`. If `func_2` returns 'YES', the function appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns. If the loop completes 100 iterations without finding a suitable modification, the function appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns. If `func_2` never returns 'YES' within the loop, the function also appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns. In cases where the function does not return a value, it indicates that none of the conditions were satisfied.
