t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 \cdot 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), a positive integer representing the size of the array a, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. It is also given that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
