Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or block. In this case, since the initial conditions are given and no variables are modified within the scope of the `break` statement, the only effect is that the loop or block is exited. Therefore, the values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and we simply indicate that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
