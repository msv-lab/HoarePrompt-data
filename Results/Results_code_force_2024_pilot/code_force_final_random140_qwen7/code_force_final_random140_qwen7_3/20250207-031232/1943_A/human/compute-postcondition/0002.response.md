Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list named `a`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
