Output State: **`cntl` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is 0, `a` is an input list of integers, `c` retains its initial value of either 0 or -1 based on the initial state of `cntl[n]`, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cntl` as a list of zeros with a length of `n+1`. This means that every element in `cntl` is set to 0. The values of `a`, `c`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
