Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2 but its exact value is not specified.
- `cntl[2]` is either `cntl[2] - 1` or remains unchanged, but since no initial value for `cntl[2]` is given, we cannot determine its exact value.
- `c` is `c - 1`, but again, no initial value for `c` is provided, so we cannot determine its exact value.

However, the `print(j)` statement only depends on the value of `j`, which is explicitly given as 3.

Output: **3**
