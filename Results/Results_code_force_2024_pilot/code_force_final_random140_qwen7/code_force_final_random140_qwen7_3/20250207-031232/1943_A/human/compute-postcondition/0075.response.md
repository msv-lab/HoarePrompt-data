Given the initial state where the list `cntl` is updated such that each element `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`, and since the list `a` is empty, there are no occurrences of any `i` in `a` to increment the elements of `cntl`. Therefore, the value of `cntl[0]` remains 0.

The print statement simply outputs the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
