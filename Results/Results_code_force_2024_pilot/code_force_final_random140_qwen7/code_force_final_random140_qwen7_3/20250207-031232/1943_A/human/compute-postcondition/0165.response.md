Output State: **`j` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `cntl[j]` is less than 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement. However, it does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, or `cntl[j]`. The condition that `c` is -1 or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement is no longer relevant since the break statement has been executed.
