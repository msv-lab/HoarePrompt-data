Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in a:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `i` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the list `a`. Once `a` is exhausted, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` will take on each value from the list `a`, we don't need to specify the exact value of `i` initially; instead, we need to ensure that the list `a` is not empty.
   - The list `a` should contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that the list `a` contains at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `cntl`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**.
