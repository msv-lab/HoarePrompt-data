Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is a non-negative integer (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement).
- `cntl[2]` is a valid value but its exact value is not specified.
- `c` is explicitly given as 0.

The print statement is simply `print(j)`. Since `j` is explicitly given as 2, the print statement will output the value of `j`.

Output: **2**
