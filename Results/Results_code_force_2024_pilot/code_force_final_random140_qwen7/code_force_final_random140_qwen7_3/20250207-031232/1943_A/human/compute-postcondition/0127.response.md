Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. This means the only objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `a`**:
   - `i` is the variable that will iterate over the elements of the list `a`.
   - `a` is the list of integers.

3. **Initial state of the given variables**:
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is 0.
   - `a` is an input list of integers.
   - `c` retains its initial value of either 0 or -1 based on the initial state of `cntl[n]`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since `i` will be iterating over the elements of `a`, the initial state of `i` should be set to the first element of `a`.
   - The list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` should be the first element of `a`.
   - `a` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is the first element of `a`, `a` must have at least one element**
