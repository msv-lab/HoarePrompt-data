Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `cntl[j]` is less than 1, and `c` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
