Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - Either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `cntl[j]` is less than 1 and `c` is false.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < n + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented to 3 (since the loop starts from 1).
   - The condition `n > 0` remains unchanged as it is a precondition and does not change within the loop.
   - The states related to breaking conditions (`cntl[j]` and `c`) are not directly controlled by the loop itself but by the loop body, which is omitted. Therefore, these states remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

5. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `j` must be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - The states related to breaking conditions (`cntl[j]` and `c`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `cntl[j]` is less than 1 and `c` is false**.
