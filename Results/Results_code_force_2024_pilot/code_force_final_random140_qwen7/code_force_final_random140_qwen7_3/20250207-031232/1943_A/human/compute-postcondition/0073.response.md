Output State: The list `cntl` is updated such that each element `cntl[i]` (where `i` is an integer from the list `a`) is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`. The list `a` is empty after all iterations of the loop have completed, and `c` remains either 0 or -1 based on the initial condition of `cntl[n]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `cntl` list will show how many times each index present in the original list `a` was encountered. The list `a` will be empty because all its elements have been processed, and `c` will retain its initial value of either 0 or -1, depending on the initial state of `cntl[n]`.
