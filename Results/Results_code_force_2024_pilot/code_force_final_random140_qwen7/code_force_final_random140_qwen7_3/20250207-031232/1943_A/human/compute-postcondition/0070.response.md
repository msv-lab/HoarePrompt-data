Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` contains at least one element.
   - `i` is the first element of `a`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - The variable `i` takes on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `a` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is the first element of `a` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element in `a` will be the second element (if it exists).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still contain at least one element.
   - Therefore, `i` will be set to the second element of `a` if it exists.

5. **Final State:**
   - `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be the second element of `a` if it exists.

Given this analysis, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `a` contains at least one element, and `i` is the second element of `a` if it exists**.
