Output State: **`j` is 3, `cntl[j]` is less than 1, `c` is false and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block indicated, the `break` statement implies that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional context. The values of `j`, `cntl[j]`, and `c` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables.
