Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `cntl[j]` is less than 1, and `c` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1. Since `j` is initially 1, and `cntl[j]` is less than 2 but not equal to 0, after executing `c -= 1`, `cntl[j]` will now be less than 1 (because it was already less than 2 and not 0, so subtracting 1 from it will make it even smaller, but still not 0). The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
