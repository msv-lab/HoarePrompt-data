Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `cntl[2]` is either `cntl[2] - 1` or remains unchanged, and `c` is `c - 1`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, since no loop or case structure was specified, the `break` statement does not alter the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, `cntl[2]`, and `c` remain as they were in the initial state.
