Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `cntl[2]` is either `cntl[2] - 1` or remains unchanged.
   - If `cntl[2]` was 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `c` is not zero, `c` is decreased by 1 and the program continues without further changes to `j`, `n`, `cntl[2]`, and `c`.
   - If `c` is zero, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider the typical behavior of such a loop. Typically, the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration.
5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - `n` remains the same since it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `cntl[2]` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume it remains unchanged.
   - `c` is not mentioned as being modified in the loop body, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `cntl[2]` is either `cntl[2] - 1` or remains unchanged, and `c` remains unchanged**.
