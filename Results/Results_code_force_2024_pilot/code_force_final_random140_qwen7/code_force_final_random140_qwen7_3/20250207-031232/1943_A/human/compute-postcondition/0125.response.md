Output State: **`a` is an input list of integers, `cntl` is updated such that each element `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`, `c` retains its initial value of either 0 or -1 based on the initial state of `cntl[n]`, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The `cntl` list is updated based on the occurrences of each element in `a`, but since no specific values or occurrences are provided, the exact state of `cntl` cannot be determined. The value of `c` remains unchanged or is decremented by up to 2 depending on its initial value and the conditions within the loop, and `n` remains an input integer.
