Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly stated to be 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[j]` is less than 1, but its exact value is not needed.
- `c` is either -1 or the loop/break condition is met, but this does not affect the print statement since it only prints `j`.

Given that the print statement is simply `print(j)`, and `j` is explicitly stated to be 2, the output will be:

Output: **2**
