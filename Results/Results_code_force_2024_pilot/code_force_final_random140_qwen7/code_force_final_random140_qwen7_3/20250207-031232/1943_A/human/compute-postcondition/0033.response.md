Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
   - `c` is 0.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, if the loop is to continue, `j` must be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `cntl[j]` (which is `cntl[2]` now) must still be less than 2.
   - `c` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer.
   - `cntl[2]` must be less than 2.
   - `c` remains 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `j` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, `c` is 0**.
