Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` is a non-negative integer
   - `cntl[2]` is a valid value
   - `c` is either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `cntl[2]`

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from 2 to 3.
   - `n` must remain a non-negative integer and be greater than 2.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `cntl[2]` is a valid value, and `c` is either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `cntl[2]`**.
