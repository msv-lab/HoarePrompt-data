Postcondition: **`cntl` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is equal to the number of times its index appears in the list `a`. The list `a` contains no more than `n` elements, and all elements in `a` are within the range of 0 to `n`. The first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not equal to 0.**
