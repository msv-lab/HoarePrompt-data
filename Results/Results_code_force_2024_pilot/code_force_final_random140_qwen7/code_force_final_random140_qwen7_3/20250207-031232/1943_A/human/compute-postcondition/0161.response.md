Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is stated to be greater than 0, but this does not affect the value of `j`.
- The conditions involving `cntl[j]` and `c` do not change the value of `j`.

The `print(j)` statement will simply print the value of `j`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
