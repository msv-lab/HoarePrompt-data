Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. For each test case, it returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value `t`, another value `n`, and a list `a` of length `n`. The function processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns a value for each test case based on the specified conditions.
