Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `cntl[2]` is `cntl[2] - 1`, and `c` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1. The initial state of `j` being 2, `n` being greater than or equal to 2, and `cntl[2]` being either `cntl[2] - 1` or less than 2 remains unchanged except for `c`, which is now `c - 1`.
