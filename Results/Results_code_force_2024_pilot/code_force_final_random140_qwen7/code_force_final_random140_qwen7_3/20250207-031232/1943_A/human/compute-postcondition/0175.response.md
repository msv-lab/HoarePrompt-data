Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `cntl[j]` is less than 1, `c` is false, `c` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1. Since `j` is initially 3, `cntl[j]` being less than 1 remains unchanged, and `c` being false also remains unchanged. The value of `n` being greater than 0 is unaffected by the code.
