Output State: **`j` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `cntl[j]` is less than 1 and `c` is -1 or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1. Since `c` was initially 0, after executing `c -= 1`, `c` becomes -1. The conditions for `cntl[j]` being less than 2 and `c` being 0 no longer apply because `c` is now -1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
