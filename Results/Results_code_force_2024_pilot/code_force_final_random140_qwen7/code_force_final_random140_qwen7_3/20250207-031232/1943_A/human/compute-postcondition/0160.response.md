Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - This means `j` should be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - Either `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and `c` is 0, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1, for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - The condition involving `cntl[j]` and `c` remains the same because the loop body is omitted and we are only adjusting the loop head variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and either `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and `c` is 0 or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
