Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `j` is 3.
2. `n` must be greater than 0, but `n` itself is not needed to determine the output of the `print(j)` statement.
3. The condition regarding `cntl[j]` being less than 1 and `c` being false does not affect the value of `j` since `j` is already explicitly defined as 3.

Given these points, the `print(j)` statement will simply print the value of `j`.

Output: **3**
