Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is either `cntl[j] - 1` or remains less than 2. If `cntl[j]` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `cntl[j]` was not 0, it is decremented by 1, and if the condition `not c` is true, the loop or statement is also broken out of.
