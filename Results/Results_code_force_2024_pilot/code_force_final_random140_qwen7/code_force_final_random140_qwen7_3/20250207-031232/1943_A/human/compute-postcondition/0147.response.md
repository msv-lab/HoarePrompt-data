Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j` and `n`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 also remains valid.
