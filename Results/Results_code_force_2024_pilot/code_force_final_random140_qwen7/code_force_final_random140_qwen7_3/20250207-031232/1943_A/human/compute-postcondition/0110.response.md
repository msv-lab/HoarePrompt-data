Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly stated to be 3.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2 but does not affect the print statement.
- `cntl[2]` is either `cntl[2] - 1` or remains unchanged, but this does not impact the print statement since it is not used in the print statement.
- `c` remains unchanged, but again, it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement only references `j`, which is explicitly given as 3.

Output: **3**
