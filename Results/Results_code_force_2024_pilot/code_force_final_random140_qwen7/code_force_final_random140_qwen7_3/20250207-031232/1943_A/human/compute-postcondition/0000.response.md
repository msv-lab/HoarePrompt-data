Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python to indicate that the variable is not being used (often referred to as a "throwaway" variable).

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `input()`. Specifically, the loop will run as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop depends on the input value, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself. The loop will continue to execute as long as the input is a positive integer within the specified range for `t`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value for `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4**
