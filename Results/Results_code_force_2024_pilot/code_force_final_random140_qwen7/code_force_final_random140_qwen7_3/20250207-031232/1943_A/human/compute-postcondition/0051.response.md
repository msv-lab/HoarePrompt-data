Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[2]` is a valid value, but its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement.
- `c` is explicitly given as -1, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is simply printing the value of `j`.

Output: **3**
