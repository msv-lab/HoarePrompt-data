Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1, but this value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[j]` is now `cntl[j] - 1`, but it is specified that `cntl[j]` is not 0. This means `cntl[1]` is a non-zero value after decrementing.
- The condition `(not c)` is true, but since `c` is not defined or used in the print statement, this information is not relevant to the output.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `j`.

Output: **1**
