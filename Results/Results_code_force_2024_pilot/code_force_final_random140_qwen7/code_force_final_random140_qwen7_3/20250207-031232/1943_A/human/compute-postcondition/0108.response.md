Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `cntl[2]` is either `cntl[2] - 1` or remains unchanged. If `cntl[2]` was 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not zero, `c` is decreased by 1 and the program continues without further changes to `j`, `n`, `cntl[2]`, and `c`. If `c` is zero, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
