Postcondition: **The list `cntl` is updated such that each element `cntl[i]` (where `i` is an integer from the list `a`) is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`. The list `a` is empty after all iterations of the loop have completed, and `c` is -1 since `cntl[0]` was not initially 0.**
