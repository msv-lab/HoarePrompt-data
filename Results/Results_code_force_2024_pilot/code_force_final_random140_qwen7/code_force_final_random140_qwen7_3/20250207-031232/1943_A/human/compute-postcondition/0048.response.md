Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[2]` is a valid value, but its exact value is not specified.
- `c` is either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `cntl[2]`, but again, the exact value is not necessary to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement only includes `j`, which is explicitly given as 3.

Output: **3**
