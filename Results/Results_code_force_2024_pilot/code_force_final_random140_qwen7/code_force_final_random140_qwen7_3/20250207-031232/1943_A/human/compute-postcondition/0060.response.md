Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, the variable `cntl` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is incremented by the count of its index appearing in the list `a`. The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0, and `cntl[j]` (where `j` is `n`) is a valid value representing the count of `n` in `a`. Additionally, `c` is either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `cntl[n]`.**
