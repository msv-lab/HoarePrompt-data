Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `cntl[2]` is a valid value, `c` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `cntl[2]`, and `c`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code, we assume it breaks out of the implied context, leaving the variables unchanged.
