Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element is 0.
   - `c` is either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `cntl[n]`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `a`, the list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `i` will take on the values from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `i` will take on the values from `a` during each iteration.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `a`**.
