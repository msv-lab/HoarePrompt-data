Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `1` to `n + 1`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `cntl[2]` is a valid value.
   - `c` is either 0 (if `cntl[2]` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) or -1 (if `cntl[2]` is not 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement).

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `1` to `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently 2, the next value of `j` would be 3, as long as `n` is at least 3.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer but must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Post-Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - `cntl[2]` remains a valid value.
   - `c` will be 0 if `cntl[2]` is 0, or -1 if `cntl[2]` is not 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `j` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 3, `cntl[2]` is a valid value, and `c` is either 0 (if `cntl[2]` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) or -1 (if `cntl[2]` is not 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement).**
