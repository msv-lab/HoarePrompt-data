Output State: The variable `a` is a list of integers, and `cntl` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is incremented by the count of its index appearing in the list `a`. After all iterations of the loop, every element in `cntl` will have been incremented by the number of times its index appears in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `cntl` list will contain the count of how many times each index (from 0 to n) appears in the list `a`.
