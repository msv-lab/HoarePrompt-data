Output State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `a` contains at least one element, and `i` is the second element of `a` if it exists.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `a` still contains at least one element, and `i` is still the second element of `a` if it exists.
