Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `cntl[i]` is increased by 1, where `i` is the next element from the list `a`.**

This means that the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the next element from the list `a`. The initial state of `a` being a list of integers with at least one element and `cntl[i]` being increased by 1 remains unchanged in terms of its structure, but the value of `cntl[i]` has been updated.
