Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly set to 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2, but its exact value is not specified.
- The current value of `cntl[2]` is either `cntl[2] - 1` or less than 2. This implies that `cntl[2]` could be any non-negative integer less than 2, meaning it could be 0 or 1.

The print statement is simply printing the value of `j`.

Since `j` is explicitly set to 2, the print statement will output this value.

Output: **2**
