Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cntl` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `cntl` with `n + 1` elements, each set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
