You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where 0 <= a_i < n for all i.
def func_1(n, a):
    sam = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
    a_map = {x: (0) for x in range(n)}
    res = ''
    for i in range(n):
        beg = a_map[a[i]]
        
        res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]
        
        a_map[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 26; `n` is 26; `res` is the concatenation of `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for all `i` from 0 to 25; `beg` is `a_map[a[25]]`; `a_map[a[25]]` is increased by 1.
    #
    #In this final state, the variable `i` reaches the value of `n`, which is 26. The string `res` contains 26 characters, each being `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for `i` ranging from 0 to 25. After the loop completes, `a_map[a[25]]` is incremented by 1.
    return res
    #The program returns a string `res` that is the concatenation of `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for all `i` from 0 to 25, where `i` starts at 26 and `n` is also 26, and `a_map[a[25]]` is incremented by 1 after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. It returns a string `res` that is the concatenation of `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for all `i` from 0 to 25, where `i` starts at 26 and `n` is also 26, and `a_map[a[25]]` is incremented by 1 after the loop completes.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `res` that is the concatenation of `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for all `i` from 0 to 25, where `i` starts at 26 and `n` is also 26, and `a_map[a[25]]` is incremented by 1 after the loop completes.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
