Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is 26; `res` is `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]`; `beg` is `a_map[a[0]]`; `a_map[a[i]]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a_map[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `a_map[a[i]]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. Since the initial value of `a_map[a[0]]` is not specified and only `a_map[a[1]]` is modified, we know that `a_map[a[1]]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
