Output State: **`a_map` is a dictionary where each key from 0 to n-1 maps to 0, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 0 <= `a_i` < `n` for all `i`; `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'.**

Explanation: The code creates a dictionary `a_map` where each key from 0 to `n-1` is mapped to the value 0. The values of `n`, `a`, and `sam` remain unchanged from their initial states.
