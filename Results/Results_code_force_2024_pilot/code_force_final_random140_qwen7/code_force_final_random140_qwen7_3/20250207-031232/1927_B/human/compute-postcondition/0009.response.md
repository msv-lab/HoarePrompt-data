Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 26, `res` is `sam[a_map[a[2]] % 27] + sam[a_map[a[2]] % 27]`, `beg` is `a_map[a[2]]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` to its current value. Given that `a[i]` is `a[2]`, and `a_map[a[2]]` is assigned the value of `a_map[a[2]]`, the expression simplifies to adding `sam[a_map[a[2]] % 27]` to itself, resulting in `res` being updated to `sam[a_map[a[2]] % 27] + sam[a_map[a[2]] % 27]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
