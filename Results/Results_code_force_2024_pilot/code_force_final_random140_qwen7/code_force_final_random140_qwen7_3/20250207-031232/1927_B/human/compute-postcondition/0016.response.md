Output State: `i` is 26; `n` is 26; `res` is the concatenation of `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for all `i` from 0 to 25; `beg` is `a_map[a[25]]`; `a_map[a[25]]` is increased by 1.

In this final state, the variable `i` reaches the value of `n`, which is 26. The string `res` contains 26 characters, each being `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for `i` ranging from 0 to 25. After the loop completes, `a_map[a[25]]` is incremented by 1.
