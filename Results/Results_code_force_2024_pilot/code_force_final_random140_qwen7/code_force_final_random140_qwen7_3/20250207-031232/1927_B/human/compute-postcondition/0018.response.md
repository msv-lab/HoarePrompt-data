Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. It returns a string `res` that is the concatenation of `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for all `i` from 0 to 25, where `i` starts at 26 and `n` is also 26, and `a_map[a[25]]` is incremented by 1 after the loop completes.**
