Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `n` is currently 26.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must hold true. Since `i` is 2 and `n` is 26, the condition `2 < 26` is true, so the loop can execute again.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above adjustments, the new state should reflect these changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 26**
