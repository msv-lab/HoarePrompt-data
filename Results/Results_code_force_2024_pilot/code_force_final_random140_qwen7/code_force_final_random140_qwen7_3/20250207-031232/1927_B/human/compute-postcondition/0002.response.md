Output State: **`a_map` is a dictionary where each key from 0 to n-1 maps to 0, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 0 <= `a_i` < `n` for all `i`; `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'; `res` is an empty string.**

The code initializes an empty string `res`. No changes are made to the other variables (`a_map`, `n`, `a`, and `sam`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
