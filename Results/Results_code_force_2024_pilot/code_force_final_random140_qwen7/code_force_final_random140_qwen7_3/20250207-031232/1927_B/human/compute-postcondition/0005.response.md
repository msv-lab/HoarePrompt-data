Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is 26; `res` is `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]`; `beg` is `a_map[a[0]]`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` to its current value. Initially, `i` is 0, so `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `n` and `beg` remain unchanged. The new value of `res` is the sum of its previous value (which was 0) and `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]`.
