Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 26
   - `res` is `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]`
   - `beg` is `a_map[a[0]]`
   - `a_map[a[i]]` is increased by 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true, and since `n` is 26, `i` being 2 satisfies this condition.
   - The values of `res` and `beg` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 26, `res` is `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]`, `beg` is `a_map[a[0]]`**
