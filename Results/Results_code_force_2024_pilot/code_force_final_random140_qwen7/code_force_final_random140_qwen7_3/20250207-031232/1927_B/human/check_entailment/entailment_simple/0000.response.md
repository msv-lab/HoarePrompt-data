Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Variable Initialization**: Inside the function `func_1`, the variables `sam` and `a_map` are initialized correctly. `sam` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, and `a_map` is a dictionary mapping indices to their initial values (all set to 0).

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`. For each index `i`, it retrieves the value from `a_map` corresponding to `a[i]`, uses it to get a character from `sam`, and appends this character to the result string `res`. After appending the character, it increments the count in `a_map` for the current index `a[i]`.

4. **Final State Analysis**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, so `i` will reach `n-1` (not `26` as mentioned in the comment).
   - `a_map[a[i]]` is incremented for each iteration, ensuring that the counts are updated correctly.
   - The result string `res` is constructed using the characters from `sam` based on the counts in `a_map`.

5. **Output**: The function returns the constructed string `res`, which should match the requirements based on the given trace `a`.

Given the above analysis, the logic in the function `func_1` appears to be correct and should produce the desired output for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
