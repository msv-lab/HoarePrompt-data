You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_1(n, a)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, a):
    sam = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
    a_map = {x: 0 for x in range(n)}
    res = ''
    for i in range(n):
        beg = a_map[a[i]]
        res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]
        a_map[a[i]] += 1
    return res



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. It returns a string `res` that is the concatenation of characters from the string `sam` based on the values in `a_map` modulo 27. After processing all elements in `a`, it increments the value in `a_map` corresponding to the last element in `a` by 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Test Cases Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (length of the string) and `a` (the trace array).
   - Inside `func_1`, a string `sam` containing all lowercase Latin letters is defined.
   - A dictionary `a_map` is initialized to keep track of the count of each character used so far.
   - An empty string `res` is initialized to build the result.

3. **Building the Result String:**
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - `beg` is set to `a_map[a[i]]`, which gives the number of previous occurrences of the character `a[i]` in the string.
     - The character at position `beg` in `sam` is appended to `res`.
     - `a_map[a[i]]` is incremented to reflect the new count of this character.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns the constructed string `res`.

### Verification:

1. **Trace Array Construction:**
   - The trace array `a` is built based on the number of previous occurrences of each character.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the character at position `beg` in `sam` is chosen, which matches the requirement of the problem.

2. **Character Counting:**
   - The dictionary `a_map` keeps track of the count of each character used so far, ensuring that the characters are chosen in the correct order according to their positions in the trace array.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like single-character strings (`n=1`) and the case where the trace array is all zeros.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to construct a string `s` from its trace array `a`. The program follows the problem statement and guarantees that the constructed string will match the given trace.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
