Output State: **`p` is either 1 times `arr[r]` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or 1 times `arr[l]` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R'; `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged, decreased by 1, or increased by 1); `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged or increased by 1); `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values; `ans` contains the value of `p`; `strr` is the last character of `s`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. This does not change the values of `p`, `l`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, `s`, or `strr`. It only adds `p` to `ans`.
