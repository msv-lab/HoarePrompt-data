Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, m is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, a is an array of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and arr is a list of n integers obtained from the first two space-separated integers input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into space-separated values, converts each value to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. The variable `s` is not affected by this code.
