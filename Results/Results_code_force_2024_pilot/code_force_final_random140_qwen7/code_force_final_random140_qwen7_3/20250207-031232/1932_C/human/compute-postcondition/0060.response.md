Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `input_value` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input split and converted to integers, `s` is a string input.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the value of the user's string input to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
