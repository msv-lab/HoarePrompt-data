Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is 'R', `r` is 1**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `s` is a non-empty string and `strr` is 'R'. The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since no specific initial value for `r` was given, we assume `r` starts at 0 (as it's a common default for such operations). After executing `r += 1`, `r` becomes 1. The values of `s` and `strr` remain unchanged.
