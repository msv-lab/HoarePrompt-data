Output State: **`ans` contains the final value of `p` after all iterations, `s` is an empty string, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1 - len(s)`, and `p` is the product of elements from the array `arr` based on the conditions inside the loop, taken modulo `m`.**

To understand this, let's break it down:
- The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `s`.
- For each character `strr` in `s`:
  - If `strr` is 'R', `r` is incremented, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`.
  - If `strr` is 'L', `l` is decremented, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.
- After each iteration, the updated value of `p` is appended to `ans`.
- As the loop progresses, the string `s` gets emptied (since we are iterating over it in reverse and removing characters), and `l` and `r` adjust accordingly.
- Once the loop completes, `s` will be empty, `l` will be 0 (since it starts as the length of the original string and decreases by 1 for each 'L' encountered), and `r` will be `n - 1 - len(s)` (which will also be `n - 1` since `len(s)` is 0).

The final value of `p` in `ans` will be the cumulative product of selected elements from `arr` based on the characters 'R' and 'L' encountered in `s`, taken modulo `m`.
