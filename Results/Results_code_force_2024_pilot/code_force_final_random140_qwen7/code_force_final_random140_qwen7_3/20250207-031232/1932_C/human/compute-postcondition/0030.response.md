Output State: **`p` is 1, `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string `s`, `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s` plus 1, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values, `ans` is an empty list, `strr` is the last character of `s`, and `strr` is equal to 'R'.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is incremented by 1. Since `r` was initially `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s`, after executing `r += 1`, `r` becomes `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
