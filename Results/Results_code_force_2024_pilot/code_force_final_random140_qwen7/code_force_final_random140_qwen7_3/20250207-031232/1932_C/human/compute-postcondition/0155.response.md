Output State: **`ans` is now `p * arr[l] % m`, `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`, `l` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`. The variable `ans` was previously equal to `p`, so now `ans` is `p * arr[l] % m`. The variables `s`, `strr`, and `l` remain unchanged from their previous states.
