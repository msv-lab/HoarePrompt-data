Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `a` is an array of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^4\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the first two space-separated integers input, `s` is the string input from the user, `l` is either 1 or 0 with `l` incremented by 1, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is the next character in the string `s`, and `k` is either 'L' or not 'L'.**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so if `l` was initially 1, it remains 1, and if `l` was initially 0, it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
