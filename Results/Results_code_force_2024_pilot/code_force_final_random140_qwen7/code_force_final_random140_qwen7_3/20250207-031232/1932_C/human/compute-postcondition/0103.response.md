Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the next character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `r` is 1 more than its original value.**

Explanation: The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since `s` and `strr` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The only change is that `r` is now one more than its original value.
