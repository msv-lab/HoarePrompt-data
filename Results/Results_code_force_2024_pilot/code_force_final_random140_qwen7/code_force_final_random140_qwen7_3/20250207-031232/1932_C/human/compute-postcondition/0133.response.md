Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the next character in the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, and `l` is 1 more than its previous value.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `s` is a non-empty string and `k` is the next character in the string `s`, these conditions remain unchanged. Additionally, `r` is decreased by 1, but the exact value of `r` is not specified, so we only note that it has been decreased by 1. The value of `l` is now 1 more than its previous value.
