Output State: **`p` is now either `p * arr[r] % m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or `p * arr[l] % m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R'; `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged, decreased by 1, or increased by 1), `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged or increased by 1); `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values; `ans` contains the value of `p` appended to it; `strr` is the next character from the end of `s`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. This does not change the value of `p` itself, but adds it to the list `ans`. All other variables (`l`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, `s`, `strr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
