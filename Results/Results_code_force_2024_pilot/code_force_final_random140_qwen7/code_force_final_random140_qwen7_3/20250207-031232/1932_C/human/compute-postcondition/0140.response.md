Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over `s[::-1]`. This means the loop variable `strr` will take each character from the reversed version of the string `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `strr` will start with the last character of the original string `s`.
   - Since `s` is initially an empty string, `s[::-1]` will also be an empty string, meaning `strr` will never get a value.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only way for the loop to execute is if `s` is not an empty string. Therefore, `s` must contain at least one character.
   - The initial value of `strr` will be the last character of `s`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must be a non-empty string.
- `strr` will be the last character of `s`.

Since `p`, `l`, `r`, and `ans` are not used within the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`p` is 1, `s` must be a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`**
