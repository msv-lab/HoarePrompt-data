Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in s:`. This means the variables `k` and `s` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is the first integer input - 1.
   - `m` is the second integer input.
   - `input_value` is incremented by 1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the third input split and converted to integers.
   - `s` is a non-empty string (one character shorter).
   - `k` is the first character of the new `s`.
   - `l` is 1 if `k` equals 'L' or 0 if `k` does not equal 'L'.
   - `r` is decremented by 1 if `k` does not equal 'L'.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `k` is the first character of the string `s`, after processing one character, `s` will now be one character shorter.
   - `k` will be the first character of the new `s`.
   - `l` will be 1 if `k` equals 'L' or 0 if `k` does not equal 'L'.
   - `r` will be decremented by 1 if `k` does not equal 'L'.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `s` will be one character shorter than it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `k` will be the first character of the new `s`.
- `l` will be 1 if `k` equals 'L' or 0 if `k` does not equal 'L'.
- `r` will be decremented by 1 if `k` does not equal 'L'.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is the first integer input - 1, `m` is the second integer input, `input_value` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input split and converted to integers, `s` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), `k` is the first character of the new `s`, `l` is 1 if `k` equals 'L' or 0 if `k` does not equal 'L', `r` is decremented by 1 if `k` does not equal 'L'**.
