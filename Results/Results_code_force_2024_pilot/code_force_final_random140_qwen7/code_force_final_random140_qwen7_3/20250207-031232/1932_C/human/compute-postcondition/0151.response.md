Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `strr` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `strr` is set to the current character from the reversed string.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` contains the value of `p`.
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `strr` is the last character of `s`.
   - If `strr` is 'R', then `p` is `arr[1] % m`.
   - Otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `strr` is set to the current character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`, at the start of the next iteration, `strr` will be the next character from the reversed string.
   - `s` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ans` will still contain the value of `p` from the previous iteration unless the condition inside the loop changes it.

5. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `s` must still be a non-empty string.
   - `strr` will be the next character from the reversed string, so it will be the second-to-last character of `s` from the previous iteration.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `s` is a non-empty string (remains the same).
- `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s` from the previous iteration.
- `ans` contains the value of `p` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` contains the value of `p`, `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`**
