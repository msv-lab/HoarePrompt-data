Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for strr in s[::-1]:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `strr` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`. At the end of each iteration, `strr` takes the next character from the reversed string.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the next character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `p` is updated according to the condition specified, `ans` contains the updated value of `p`, and `ans` is appended with the current value of `p`.
   - For the loop to continue, `strr` must be the next character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`. Since `strr` was the next character in the previous iteration, it means `strr` has already been used, and the next character in the reversed string will be the new value of `strr`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `s` remains the same because the loop is iterating over its characters but does not modify `s` itself.
   - `strr` will now be the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`.
   - `p` and `ans` are updated based on the condition and the current value of `strr`, but since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we do not need to specify these changes here.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the next character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`**
