Output State: **`p` is now either `p * arr[r] % m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or `p * arr[l] % m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R'; `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged, decreased by 1, or increased by 1); `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged or increased by 1); `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values; `ans` contains the value of `p` appended to it; `strr` is the next character from the end of `s`; if `strr` is 'R', `r` is increased by 1, otherwise `l` is decreased by 1; `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `p`.**

In this step, the value of `p` is appended to the list `ans`. The values of `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the last character of `s`. The value of `strr` is set to the next character from the end of `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged. The updated value of `p` is included in the list `ans`.
