Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p` is 1, `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string `s`, `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values, and `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p` is either 1 times `arr[r]` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or 1 times `arr[l]` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R'; `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged, decreased by 1, or increased by 1); `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged or increased by 1); `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values; `ans` contains the value of `p`; `strr` is the last character of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p` is now either `p * arr[r] % m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or `p * arr[l] % m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R'; `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged, decreased by 1, or increased by 1), `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged or increased by 1); `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values; `ans` contains the value of `p` appended to it; `strr` is the next character from the end of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p` is now either `p * arr[r] % m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or `p * arr[l] % m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R'; `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged, decreased by 1, or increased by 1); `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged or increased by 1); `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values; `ans` contains the value of `p` appended to it; `strr` is the next character from the end of `s`; if `strr` is 'R', `r` is increased by 1, otherwise `l` is decreased by 1; `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `p`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
