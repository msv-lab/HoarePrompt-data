Postcondition: `p` is an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged, decreased by 1, or increased by 1), `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged or increased by 1), `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values, `ans` contains the value of `p`, `strr` is the next character from the end of `s`. If the last character of `s` is 'R', then `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m` and `r` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m` and `l` is decreased by 1.
