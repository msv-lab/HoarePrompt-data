Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `input_value` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input split and converted to integers, `s` is a string input, `l` is 0.**

The code initializes a variable `l` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `input_value`, `arr`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `l` is updated to 0.
