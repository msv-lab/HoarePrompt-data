Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for strr in s[::-1]:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `strr` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the reversed string `s[::-1]`. This means `strr` takes each character from the reversed string one by one.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated according to some condition, and `ans` contains the updated value of `p`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `strr` must be assigned the next character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, it still has characters left to iterate over.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop is iterating over the reversed string, and `s` itself does not change.
   - `strr` will now be the next character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `strr` and `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the next character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `p` is updated according to the condition specified, `ans` contains the updated value of `p`.**
