Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is defined as `for strr in s[::-1]`. The variables involved in the loop head are `strr` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over the characters of the string `s` in reverse order. At each iteration, `strr` takes the value of the current character being processed.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` now contains the value of `p`.
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`.
   - `l` is decremented by 1.
   - `r` is increased by 1.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`, the next character in the reversed string will be the last character of `s`.
   - For the loop to continue, `s` must still be a non-empty string.
   - `strr` will be updated to the last character of `s`.
   - `l` will be decremented by 1 (as given).
   - `r` will be increased by 1 (as given).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged because it does not affect the loop condition.
   - `s` must still be a non-empty string.
   - `strr` will be the last character of `s`.
   - `l` will be `l - 1`.
   - `r` will be `r + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`ans` now contains the value of `p`, `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `l` is decremented by 1, and `r` is increased by 1**.
