Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `l` is equal to `l-1`, `strr` is the next character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `p` is `p * arr[l] % m`**.

Explanation: The variable `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`. The value of `l` is decreased by 1, so `l` is now `l-1`. The value of `strr` remains unchanged as it was defined before the code snippet and does not get modified by the given code.
