Output State: **`ans` is equal to `p`, `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `l` is decremented by 1, and `r` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `l` has been decreased by 1, while `r` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
