Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the next character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `p` is updated according to the condition specified, `ans` contains the updated value of `p`, `ans` is appended with the current value of `p`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. The values of `s`, `strr`, and `p` remain unchanged from their previous states. The only change is that `ans` now contains the updated value of `p`.
