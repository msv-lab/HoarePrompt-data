Output State: **`ans` contains the value of `p`, `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`, `l` is decremented by 1.**

The code `l -= 1` decrements the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was not initialized or given a specific value in the initial state, we only know that it has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
