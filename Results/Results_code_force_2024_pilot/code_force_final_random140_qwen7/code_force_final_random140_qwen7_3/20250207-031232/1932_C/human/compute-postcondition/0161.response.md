Output State: **`ans` is equal to `p`, `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `l` is decremented by 1, `r` is increased by 2, `p` is equal to `p * arr[r] % m`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to `p * arr[r] % m`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `ans` is still equal to `p`, `s` remains a non-empty string, `strr` is still the last character of `s`, `l` is decremented by 1, and `r` is increased by 2. The updated value of `p` is expressed as `p * arr[r] % m`.
