Output State: **`r` is increased by 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the next character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `p` is updated according to the condition specified, `ans` contains the updated value of `p`.**

Explanation: The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The values of `s`, `strr`, `p`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
