Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `a` is an array of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of n integers obtained from the first two space-separated integers input, `s` is the string input from the user.**

The code `s = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
