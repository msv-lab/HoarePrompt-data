Output State: **`n` is the first integer input - 1, `m` is the second integer input, `input_value` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input split and converted to integers, `s` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), `k` is the first character of the new `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is decremented by 1 if `k` does not equal 'L'**.

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Whether `k` equals 'L' or not, the value of `r` is updated. Since the initial state of `l` is 1 if `k` equals 'L' or 0 if `k` does not equal 'L', and the code only updates `r` based on whether `k` does not equal 'L', `l` remains 0. Therefore, `r` is decremented by 1 if `k` does not equal 'L'.
