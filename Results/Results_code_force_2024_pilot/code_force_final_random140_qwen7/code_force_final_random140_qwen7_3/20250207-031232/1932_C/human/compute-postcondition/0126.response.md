Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `s`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1.
   - If `k` is not equal to 'L', then `r` is decreased by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `k` is the current character being processed in the string `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - The string `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `s` remains a non-empty string.
   - `k` changes to the next character in `s`.
   - If the next character `k` is 'L', then `l` will be 1.
   - If the next character `k` is not 'L', then `r` will be decreased by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `s` remains a non-empty string.
- `k` changes to the next character in `s`.
- `l` will be 1 if the next character `k` is 'L'.
- `r` will be decreased by 1 if the next character `k` is not 'L'.

Since we cannot predict the exact value of `k` without knowing the specific string `s`, we can only state the conditions based on the possible values of `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the next character in `s`, if `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1, if `k` is not 'L', then `r` is decreased by 1.**
