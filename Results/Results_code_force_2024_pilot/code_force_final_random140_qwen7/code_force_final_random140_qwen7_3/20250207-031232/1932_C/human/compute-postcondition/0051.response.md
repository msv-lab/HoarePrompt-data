Postcondition: `p` is now either `p * arr[r] % m` or `p * arr[l] % m` depending on whether the next character from the end of `s` is 'R' or not. `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string `s` adjusted accordingly, `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s` adjusted accordingly. `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values. `ans` contains the value of `p` appended to it. `strr` is the next character from the end of `s`.
