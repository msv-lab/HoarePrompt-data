Output State: **`ans` is equal to `p` appended with the current value of `p`, `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `l` is decremented by 1, and if `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 2 and `p` is equal to `p * arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `s`, `strr`, `l`, `r`, `arr`, or `m`. The conditions related to `strr` and `r` or `l` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state retains the conditions specified in the initial state, with the addition that `ans` now contains `p` appended to its existing values.
