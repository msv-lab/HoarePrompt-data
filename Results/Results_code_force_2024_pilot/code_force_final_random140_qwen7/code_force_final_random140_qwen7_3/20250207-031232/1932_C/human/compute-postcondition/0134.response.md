Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the next character in the string `s`, `r` is `r - 1`, and if `k` is 'L', `l` is 1 more than its previous value.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` becomes `r - 1`. The conditions for `l` remain the same, meaning if `k` is 'L', `l` is 1 more than its previous value. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
