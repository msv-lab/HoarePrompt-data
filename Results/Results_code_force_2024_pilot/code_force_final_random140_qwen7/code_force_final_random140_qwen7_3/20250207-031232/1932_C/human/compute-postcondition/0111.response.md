Output State: `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated according to the conditions specified within the loop for each character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `p` for each iteration of the loop.

In this final state, `s` remains as it was initially because no operation modifies it inside the loop. The variable `p` is continuously updated based on whether the character read from `s[::-1]` is 'R' or not, multiplying `p` by the corresponding element from the list `arr` adjusted by either `r` or `l`, and taking modulo `m`. The list `ans` accumulates these updates, resulting in a list where each element corresponds to the value of `p` after each iteration of the loop.
