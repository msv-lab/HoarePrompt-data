Output State: **`n` is the first integer input - 1, `m` is the second integer input, `input_value` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input split and converted to integers, `s` is an empty string, `k` is undefined, `l` is 0, `r` is -1, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and retains the values of all other variables as they were in the initial state.
