Output State: **`p` is 1, `s` must be a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, and `l` is decreased by 1.**

The code `l -= 1` decrements the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it exists and is decremented. All other variables remain unchanged.
