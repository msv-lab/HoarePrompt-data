Output State: **`p` is 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is 'R', `r` is 1**

The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` was initially not defined, it is assumed to be 0 before this line of code. After executing `r += 1`, the value of `r` becomes 1. All other variables (`p`, `s`, and `strr`) remain unchanged.
