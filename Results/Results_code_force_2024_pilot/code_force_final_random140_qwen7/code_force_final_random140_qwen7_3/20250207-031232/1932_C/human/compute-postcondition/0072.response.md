Output State: **`n` is the first integer input - 1, `m` is the second integer input, `input_value` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input split and converted to integers, `s` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), `k` is the first character of the new `s`, `l` is either 1 if `k` equals 'L' or 0 if `k` does not equal 'L', `r` is decremented by 1 if `k` does not equal 'L'.**

The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. The value of `r` is decremented only if `k` does not equal 'L'. Since the value of `k` is dependent on the first character of the string `s`, which has been shortened by one character, the value of `r` will be decremented by 1 if `k` is not 'L'. The other variables remain unchanged.
