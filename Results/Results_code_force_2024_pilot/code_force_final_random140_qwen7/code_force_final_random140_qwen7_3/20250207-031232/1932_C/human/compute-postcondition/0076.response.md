Output State: **`n` is the first integer input - 1, `m` is the second integer input, `input_value` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input split and converted to integers, `s` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), `k` is the first character of the new `s`, `l` is 2 if `k` equals 'L' or 1 if `k` does not equal 'L', `r` is decremented by 1 if `k` does not equal 'L'**.

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was previously 1 if `k` did not equal 'L' and 0 if `k` equals 'L', incrementing it by 1 results in `l` being 2 if `k` did not equal 'L' and 1 if `k` equals 'L'. The other variables remain unchanged.
