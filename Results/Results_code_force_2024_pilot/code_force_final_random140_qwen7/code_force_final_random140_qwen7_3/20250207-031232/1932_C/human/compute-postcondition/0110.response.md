Output State: `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is the final product of the multiplications based on the characters in the reversed string `s[::-1]` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing all intermediate values of `p` after each iteration of the loop.

In this final state, `s` remains as it was initially because no operations are performed on it within the loop. The variable `p` is the result of multiplying elements from the list `arr` based on the characters read from `s[::-1]` (right to left), taking the modulo `m` at each step. The list `ans` contains all the intermediate results of `p` after each iteration of the loop, starting from the first multiplication up to the last one.
