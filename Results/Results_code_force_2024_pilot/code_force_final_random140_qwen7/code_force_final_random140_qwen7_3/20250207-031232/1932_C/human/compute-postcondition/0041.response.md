Output State: **`p` is either 1 times `arr[r]` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or 1 times `arr[l]` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R'; `l` is `l - 1`; `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s` adjusted accordingly (either unchanged or increased by 1); `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values; `ans` contains the value of `p`; `strr` is the next character from the end of `s`.**

Explanation: The line `l -= 1` decrements the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
