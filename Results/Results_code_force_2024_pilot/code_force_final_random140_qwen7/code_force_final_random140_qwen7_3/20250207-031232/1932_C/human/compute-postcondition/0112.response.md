Based on the initial state described, let's break down the process:

1. **Reversed String `s[::-1]`:** The string `s` is reversed, meaning if `s` was "abc", then `s[::-1]` would be "cba".

2. **Variable `p`:** This variable is updated based on each character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`. If the character is 'R', `p` is multiplied by the corresponding element from the list `arr` adjusted by `r`. If the character is not 'R', `p` is multiplied by the corresponding element from the list `arr` adjusted by `l`.

3. **List `ans`:** This list accumulates the updated values of `p` after each iteration of the loop. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `p` after processing each character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`.

4. **Final Print Statement:** The print statement `print(*ans[::-1])` will print the elements of `ans` in reverse order.

Given that `s` remains unchanged and the exact values of `arr`, `r`, `l`, and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the operations performed.

Output: **the accumulated values of `p` in reverse order, where each value is the result of updating `p` based on the characters in the reversed string `s[::-1]` and the corresponding elements in `arr` adjusted by `r` or `l`, and taking modulo `m`**
