Output State: **`p` is `arr[l] % m`, `s` must be a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, and `l` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is updated to the value of `p * arr[l] % m`. Since `p` was initially 1, the new value of `p` becomes `1 * arr[l] % m`, which simplifies to `arr[l] % m`. The other variables (`s`, `strr`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
