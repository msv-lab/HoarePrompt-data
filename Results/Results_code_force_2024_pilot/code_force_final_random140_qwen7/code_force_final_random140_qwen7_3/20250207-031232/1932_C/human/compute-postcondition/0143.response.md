Output State: **`p` is `arr[1] % m`, `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is 'R', `r` is 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to `p * arr[r] % m`. Given that `r` is 1, `p` is updated to `1 * arr[1] % m`, which simplifies to `arr[1] % m`. The values of `s`, `strr`, and `r` remain unchanged.
