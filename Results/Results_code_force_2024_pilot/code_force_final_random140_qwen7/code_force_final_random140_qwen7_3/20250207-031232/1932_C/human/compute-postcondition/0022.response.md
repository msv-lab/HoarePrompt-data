Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `a` is an array of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^4\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the first two space-separated integers input, `s` is the string input from the user, `l` is either `l + 1` or `l` (depending on whether `k` is 'L' or not), `r` is either `n - 3`, `n - 4`, or `n - 3` (depending on whether `k` is 'L' or not), and `k` is the next character in the string `s`, and `k` is either 'L' or not 'L'. If `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is set to either `n - 3` or `n - 4`.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1, and `r` remains as either `n - 2` or `n - 3`. If `k` is not 'L', `r` is set to either `n - 3` or `n - 4`, and `l` remains unchanged.
