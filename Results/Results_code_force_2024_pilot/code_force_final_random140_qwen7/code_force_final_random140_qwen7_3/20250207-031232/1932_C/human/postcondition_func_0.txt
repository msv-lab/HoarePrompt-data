The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting only of 'L' and 'R'. It calculates a cumulative product \( p \) of elements from the array \( a \) based on the directions given by the string \( s \), taking the result modulo \( m \). The function computes this product both forward and backward through the string \( s \), storing each intermediate value in a list \( ans \). Finally, it prints the reversed list \( ans \) containing all intermediate results.
