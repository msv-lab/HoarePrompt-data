You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `p` will be the final cumulative product of elements from the array `arr` based on the directions given by the string `s`, taken modulo `m`. The list `ans` will contain all the intermediate values of `p` calculated during each iteration of the loop. The variable `s` will be an empty string, `l` will be the total count of 'L' characters in the original string `s`, and `r` will be the total count of 'R' characters in the original string `s`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `arr` will retain their initial values.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after processing all characters in the string `s` (both forward and backward), `p` will hold the final result of the product operations described in the loop, and `ans` will contain the sequence of intermediate results. The counts `l` and `r` will reflect the total occurrences of 'L' and 'R' in the original string `s`, respectively.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the indices `l` and `r` during the iteration over the commands string `s`. This leads to incorrect calculations of the product of the array elements and their remainders when divided by `m`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

The expected output should be:

```
0 2 4 1
```

However, the program's logic for updating `l` and `r` is flawed. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in the program:

1. Initially, `l = 0` and `r = 3`.
2. For the first command `'L'`, `l` is incremented to `1`, but `r` remains `3`.
3. For the second command `'R'`, `r` is decremented to `2`, and the product is updated using `arr[1]`.
4. For the third command `'R'`, `r` is again decremented to `1`, and the product is updated using `arr[1]`.
5. For the fourth command `'L'`, `l` is incremented to `2`, but `r` remains `1`.

This incorrect handling of indices leads to incorrect products being calculated and appended to the result list `ans`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this input, making it incorrect.
