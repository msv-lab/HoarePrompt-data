Reasoning:
Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the necessary variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `p`, and `ans`) for each test case.

2. **Counting 'L' and 'R'**: The first loop counts the occurrences of 'L' and 'R' in the string `s` and adjusts the indices `l` and `r` accordingly. This step is unnecessary for the final solution but is used to verify the counts of 'L' and 'R' in the string `s`.

3. **Reversing the String and Processing**: The second loop processes the string `s` in reverse order. For each character in `s`:
   - If the character is 'R', it increments `r` and updates `p` with the product of the current element and the previous value of `p` modulo `m`.
   - If the character is 'L', it decrements `l` and updates `p` similarly.
   - It appends the updated value of `p` to the list `ans`.

4. **Printing the Result**: The program prints the reversed list `ans`, which contains the intermediate results of the product calculations.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function matches the problem requirements. The function correctly processes each command, updates the product modulo `m`, and stores the intermediate results in the list `ans`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
