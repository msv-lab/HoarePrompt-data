Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes the necessary variables and reads the input as specified.
2. It calculates the indices `l` and `r` for the left and right boundaries of the array based on the string `s`.
3. It then iterates through the string `s` in reverse to calculate the cumulative product of the array elements, taking into account the removal of elements based on the direction ('L' or 'R') indicated by each character in the string.
4. The intermediate results are stored in the list `ans`, which is printed in reverse order at the end to match the required output format.
5. The logic for updating the product `p` and adjusting the indices `l` and `r` is consistent with the problem description.
6. The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as processing multiple test cases and ensuring the array is processed correctly based on the commands.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
