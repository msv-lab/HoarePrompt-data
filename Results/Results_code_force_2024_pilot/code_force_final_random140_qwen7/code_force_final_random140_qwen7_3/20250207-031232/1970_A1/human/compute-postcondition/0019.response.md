Output State: **`positions` is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, char2), `i` is 3, `balance` is either 1 more than its initial value if `char` is '(', or `balance` is decreased by 3 from its initial value if `char` is not '('**.

Explanation: The code `balance -= 1` decrements the value of `balance` by 1. Depending on the value of `char`, which is the third character of `s`, `balance` was either 2 more than its initial value or 2 less than its initial value. After decrementing by 1, if `char` was '(', `balance` is now 1 more than its initial value. If `char` was not '(', `balance` is now 3 less than its initial value. The other variables (`positions`, `i`, and `char`) remain unchanged.
