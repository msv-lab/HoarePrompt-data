Output State: **`positions` is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, char2), `i` is 2, `char` is the second character of `s`, and `balance` is either 2 more than its initial value if `char` is '(', or `balance` is decreased by 2 from its initial value if `char` is not '('.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a tuple `(balance, i, char)` to the list `positions`.
- Initially, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `s`, and `balance` is either 1 more than its initial value if `char` is '(', or `balance` is decreased by 1 from its initial value if `char` is not '('.
- After executing `positions.append((balance, i, char))`, the list `positions` now contains one additional tuple `(balance, i, char)`.
- Since `i` was initially 1 and the code increments `i` by 1, the new value of `i` is 2.
- The value of `balance` remains the same as it was before appending the tuple, which means it is either 2 more than its initial value if `char` is '(', or 2 less than its initial value if `char` is not '('.
- The value of `char` remains the same as it was before appending the tuple, which is the second character of `s`.
