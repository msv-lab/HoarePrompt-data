Output State: **`positions` is a list containing one tuple (balance, 3, char2); `balance` is either 1 more than its initial value if `char` is '(', or `balance` is decreased by 2 from its initial value if `char` is not '('**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple to the list `positions`. The tuple contains the current value of `balance`, the value of `i` which is 3, and the value of `char` which is `char2`. The value of `balance` is updated based on the condition: if `char` is '(', `balance` is increased by 1; otherwise, `balance` is decreased by 2. The initial values of `i` and `char` remain unchanged, and the list `positions` now includes the updated tuple reflecting the new value of `balance`.
