Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 0, `char` is '(', balance is 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the `balance` variable by 1. Initially, `balance` was not specified, but since `char` is '(', which is the first character in the string `s`, we can infer that `balance` was 0 before this operation. After executing `balance += 1`, `balance` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
