Output State: **`positions` is a list containing one tuple (balance-1, 1, char2), `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `s`**

Explanation: The code `balance -= 1` decreases the first element of the only tuple in the `positions` list by 1. The other variables (`i` and `char`) remain unchanged.
