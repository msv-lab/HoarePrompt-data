Output State: **`positions` is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, char2), `i` is 3, `char` is the third character of `s`, `balance` is 1 more than its initial value if `char` is '(', or `balance` is decreased by 1 from its initial value if `char` is not '('**

Explanation: The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. The increment is applied regardless of whether `char` is '(' or not. The other variables (`positions`, `i`, and `char`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
