Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input string `s` and passes it to the function `func_1`.
2. The function `func_1` calculates the balance of the parentheses sequence and stores the balance along with the index and character in a list `positions`.
3. The list `positions` is sorted according to the specified criteria: first by the balance in ascending order, and then by the index in descending order in case of ties.
4. The resulting string is constructed by concatenating the characters from the sorted list `positions`.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the implementation matches the requirements. The function correctly performs the balanced shuffle operation as described.

Correctness: **True**
