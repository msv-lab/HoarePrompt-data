Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input string `s` and passes it to the function `func_1`.
2. In `func_1`, the program calculates the balance for each character in the string and stores it along with the position and character itself in a list `positions`.
3. The list `positions` is then sorted according to the specified criteria: first by the balance in ascending order, and then by the position in descending order within each balance group.
4. Finally, the program constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list and returns it.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` matches the definition of the balanced shuffle operation. Therefore, the program should work as intended for any valid input.

Correctness: **True**
