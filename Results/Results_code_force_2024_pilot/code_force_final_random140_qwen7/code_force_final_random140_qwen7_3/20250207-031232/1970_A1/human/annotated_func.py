#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: positions is a list containing tuples (balance, i, char) for each character in the string s, where balance is the net count of '(' minus ')' up to that index, i is the index of the current character, and char is the character at that index.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string composed of characters from the third element of each tuple in `positions`, ordered by the original sorting criteria of `balance` and `-i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" characters, representing a balanced parentheses sequence. It processes this string by tracking the balance of parentheses and their positions, sorts the results based on the balance and index, and finally returns a new string composed of the characters from the sorted tuples.
