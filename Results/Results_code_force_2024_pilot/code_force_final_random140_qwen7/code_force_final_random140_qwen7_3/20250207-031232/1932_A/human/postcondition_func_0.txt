The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a string of \( n \) characters ('.', '@', '*'). For each test case, it counts the number of '@' characters in the string, breaking the count if two consecutive '*' characters are encountered. The function outputs the count for each test case.
