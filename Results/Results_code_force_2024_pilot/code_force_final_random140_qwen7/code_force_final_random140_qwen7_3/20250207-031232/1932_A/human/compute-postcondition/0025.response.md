Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `s`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least one character.
   - `i` is the first character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` is either 2 or 0.
   - If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 1.
   - If `i` is '*', `thorn` is 2; otherwise, `thorn` is 0.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first character in the list `s`, after processing `i`, `i` will be removed from `s` (or shifted to the next position).
   - Therefore, `s` will now contain all characters except the first one.
   - `i` will now be the second character in the updated list `s`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `s` will now be a list of characters with at least one character (since it had at least one character before and one was removed).
   - `i` will now be the second character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` remains unchanged unless `i` changes to '@' or '*'. Since we are only shifting to the next character, `thorn` will remain the same as its value based on the current `i`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the second character in the list `s`, `thorn` is either 2 or 0. If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is 2; otherwise, `thorn` is 0.**
