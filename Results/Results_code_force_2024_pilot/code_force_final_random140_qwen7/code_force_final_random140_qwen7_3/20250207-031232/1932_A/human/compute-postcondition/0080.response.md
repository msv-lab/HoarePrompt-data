Postcondition: **`len(s)` must be at least 4, `s` is an iterable with at least 5 elements, `i` is the 5th element of `s`, `thorn` is either 1 or 3 depending on the value of `i`, and `ret` is the same as the previous iteration. If `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
