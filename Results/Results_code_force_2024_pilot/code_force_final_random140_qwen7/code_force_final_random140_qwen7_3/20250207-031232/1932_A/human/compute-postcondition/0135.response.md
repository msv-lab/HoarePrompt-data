Postcondition: `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least one character, `ret` is 1, `thorn` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `i == '*'` is met, and `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i == '*'`, then `thorn` is set to 2, otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.
