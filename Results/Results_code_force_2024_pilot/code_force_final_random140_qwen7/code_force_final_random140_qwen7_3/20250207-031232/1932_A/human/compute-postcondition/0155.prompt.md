You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of n characters consisting only of '.', '@', and '*', where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. Additionally, the first cell is guaranteed to be empty ('.') and does not contain thorns.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        len = int(input())
        
        s = list(input())
        
        ret = 0
        
        thorn = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == '@':
                thorn = 0
                ret += 1
            elif i == '*':
                thorn += 1
                if thorn == 2:
                    break
            else:
                thorn = 0
        
        print(ret)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `ret` will contain the total count of '@' characters encountered in the string `s`. The variable `thorn` will be 0, as the loop breaks when `thorn` reaches 2, resetting it back to 0. The variable `i` will be the last character processed in the string `s`, and `len` will be the length of the final string `s` after any necessary adjustments within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data through multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines of input. Each line starts with a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating the number of cells, followed by a string of n characters ('.', '@', '*') representing the cells. The function returns a string for each test case indicating the result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
