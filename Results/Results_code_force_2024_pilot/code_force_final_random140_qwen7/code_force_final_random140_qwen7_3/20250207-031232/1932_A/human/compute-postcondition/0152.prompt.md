Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of n characters consisting only of '.', '@', and '*', where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. Additionally, the first cell is guaranteed to be empty ('.') and does not contain thorns.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn = 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has executed for as many times as there are elements in the list `s`. The variable `ret` contains the count of '@' characters encountered in `s`. The variable `thorn` is either 0 or 1, depending on the last character processed in `s`. If the last character was not '*', `thorn` will be 0. If the last character was '*', and it caused `thorn` to reach 2 and exit the loop, `thorn` will be 0. If the last character was '@', `thorn` will be 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has gone through each character in the iterable `s` until the end. At this point, the variable `ret` will hold the total count of '@' characters encountered in `s`, and `thorn` will be 0 because the loop breaks when `thorn` reaches 2, which would reset `thorn` back to 0. The exact values of `ret` and `thorn` depend on the content of `s`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is: `s` has been fully iterated over, `ret` contains the total count of '@' characters in `s`, and `thorn` is reset to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with fewer characters than the original length, `ret` is the total count of '@' characters encountered in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0 unless a '*' character was encountered twice consecutively, in which case `thorn` is 2, and `i` is the last character processed in the list `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
