Output State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least one character, `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 1, `i` is the second character in the list `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. All other variables retain their previous values.
