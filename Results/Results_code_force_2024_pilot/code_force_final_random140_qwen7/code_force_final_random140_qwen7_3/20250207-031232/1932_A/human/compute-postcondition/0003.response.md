Output State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `ret`. This does not affect the values of `len` or `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `len` and `s`, while `ret` is explicitly set to 0.
