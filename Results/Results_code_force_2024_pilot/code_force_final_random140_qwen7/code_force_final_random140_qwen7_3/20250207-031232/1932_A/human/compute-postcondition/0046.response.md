Postcondition: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the third character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is either incremented by 1 based on the value of the third character in the list `s` or reset to 0. If `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `thorn` remains unchanged.**
