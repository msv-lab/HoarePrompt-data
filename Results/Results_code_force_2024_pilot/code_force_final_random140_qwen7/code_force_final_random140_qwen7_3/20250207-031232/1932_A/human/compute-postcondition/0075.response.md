Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `len(s)` must be at least 4.
   - `s` is an iterable with at least 4 elements.
   - `i` has taken on the first 4 elements of `s`.
   - If `i` is '@', `thorn` is 0 and `ret` is 1.
   - If `i` is not '@' and equals '*', `thorn` is set to 2.
   - If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` remains 0.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each element in `s` using the variable `i`.

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `s` must be processed. Since `i` has taken on the first 4 elements of `s`, the next element will be the 5th element of `s`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i`: Will now be the 5th element of `s`.
   - `thorn`: The value of `thorn` will depend on the value of `i` (whether it is '@', '*', or neither).
   - `ret`: This variable is not directly affected by the loop, so its value remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `i` will now be the 5th element of `s`.
- `thorn` will be updated based on the value of `i` (as per the given conditions).
- `ret` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`len(s)` must be at least 4, `s` is an iterable with at least 5 elements, `i` is the 5th element of `s`, `thorn` is either 0 or 2 depending on the value of `i`, and `ret` is the same as the previous iteration.**
