Output State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least one character, `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the second character in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0**.

The value of `thorn` is explicitly set to 0, so it overrides its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
