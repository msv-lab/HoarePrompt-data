Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` from the list `s`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the list `s` to iterate over.

3. **Analyze the given postcondition**:
   - `s` is a list of characters with at least one character.
   - `i` is the second character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` is either 1, 3, or 0 based on the value of `i`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second character in the list `s`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be the third character in the list `s` (because the loop will increment `i`).
   - Therefore, `s` must have at least three characters to allow `i` to become the third character.
   - The value of `thorn` will depend on what the third character (`i`) is, but since we don't know the exact value yet, we keep the possible values for `thorn` as 1, 3, or 0.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `s` is a list of characters with at least three characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is either 1, 3, or 0.**
