Postcondition: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the third character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is `thorn` + 1 based on the value of the third character in the list `s`. If `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `thorn` does not equal 2, no change occurs to `thorn`.
