Output State: **`len` must be at least 4, `s` is an iterable with at least 4 elements, `i` has taken on the first 4 elements of `s`, and the current value of `i` is '@', `thorn` is 0, `ret` is 1**.

The code `ret += 1` increments the value of `ret` by 1. Since `ret` was initially 0, after executing this line, `ret` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
