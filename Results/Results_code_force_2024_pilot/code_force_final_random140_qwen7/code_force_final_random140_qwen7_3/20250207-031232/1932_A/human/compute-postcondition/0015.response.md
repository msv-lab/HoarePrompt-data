Output State: **`thorn` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least one character, `i` is the first character in the list `s` and is not '@', and the current value of `i` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
