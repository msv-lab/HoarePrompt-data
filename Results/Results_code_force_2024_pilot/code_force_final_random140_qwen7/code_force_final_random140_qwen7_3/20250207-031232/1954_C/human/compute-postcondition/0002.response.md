Output State: **`x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string**.

The code `a = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `a`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
