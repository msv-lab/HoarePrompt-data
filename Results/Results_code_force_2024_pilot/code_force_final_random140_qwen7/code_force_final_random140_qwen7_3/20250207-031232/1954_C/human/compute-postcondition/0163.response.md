Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string based on the minimum or maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with `a[i]` and further concatenated with either `a[i]` or another string based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. `kq2` is a string based on the maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with the string representations of `x` (minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`) and `y` (maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`). Depending on the condition, `kq2` is either updated by appending `a[i]` or a string representation of `x` or `y` to its current value.**
