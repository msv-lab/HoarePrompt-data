Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `kq1` is the string `a[1]`**.

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` attempts to concatenate the character at index `i` of the string `a` to the string `kq1`. Given that `i` is 1, `kq1` will be updated to include the character at index 1 of `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty string, `kq1` will become the string formed by concatenating `kq1` (which was initially an empty string or possibly another string) with the character at index 1 of `a`. Variables `i` and `a` remain unchanged.
