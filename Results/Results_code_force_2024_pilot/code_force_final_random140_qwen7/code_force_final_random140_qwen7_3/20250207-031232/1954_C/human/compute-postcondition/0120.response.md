Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(len(a))`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `i = len(a) - 1`.

3. **Understand the Range Function**: The `range(len(a))` function generates a sequence of numbers from `0` to `len(a) - 1`. Therefore, the loop will iterate over these values.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range generated by `range(len(a))`. Given that `i` starts at `len(a) - 1`, the loop will run as long as `i` is non-negative (i.e., `i >= 0`).

5. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range for the loop to execute. Since `i` starts at `len(a) - 1`, we need to ensure that `len(a) - 1` is non-negative. This means `len(a)` must be at least 1.

6. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`kq1`, `kq2`, `x`, `y`, and `vt`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)` must be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`len(a)` must be at least 1**
