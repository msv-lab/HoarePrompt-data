Postcondition: **`i` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is 1, then `kq2` is `kq2 + a[0]`, `kq1` is `a[0] + a[i]`, and `x` and `y` are not modified. If `i` is 0, then `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `kq1` and `kq2` are updated according to the value of `vt`: if `vt` is 1, then `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y`; otherwise, `kq1` is the string `y` concatenated with itself, and `kq2` is the string `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
