Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, and the element at index `i` of `a` is less than or equal to the element at index `i` of `b`; `x` is the minimum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`; regardless of the value of `vt`, `kq1` is a string that contains either the string representation of `x` or `y`, and `kq2` is a string that contains either the string representation of `y` or `x` depending on the value of `vt`.**
