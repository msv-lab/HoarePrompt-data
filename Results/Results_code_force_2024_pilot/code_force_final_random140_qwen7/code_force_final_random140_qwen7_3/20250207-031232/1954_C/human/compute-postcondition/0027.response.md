Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `i` is 1, then `kq1` is equal to the character at index 0 of `a`, `kq2` is equal to `kq2 + a[1]`, `i` is 1, and `a` is a non-empty string. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `i` is 0, then `a[0]` is not equal to `b[0]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` if `vt` is 1, otherwise `kq1` is a string containing the value of `y` appended to it, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `x` appended to it if `vt` is 1, otherwise `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` appended to it.
