Output State: **`i` is 2, `kq1` is `kq1 + str(a[0] + a[2])`, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[2] + a[i]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop continues. Therefore, the values of `i`, `kq1`, `kq2`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the loop continues.
