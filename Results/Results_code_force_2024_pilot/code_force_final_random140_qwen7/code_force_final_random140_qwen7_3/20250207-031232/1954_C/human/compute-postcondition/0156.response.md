Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string based on the minimum or maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with `a[i]`, and `kq2` is a string based on the maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with the string representations of `x` and `y`, where `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `x` and `y` are calculated from the current values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the values of `x` and `y` have been calculated based on the minimum and maximum of the elements at the new index `i` of lists `a` and `b`. The strings `kq1` and `kq2` are updated accordingly using these values.
