Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string based on the minimum or maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with `a[i]` and then further concatenated with `a[i]` again, `kq2` is a string based on the maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with the string representations of `x` and `y`, where `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq2` is now `kq2 + a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `a[i]` to `kq2`. Since `a[i]` is an integer from the list `a`, `kq2` is updated by concatenating `a[i]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state description.
