Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, and either `kq1` and `kq2` are strings where `kq1` is the string `a[1]` and `kq2` is the string `a[1] + a[1]`, or `kq1` is a string containing the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])` appended to it, and `kq2` is a string containing the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])` appended to it, depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]` or not.
