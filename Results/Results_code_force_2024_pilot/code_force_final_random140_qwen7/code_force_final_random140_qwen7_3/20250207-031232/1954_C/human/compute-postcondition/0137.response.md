Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists. `kq1` is a string that contains either the string representation of the minimum or maximum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` is a string that contains either the string representation of the maximum or minimum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`, depending on the value of `vt`. If the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated accordingly, and the loop continues with the next iteration.
