Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `kq1` is updated based on the value of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `kq1` is `kq1 + str(a[0] + a[2]) + str(a[2]) + a[2]`. Otherwise, `kq1` is updated to either `kq1 + str(int(a[0])) + str(x) + str(y) + str(a[2])` or `kq1 + str(a[0]) + str(y) + str(x) + str(a[2])` depending on the value of `vt`. `kq2` is updated to either `kq2 + str(y) + str(a[2])` or `kq2 + str(x) + str(a[2])` depending on the value of `vt`. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`.**
