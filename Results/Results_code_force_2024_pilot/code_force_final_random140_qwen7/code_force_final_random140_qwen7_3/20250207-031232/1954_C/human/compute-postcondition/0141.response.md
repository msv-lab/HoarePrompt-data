The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq1`, and `kq2` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect their values.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists and equals `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string that contains the string representation of the minimum or maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the element `a[i]`, and `kq2` is a string that contains the string representation of the element at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` plus the element `a[i]`.**
