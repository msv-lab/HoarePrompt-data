Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(int(a[0])) + str(x) + str(y) + str(a[2])` if `vt` is 0, otherwise it is updated to `kq1 + str(a[0]) + str(y) + str(x) + str(a[2])`. `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(y) + str(a[2])` if `vt` is 0, otherwise it is updated to `kq2 + str(x) + str(a[2])`. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`.**
