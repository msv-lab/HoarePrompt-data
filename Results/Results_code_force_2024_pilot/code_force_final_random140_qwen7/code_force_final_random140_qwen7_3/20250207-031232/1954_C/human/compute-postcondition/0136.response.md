Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists. `kq1` and `kq2` are strings. If the element at index `i` of `a` is equal to the element at index `i` of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` remain unchanged from their previous values (which are the sum of corresponding elements). Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`. Depending on the value of `vt`, `kq1` contains the string representation of `x` or `y`, and `kq2` contains the string representation of `y` or `x`.
