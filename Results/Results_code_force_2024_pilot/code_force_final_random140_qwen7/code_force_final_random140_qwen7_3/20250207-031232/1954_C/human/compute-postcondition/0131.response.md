Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, and the element at index `i` of `a` is less than or equal to the element at index `i` of `b`; `x` is the minimum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x`; `kq2` is a string containing the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `y`.**

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` concatenates the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq2`. Since `kq2` was not initialized before, it is assumed to be an empty string (`''`). Therefore, `kq2` now contains the string representation of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
