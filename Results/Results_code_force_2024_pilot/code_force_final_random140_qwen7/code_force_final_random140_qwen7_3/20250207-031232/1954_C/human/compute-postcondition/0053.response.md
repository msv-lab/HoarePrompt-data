Postcondition: `i` is 2; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is a string; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; if `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` as a string appended to its current value, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` as a string appended to its current value. Otherwise, `kq1` is an empty string concatenated with `str(y)`, resulting in `str(y)`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `str(x)` appended to its end.
