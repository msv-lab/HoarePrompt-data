Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `kq1` is equal to the character at index 0 of `a`, and `kq2` is equal to `kq2 + a[1]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of `i`, `a`, `kq1`, or `kq2`.
