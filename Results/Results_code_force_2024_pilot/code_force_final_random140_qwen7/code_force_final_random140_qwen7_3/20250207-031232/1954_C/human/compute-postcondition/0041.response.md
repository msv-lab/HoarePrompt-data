Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, and based on the condition `a[i] == b[i]`, either `kq1` is the string `a[1]`, `kq2` is the string `a[1] + a[1]`, and the loop continues, or `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` appended to it, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` appended to it if `vt` is 0, otherwise `kq1` is a string containing `str(y)` appended to it, and `kq2` is an empty string concatenated with `str(x)`.
