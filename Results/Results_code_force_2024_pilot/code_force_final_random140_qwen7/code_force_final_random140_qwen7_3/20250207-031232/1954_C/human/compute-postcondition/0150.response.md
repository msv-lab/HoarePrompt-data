Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists and equals `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string that contains either the string representation of the minimum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the element `a[i]`, or the string representation of the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the element `a[i]`, and `kq2` is a string that contains either the string representation of the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the element `a[i]`, or the string representation of the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the element `a[i]`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated according to the equality. Otherwise, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, where `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.
