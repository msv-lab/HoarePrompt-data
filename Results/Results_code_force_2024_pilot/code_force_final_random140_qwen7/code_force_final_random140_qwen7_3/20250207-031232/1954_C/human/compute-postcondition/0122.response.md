Output State: **`kq1` is `kq1 + a[i]`, the value of `a[i]` is equal to the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` increments the value of `kq1` by the value of `a[i]`. The value of `a[i]` is equal to the value of `b[i]` according to the initial state, but since `kq1` is being updated, we express the new value of `kq1` as `kq1 + a[i]`. The condition that `len(a)` is at least 1 remains valid, and the equality between `a[i]` and `b[i]` is preserved.
