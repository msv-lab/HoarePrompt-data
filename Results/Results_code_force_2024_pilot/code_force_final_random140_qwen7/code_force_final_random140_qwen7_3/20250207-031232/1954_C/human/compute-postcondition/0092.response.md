Output State: **`i` is 1, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[0]` if `i` was 0, `kq1` is `a[0] + a[i]` if `i` was 0, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1, `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(y)`**.

Explanation: The variable `kq2` is updated by adding the string representation of `y` to its current value. Since `i` is 1, the conditions for updating `kq1` and `kq2` based on `i` being 0 do not apply. The values of `x`, `y`, `vt`, and `kq1` remain unchanged. The value of `kq2` is now the sum of its original value and the string representation of `y`.
