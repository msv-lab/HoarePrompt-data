Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, and the element at index `i` of `a` is less than or equal to the element at index `i` of `b`; `x` is the minimum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`; `kq1` is a string that has been appended with the string representation of `y`.**

In this case, the code `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to `kq1`. Since `y` is the maximum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`, `kq1` now contains `kq1` concatenated with the string form of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
