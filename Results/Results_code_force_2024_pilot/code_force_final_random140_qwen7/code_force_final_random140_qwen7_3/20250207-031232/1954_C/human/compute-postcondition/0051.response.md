Output State: **`i` is 2; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is a string; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `kq1` is a string containing the value of `str(y)` appended to its end; `kq2` is an empty string concatenated with `str(x)`, resulting in `str(x)`**.

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` concatenates the string `str(x)` to `kq2`. Since `kq2` was initially an empty string, after executing the code, `kq2` becomes `str(x)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
