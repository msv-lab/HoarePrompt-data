Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists and equals `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string that now contains the string representation of the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the string representation of the maximum (`y`), and `kq2` is a string that contains the string representation of the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**

In more detail, the code appends the string representation of `y` (which is the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`) to the existing string `kq1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
