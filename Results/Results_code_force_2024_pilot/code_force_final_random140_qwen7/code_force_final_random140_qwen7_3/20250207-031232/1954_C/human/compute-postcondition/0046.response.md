Output State: **`i` is 2; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is a string; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `x` the minimum value between `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, and `y` the maximum value between `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. The values of `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
