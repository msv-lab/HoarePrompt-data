Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `a` is a non-empty string.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was used in the condition `i < len(a)`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `1` (assuming it was `0` in the previous iteration).
   - The length of `a` remains unchanged, so `a` must still be a non-empty string.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `1`.
   - `a` must remain a non-empty string.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string**
