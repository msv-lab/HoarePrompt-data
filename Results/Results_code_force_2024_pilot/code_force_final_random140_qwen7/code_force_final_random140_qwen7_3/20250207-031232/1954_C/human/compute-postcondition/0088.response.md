The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables `i`, `kq1`, `kq2`, `x`, `y`, and `vt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `kq1` is `a[0] + a[i] + a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[i]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `vt` is not mentioned and remains unchanged.**
