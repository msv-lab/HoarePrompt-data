Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the bounds of the list `a`. This means `i < len(a)`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists and equals `i + 1`.
   - `kq1` is a string based on the minimum or maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with `a[i]`.
   - `kq2` is a string based on the maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with the string representations of `x` and `y`, where `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < len(a)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **New State**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `kq1` and `kq2` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string based on the minimum or maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with `a[i]`, and `kq2` is a string based on the maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with the string representations of `x` and `y`, where `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**
