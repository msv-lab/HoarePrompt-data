Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `kq1` is the string `a[1]`, `kq2` is the string `a[1] + a[1]`**

Explanation: The code attempts to concatenate `a[i]` to `kq2`. However, `kq2` is initially undefined (or could be considered as an empty string), so it effectively starts as an empty string. Given that `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the second character of the string `a`, which is also assigned to `kq1`. Therefore, `kq2` becomes the concatenation of an empty string and `a[1]`, resulting in `kq2` being `a[1]` repeated once.
