Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`**.

This means that the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, `a` remains a non-empty string, and `x` and `y` are assigned the minimum and maximum values of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, respectively.
