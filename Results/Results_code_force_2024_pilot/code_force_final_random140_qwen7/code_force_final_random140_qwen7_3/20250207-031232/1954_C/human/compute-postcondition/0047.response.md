Output State: **`i` is 2; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is a string; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `vt` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `vt`. None of the other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
