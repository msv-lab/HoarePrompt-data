Given the initial state where all characters from string `a` are appended to `kq1` and `kq2` alternately, let's break down the process:

1. Suppose `a` is a string with characters `a1, a2, a3, ..., an`.
2. We need to alternate appending these characters to `kq1` and `kq2`.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

- If `a = "abcde"`, then:
  - `kq1` would receive the odd-indexed characters: `"bdf"` (assuming 0-based indexing).
  - `kq2` would receive the even-indexed characters: `"ace"`.

In general, if `a` has an odd number of characters, the last character will go into `kq2`. If `a` has an even number of characters, the last character will go into `kq1`.

Since the exact content of `a` is not specified, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **"the string kq2, which contains the even-indexed characters of the original string a"**
