Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, and the element at index `i` of `a` is less than or equal to the element at index `i` of `b`; `x` is the minimum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`; `kq1` is a string that has been appended with the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is a string that has been appended with the string representation of `x`.**

In this case, the code `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` to `kq2`. Since `x` is the minimum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `kq1` was previously appended with the string representation of `y`, the output state includes the updated value of `kq2`.
