Output State: **`i` is 2; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is a string; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` as a string appended to its current value; `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` as a string appended to its current value.**

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq2`. Since `kq2` was not initialized before this line, it is implicitly initialized to an empty string (`''`). Thus, `kq2` now contains the string representation of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
