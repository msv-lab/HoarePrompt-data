Based on the initial state, `kq1` and `kq2` are constructed by appending characters from string `a` alternately. Let's break down the process:

1. Initialize `kq1` and `kq2` as empty strings.
2. Iterate through each character in string `a`.
3. For each character, append it to `kq1` if the index is odd, or to `kq2` if the index is even.

For example, if `a = "abcde"`, the process would be:
- Index 0 (even): Append 'a' to `kq2` -> `kq2 = 'a'`
- Index 1 (odd): Append 'b' to `kq1` -> `kq1 = 'b'`
- Index 2 (even): Append 'c' to `kq2` -> `kq2 = 'ac'`
- Index 3 (odd): Append 'd' to `kq1` -> `kq1 = 'bd'`
- Index 4 (even): Append 'e' to `kq2` -> `kq2 = 'ace'`

After processing all characters, `kq1` will contain the characters at odd indices of `a`.

Given this, the output of the print statement `print(kq1)` will be the string composed of characters at odd indices of `a`.

Output: **[characters at odd indices of a]**
