Postcondition: `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `cut` is 2, `_` is `k + 1`, the last element of `a` is '1', and the element immediately following the last element of `a` is '0'. This is because if `a[i] == '1'` and `a[i + 1] == '0'`, then `cut` is set to 2. There is no change in the other conditions as there is no else part provided.
