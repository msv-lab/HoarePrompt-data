Output State: `i` is `-1`, `cut` is a value between 0 (inclusive) and the length of `a` (exclusive), and `_` is `k + 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be set to `-1` because the loop decrements `i` from `len(a) - 1` until it no longer satisfies the condition `i < len(a) - 1`. The variable `cut` will hold the total count of occurrences where an element is '1' followed by an element '0'. This count can range from 0 to the length of `a`, as each iteration increments `cut` by 1 when the specified condition is met. The variable `_` remains unchanged and is equal to `k + 1`.
