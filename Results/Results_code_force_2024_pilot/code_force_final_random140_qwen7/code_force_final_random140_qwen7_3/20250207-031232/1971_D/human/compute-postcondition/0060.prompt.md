Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and all other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a = input()
    cut = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
            cut += 1
    print(cut + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `a` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 2, `cut` is equal to the total number of occurrences where the characters at indices `i` and `i + 1` in string `a` are '1' and '0' respectively, and `i` is `len(a) - 2`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged (still a positive integer between 1 and 500), the string `a` remains the same, and the variable `cut` is updated to reflect the total count of adjacent pairs '10' found in the string `a`. The variable `i` will be set to `len(a) - 2` because the loop increments `i` at the end of each iteration and stops when `i` reaches `len(a) - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final value of `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `cut` is the total number of times `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0' for all valid `i` in the range of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `-1`, `cut` is a value between 0 (inclusive) and the length of `a` (exclusive), and `_` is `k + 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be set to `-1` because the loop decrements `i` from `len(a) - 1` until it no longer satisfies the condition `i < len(a) - 1`. The variable `cut` will hold the total count of occurrences where an element is '1' followed by an element '0'. This count can range from 0 to the length of `a`, as each iteration increments `cut` by 1 when the specified condition is met. The variable `_` remains unchanged and is equal to `k + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
