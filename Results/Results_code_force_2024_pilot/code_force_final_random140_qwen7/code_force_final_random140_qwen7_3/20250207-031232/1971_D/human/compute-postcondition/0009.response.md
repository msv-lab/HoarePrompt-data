Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500.
   - `a` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 2.
   - `cut` is 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The current value of `a[i]` is '1'.
   - The current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `len(a) - 2`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `1`.

5. **Conditions Check**:
   - We need to ensure that the conditions for the next iteration are met.
   - The condition `a[i] == '1'` should hold true for `i = 1`.
   - The condition `a[i + 1] == '0'` should also hold true for `i = 1`.

6. **State Adjustment**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `cut` remains unchanged.
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `a` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 2, `cut` is 1, `i` is 1**.
