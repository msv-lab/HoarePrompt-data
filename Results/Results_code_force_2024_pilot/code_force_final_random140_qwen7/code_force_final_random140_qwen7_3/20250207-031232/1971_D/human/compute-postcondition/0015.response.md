Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `a` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 2, `cut` is 3, `i` is 2. If the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and having a length of 2 is "10", then `cut` is set to 3. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `a`, `cut`, and `i` remain unchanged.
