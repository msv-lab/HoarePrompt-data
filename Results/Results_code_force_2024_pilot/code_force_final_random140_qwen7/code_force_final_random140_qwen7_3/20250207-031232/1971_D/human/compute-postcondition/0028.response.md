Postcondition: `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, and `cut` is increased by 1 if the last element of `a` is '1' and the element right after the last element of `a` is '0'. If the condition `a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0'` is not met, the values of `i`, `len(a)`, and `cut` remain unchanged.
