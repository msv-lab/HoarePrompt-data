Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `a` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 2, `cut` is 1, and `i` is 0, provided that the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'. If these conditions are not met, the values of `t`, `a`, `cut`, and `i` remain as they were before the if-else block executed.
