Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cuts required to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string.
2. The logic implemented in the program is to iterate through the string and count the number of positions where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0'. Each such position indicates a necessary cut to ensure that all '0's come before all '1's when the pieces are rearranged.
3. The program correctly increments the `cut` variable whenever it finds a '1' followed by a '0'.
4. After counting these positions, the program prints `cut + 1` because the final piece will contain the remaining part of the string after the last '1' or before the first '0', depending on the string's composition.
5. The program handles all test cases correctly according to the example provided.

Given this analysis, the program logic matches the problem description and produces the correct results for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
