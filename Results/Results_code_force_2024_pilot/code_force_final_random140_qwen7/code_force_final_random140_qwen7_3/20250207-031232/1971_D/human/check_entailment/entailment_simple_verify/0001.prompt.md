You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        print(cut + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500, inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        
        print(cut + 1)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` is `-1`, `cut` holds the total count of occurrences where an element is '1' followed by an element '0' in the string `a`, and `_` is `t` (the number of times the outer loop ran).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of cuts required to split the binary string into pieces such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (i.e., all '0's before all '1's).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `a`.
   - It initializes a counter `cut` to zero.
   - It iterates through the string and checks if there is a transition from '1' to '0'. If such a transition is found, it increments the `cut` counter.
   - Finally, it prints `cut + 1`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in the loop correctly identifies positions where a '1' is followed by a '0', indicating a necessary cut.
   - However, the solution does not account for the possibility of multiple '1's followed by multiple '0's. In such cases, a single cut might suffice, but the current implementation would count each transition separately.
   - The solution assumes that each transition from '1' to '0' requires a separate cut, which is not always true. For example, in the string "111000", only one cut is needed, but the current logic would count three transitions and thus output 4.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we should count the number of '1's before the first '0' appears. This gives us the number of pieces needed because all '0's will be in one piece and all '1's will be in another piece.
   - Alternatively, we can simply check if the string is already sorted. If it is, no cuts are needed. Otherwise, we need at least one cut.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it overcounts the number of cuts needed. Therefore, the provided program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
