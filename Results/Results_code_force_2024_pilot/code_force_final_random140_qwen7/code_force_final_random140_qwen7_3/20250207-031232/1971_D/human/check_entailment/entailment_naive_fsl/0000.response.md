Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. For example, consider the input `1010`. According to the problem description, the correct answer should be 2 (we can cut after the first '1' and after the second '0'), but the program will output 1 because it only counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0'. This approach fails to account for the optimal way to cut the string.
