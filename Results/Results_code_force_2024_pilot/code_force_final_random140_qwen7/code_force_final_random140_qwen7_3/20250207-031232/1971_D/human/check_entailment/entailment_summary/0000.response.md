Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by counting the number of positions where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the binary string. The logic is that each such position indicates a natural boundary for cutting the string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. **Edge Cases Not Considered**: The current logic does not handle cases where the entire string is already sorted or where the string has no '1's or '0's in the specified pattern.
2. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The logic increments `cut` every time it finds a '1' followed by a '0'. This is not always correct because:
   - If the string starts with '1' and ends with '0', it should be counted as one piece.
   - If the string is entirely '0's or '1's, it should be counted as one piece.
   - The logic does not account for the possibility that the string might have multiple '1's followed by '0's but still be possible to sort with fewer cuts.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly determine the minimum number of pieces required for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
