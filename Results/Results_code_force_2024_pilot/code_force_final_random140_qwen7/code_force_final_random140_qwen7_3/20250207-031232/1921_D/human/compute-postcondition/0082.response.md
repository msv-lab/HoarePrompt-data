Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif3`**

Explanation: The value of `a2` is decremented by 1, so `a2` is now `a2 - 1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or expressions. Therefore, `dif3` and `dif4` are recalculated with `a2` being `a2 - 1`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged from its previous state, which was `ans + dif3`.
