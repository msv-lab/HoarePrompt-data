Based on the initial state provided, the `ans` variable holds the cumulative sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration of the loop. The loop terminates when `a1` exceeds `a2`, and `b1` remains either 0, 1, or 2, indicating the index in list `b` that was most frequently compared with elements in list `a`.

Given the information, the exact value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` during each iteration. However, we know that `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `ans`, which is the cumulative sum of the maximum differences found during the iterations of the loop.

Output: **ans (where ans is the cumulative sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration of the loop)**
