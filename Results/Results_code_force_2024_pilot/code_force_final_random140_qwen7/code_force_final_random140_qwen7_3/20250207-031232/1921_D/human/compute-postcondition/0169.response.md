Output State: **`b1` is 0, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is 0, `b` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to `b1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `b1` while keeping the rest of the variables as they were initially.
