Output State: `b1` is either 0 or `m-1`, `t` is equal to `t - i` where `i` is the total number of iterations, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences found during each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `a1` will always be 0 because the loop continues as long as `a1 <= a2`, and `a2` is only decremented when certain conditions are met, eventually reaching 0. Similarly, `b1` will either be 0 or `m-1` because the loop increments `b1` under certain conditions but does not decrement it unless `a2` is also decremented, which happens only when `a2` is not 0. The variable `t` decreases by 1 for each iteration, so after `i` iterations, `t` will be `t - i`. The value of `ans` will be the sum of the maximum absolute differences found during each iteration, as the loop updates `ans` based on the maximum of the calculated differences. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
