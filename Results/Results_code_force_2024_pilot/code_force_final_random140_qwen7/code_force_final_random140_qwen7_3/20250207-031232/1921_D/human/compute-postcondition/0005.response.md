Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
