Postcondition: **`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4` are the absolute differences as defined. If `dif3` is greater than `dif1`, then `a2` is decremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by `dif3`, and `b1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `dif1`, and `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1+1]`.**
