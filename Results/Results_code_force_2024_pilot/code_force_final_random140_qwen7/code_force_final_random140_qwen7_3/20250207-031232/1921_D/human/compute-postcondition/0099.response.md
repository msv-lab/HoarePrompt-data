Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif3`**.

Explanation: The variable `a2` is decremented by 1. Since `a2` was previously used in the calculation of `dif3` and `dif4`, these values are now updated to reflect the new value of `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
