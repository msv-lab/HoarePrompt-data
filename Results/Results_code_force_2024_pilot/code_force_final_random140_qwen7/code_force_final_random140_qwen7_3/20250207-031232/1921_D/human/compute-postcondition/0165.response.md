Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `b2` is 0, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences found during each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `b1`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `b2`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
