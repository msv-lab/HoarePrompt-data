Output State: **`b1` is either 1 or 2, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `b2` is an index within the range of `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is increased by `dif3` by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `b1` is incremented by 1. Since `b1` was either 0, 1, or 2, after incrementing, `b1` will now be either 1 or 2 (if it was 0) or remain 2 (if it was 1 or 2). All other variables retain their initial conditions and values.
