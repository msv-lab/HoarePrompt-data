Output State: **`t` is now `t-1`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration of the loop, with the loop terminating when `a1` exceeds `a2`.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial conditions. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 is still valid, but now `t` is `t-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
