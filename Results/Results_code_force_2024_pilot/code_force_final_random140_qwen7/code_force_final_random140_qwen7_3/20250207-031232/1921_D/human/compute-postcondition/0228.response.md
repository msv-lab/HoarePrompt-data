Output State: **`b1` is 0; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 2`; `b2` is `m - 1`; `b` is a list of integers; `ans` is `dif4`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[m-1]; `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`, and the condition `dif4 > dif2` is true.**

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decreases the value of `a2` by 1. Initially, `a2` was `n - 1`. After decrementing, `a2` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
