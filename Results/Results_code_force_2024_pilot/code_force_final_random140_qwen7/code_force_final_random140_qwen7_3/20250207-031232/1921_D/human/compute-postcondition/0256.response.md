Output State: **`b1` is either 1 or 2; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is increased by 1 and must now be less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is `ans` plus `dif1`.**

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. Given that `b1` was initially either 0, 1, or 2, after incrementing, `b1` will now be either 1 or 2 (if it was originally 0) or remain unchanged (if it was already 1 or 2). All other variables remain unaffected by this operation.
