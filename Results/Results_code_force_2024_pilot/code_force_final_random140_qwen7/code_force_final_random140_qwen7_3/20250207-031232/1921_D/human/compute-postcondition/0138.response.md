Postcondition: `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` represent the absolute differences as described. If `dif4` is greater than `dif1`, then `a2` is decremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by `dif4`, and the differences are recalculated accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `dif1`, and the differences are recalculated with `a1+1` and `b1+1`.
