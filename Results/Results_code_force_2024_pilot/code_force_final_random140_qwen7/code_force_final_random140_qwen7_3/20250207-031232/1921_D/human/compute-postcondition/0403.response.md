Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is `ans + dif3`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif3` adds the value of `dif3` to `ans`. Since `dif3` is defined as the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, the value of `ans` is updated by adding this specific value to its current state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
