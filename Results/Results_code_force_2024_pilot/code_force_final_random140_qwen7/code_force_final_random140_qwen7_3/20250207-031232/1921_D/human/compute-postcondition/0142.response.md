Output State: **`ans` is `dif3`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. This affects the calculation of `dif2` and `dif3`, which involve `a[a2]`. Since `a2` was previously `a2`, now it is `a2 - 1`. The other variables (`ans`, `dif1`, and `dif4`) remain unchanged.
