Postcondition: `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is at least `n - 3`, `b1` and `b2` are updated based on the value of `a1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated according to the conditions inside the if and else blocks, and `ans` is updated as follows:
- If `dif3 > dif4`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + dif3` and `b1` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, if `dif4 > dif1`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + dif4`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif1` and `b1` is increased by 1.
