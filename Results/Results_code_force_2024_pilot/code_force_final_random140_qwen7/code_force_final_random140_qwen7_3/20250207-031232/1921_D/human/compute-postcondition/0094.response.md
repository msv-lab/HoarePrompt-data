Output State: **`b1` is 1, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `ans` is `ans + dif1`, `a1` is increased by 1**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `b1` is either 0 or 1.
- `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. Since `b1` was either 0 or 1, after incrementing, `b1` will now be 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was 1). However, since `b1` can only be 0 or 1 based on the initial state, it must be 1 after the increment.
- All other variables (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `ans`, `a1`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
