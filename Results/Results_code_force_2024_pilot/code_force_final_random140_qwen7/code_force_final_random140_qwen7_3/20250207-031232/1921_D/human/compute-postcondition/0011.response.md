Output State: **`b1` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the same values for all variables except `ans`, which is explicitly set to 0.
