Output State: **`a1` is either 0 or 1; `a2` is `a2 - 1`; `b1` is `b1 + 2` if `a1` is 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif3`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `b1` is set to `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1. Since `a1` is either 0 or 1, if `a1` is 1, `b1` is incremented by 1. If `a1` is 0, `b1` remains unchanged from its previous value (`b1 + 1`).
- After the increment, `b1` is effectively `b1 + 2` if `a1` is 1 (since it was incremented once before and now again), and `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 0.
- No other variables are affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `b1` and keeps the other variables as they were initially described.
