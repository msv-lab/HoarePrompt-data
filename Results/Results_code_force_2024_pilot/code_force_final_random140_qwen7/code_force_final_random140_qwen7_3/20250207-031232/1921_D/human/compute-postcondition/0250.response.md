Postcondition: **`b1` is either 1 or 2, `dif1` remains the same, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is either increased by 1 or stays the same, `b2` is an index within the range of `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]` (or `a2-1` and `b[b1]`), `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, and either `b1` is increased by 1 or `ans` is increased by `dif1` depending on the condition `dif3 > dif1`.**
