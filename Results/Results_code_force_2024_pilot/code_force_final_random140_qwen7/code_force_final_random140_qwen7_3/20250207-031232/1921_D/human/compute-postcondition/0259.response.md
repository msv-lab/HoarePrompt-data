Output State: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]` plus `ans` by 1; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif3` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif3`. Since `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `ans` is updated by adding this value to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
