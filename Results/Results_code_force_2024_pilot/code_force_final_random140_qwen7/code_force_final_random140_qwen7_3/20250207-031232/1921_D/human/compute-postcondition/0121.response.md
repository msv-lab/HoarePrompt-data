Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.**

This means that `dif1` remains the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` remains the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, and now `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.
