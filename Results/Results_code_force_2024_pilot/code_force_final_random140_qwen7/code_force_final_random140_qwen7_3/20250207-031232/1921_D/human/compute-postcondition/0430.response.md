Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 3`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2] - 1`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-3]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-3]` and `b[b2] - 1`, `ans` is `ans + dif4`.**

Explanation: The value of `b2` is decremented by 1, so `b2` is now `n - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 3`. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
