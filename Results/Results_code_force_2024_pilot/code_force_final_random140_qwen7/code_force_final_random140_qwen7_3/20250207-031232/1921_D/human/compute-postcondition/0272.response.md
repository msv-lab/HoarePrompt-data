Postcondition: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. If `dif4 > dif2`, then `a2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, and `b1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`.**
