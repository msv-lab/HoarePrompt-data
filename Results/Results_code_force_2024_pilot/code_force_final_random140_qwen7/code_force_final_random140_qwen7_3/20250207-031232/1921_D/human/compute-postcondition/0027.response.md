Output State: **`b1` is 0; `t` is equal to `t - 1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`; `b2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is `ans + dif1`; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif1` adds the value of `dif1` to `ans`. Given that `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, the updated value of `ans` is `ans + abs(a[0] - b[0])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
