Output State: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif1` remains the same; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is increased by `dif1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif1` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
