Output State: **`a2` is `a2` - 1, `ans` is `ans` + `dif4`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The value of `a2` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The output state reflects this change and maintains the relationships defined by the initial state.
