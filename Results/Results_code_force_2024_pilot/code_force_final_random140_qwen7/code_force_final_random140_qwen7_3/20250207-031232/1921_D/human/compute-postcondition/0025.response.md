Output State: **`b1` is 1, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif3`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`.**

Explanation: The value of `b1` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b2`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged as no operations affecting these variables were performed.
