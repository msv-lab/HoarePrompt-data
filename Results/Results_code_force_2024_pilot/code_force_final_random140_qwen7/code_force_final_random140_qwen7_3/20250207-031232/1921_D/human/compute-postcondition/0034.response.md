Output State: **`ans` is now `dif4`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif4` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif4`. Since `dif4` is initially defined as `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, after executing the code, `ans` will be updated to `ans + abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
