Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1 + 1] - b[b2 - 1])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif2`.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `dif2` now becomes `abs(a[a1 + 1] - b[b2 - 1])` because `b2` has been updated. The other variables (`b1`, `dif1`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans`) retain their original values.
