Output State: **`b2` is `b2 - 1`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `dif4` to its current value; `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])`.**

Explanation: The line `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
