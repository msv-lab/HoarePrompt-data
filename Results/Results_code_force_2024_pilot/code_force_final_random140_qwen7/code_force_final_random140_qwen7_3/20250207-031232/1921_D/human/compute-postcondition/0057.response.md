Postcondition: `b1` is 0 or 1, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `b2` is either `m - 2` or `m - 1`, `ans` is either `dif3` or `ans + dif2`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, and the relationship between `dif3` and `dif4` remains as `dif3` is greater than `dif4` in the if part or `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4` in the else part.
