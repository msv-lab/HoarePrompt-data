Based on the initial state provided:

- `a1` is either 0 or 1.
- `a2` is 0.
- `b1` is `m - 1`.
- `b2` is `m - 1`.
- `ans` is the sum of all differences that were added during the loop's execution.

Since the exact loop and how `ans` was computed are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is the sum of all differences added during the loop's execution.

Given this information, the print statement will output the value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of all differences added during the loop's execution)**
