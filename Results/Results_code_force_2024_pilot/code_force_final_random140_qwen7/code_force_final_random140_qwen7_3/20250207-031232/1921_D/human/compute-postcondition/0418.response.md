Postcondition: **`a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is either `n - 3`, `n - 2`, or `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is increased by either `dif4` or `dif1`, and `b1` is incremented by 1 if `a1` is 1.**
