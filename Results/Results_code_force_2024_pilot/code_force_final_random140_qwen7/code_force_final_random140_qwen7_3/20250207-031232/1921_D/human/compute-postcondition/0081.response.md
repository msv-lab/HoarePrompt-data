Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif3`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif3`. Since `dif3` is defined as `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `ans` now holds the value of its previous value plus `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
