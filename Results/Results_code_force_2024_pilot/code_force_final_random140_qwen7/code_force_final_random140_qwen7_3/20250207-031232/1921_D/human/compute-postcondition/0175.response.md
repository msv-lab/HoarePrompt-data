Output State: **`b1` is 0; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`; `b2` is `m - 1`; `b` is a list of integers; `ans` is 0.**

In this state, the variable `dif1` is calculated as the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`. All other variables retain their initial or unchanged values.
