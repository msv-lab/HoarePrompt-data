Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by `dif2`. The other variables (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
