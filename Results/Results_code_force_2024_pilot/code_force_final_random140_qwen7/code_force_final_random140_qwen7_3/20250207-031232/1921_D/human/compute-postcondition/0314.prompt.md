Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b1` is 0, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` and `a2` are indices within the range of `a`, `b2` is an index within the range of `b`, `ans` is either `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, or `dif4` depending on the condition, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`, and `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[b2]`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is updated based on the following rules: if `dif1 > dif2`, then `ans` is increased by either `dif1` or `dif4` based on the condition `dif3 > dif1` or `dif3 > dif4` respectively; otherwise, `ans` is updated as follows: if `dif3 > dif4`, then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `b1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `b2` is decreased by 1. If `dif4 > dif2`, then `a2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, and `b1` remains unchanged; otherwise, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is updated based on the following rules: if `dif1 > dif2`, then if `dif3 > dif4`, `ans` is increased by `dif3` by 1; otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `dif4` to its current value. If `dif4 > dif2`, then `b2` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `b1` is either 1 or 2. If `dif1 <= dif2`, then if `dif3 > dif2`, `ans` is updated by adding `dif3` to its current value; otherwise, if `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is updated by adding `dif4` to its current value, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` is incremented by 1 while still being less than or equal to `a2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
