Output State: **`a1` is 1, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2 - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is `ans` plus `dif2`.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. Since `b2` was originally either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, after decrementing, `b2` becomes either `n - 3` or `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
