Output State: **`b1` is either 1 or 2; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `dif3` to its current value.**

Explanation: The value of `b1` is incremented by 1. Since `b1` was initially either 0, 1, or 2, after incrementing, `b1` will now be either 1 or 2 (if it was 0) or 2 or 3 (if it was 1), but since the maximum value `b1` can take is 2 based on the initial state, it will be 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
