To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head, which is `t > 0`. The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Given the current state:
- `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2.
- `t` is a positive integer less than its original value.
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`.
- `b2` is an index within the range of `b`.
- `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.
- `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`.
- `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.
- `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.
- `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration of the loop, with the loop terminating when `a1` exceeds `a2`.

The only state that affects whether the loop continues is `t`. Since `t` is a positive integer and it is less than its original value, it means `t` has been decremented at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration of the loop, with the loop terminating when `a1` exceeds `a2`.**
