Output State: **`b1` is 1, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `ans` is `ans + dif1`, `a1` is `a1 + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `b1` is incremented by 1. Since `b1` was either 0 or 1, incrementing it by 1 means `b1` is now 1. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `ans`, and `a1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
