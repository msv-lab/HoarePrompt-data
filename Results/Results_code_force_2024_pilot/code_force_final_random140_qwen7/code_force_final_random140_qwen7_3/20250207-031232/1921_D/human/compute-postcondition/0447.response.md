Output State: **`a1` is either 0 or 1; `a2` is `a2 - 1`; `b1` is `b1 + 2` if `a1` is 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif3` and `b1` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1. So, if `a1` is 1, `b1` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (`b1 + 1`).
- Now, the code increments `b1` by 1 again, so `b1` is effectively increased by 2 if `a1` is 1 (previous increment + current increment).
- The other variables remain unchanged based on the provided code snippet.
