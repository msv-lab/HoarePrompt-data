Postcondition: **`b2` is `m - 2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` if `dif4 > dif2` is true, otherwise `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`. `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 2`, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is either `dif2` or `dif1` depending on the condition, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[m-1]`, and `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`.**
