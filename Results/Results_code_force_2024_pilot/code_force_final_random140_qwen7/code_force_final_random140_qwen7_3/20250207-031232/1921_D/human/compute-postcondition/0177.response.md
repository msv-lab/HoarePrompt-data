Output State: **`b1` is 0; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`; `b2` is `m - 1`; `b` is a list of integers; `ans` is 0; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `dif3` as the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. Given that `a2` is `n - 1` and `b1` is `0`, `dif3` becomes the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
