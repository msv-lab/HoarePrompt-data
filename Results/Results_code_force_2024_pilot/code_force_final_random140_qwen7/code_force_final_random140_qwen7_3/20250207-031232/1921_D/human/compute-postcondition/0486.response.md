Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. For each test case, it sorts the lists a and b, then iterates through them to find the minimum possible sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of a and b. After processing all test cases, it prints the minimum sum of absolute differences for each test case.**
