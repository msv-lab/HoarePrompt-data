Output State: **`a1` is 1, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is `ans + dif1`, `b1` is `b1 + 1`**.

The value of `b1` is incremented by 1, while the values of `a1`, `a2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
