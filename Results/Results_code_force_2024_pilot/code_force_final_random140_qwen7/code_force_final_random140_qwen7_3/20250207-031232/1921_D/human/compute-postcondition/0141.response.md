Output State: **`ans` is `dif3`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif3` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif3`. Since `ans` was initially 0 (as no other value is given), it now equals `dif3`. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged from their initial state.
