Output State: **`b1` is 0; `t` is equal to `t - 1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`; `b2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `dif3` as the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` (which is `a[a2]` and `a2` is `n - 1`) and the first element of list `b` (which is `b[b1]` and `b1` is 0). The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
