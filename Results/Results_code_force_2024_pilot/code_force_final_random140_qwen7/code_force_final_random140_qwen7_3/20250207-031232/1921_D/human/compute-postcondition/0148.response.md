Postcondition: **`ans` is the minimum of `dif3` and `dif2` + `dif2`. `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b2-1]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1+1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation:
- If `dif3 > dif2`, then `ans` is set to `dif3`, and the values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly.
- If `dif3 <= dif2`, then `ans` is set to `ans + dif2`, and the values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly.
