Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `a[a1]` (which is `a[0]` since `a1` is 0) and `b[b2]` to `dif2`. Since `a1` is 0, `a[a1]` remains `a[0]`. The value of `dif2` is calculated but no specific values are given for `b[b2]`, so `dif2` is expressed as the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`. The other variables (`a1`, `a2`, and `dif1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
