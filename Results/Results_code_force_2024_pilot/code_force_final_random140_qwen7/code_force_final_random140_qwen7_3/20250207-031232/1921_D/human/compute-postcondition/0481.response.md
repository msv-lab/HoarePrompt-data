Output State: **a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is 0, b1 is m - 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the sum of all differences that were added during the loop's execution, and all other variables retain their final values from the last iteration.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `a1` will either be 0 or 1 because the loop continues as long as `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. Since `a2` is reduced by 1 each time it reaches `n - 1`, eventually it will become 0. `b1` and `b2` will both be `m - 1` because they are only incremented within the loop and never decremented once they reach `m - 1`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of the maximum differences calculated during each iteration of the loop. All other variables, such as `n`, `m`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
