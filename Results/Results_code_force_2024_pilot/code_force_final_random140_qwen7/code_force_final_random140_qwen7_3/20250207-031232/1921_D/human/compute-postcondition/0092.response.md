Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif1`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif1`. Since `dif1` is defined as `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `ans` will now be the original value of `ans` plus `abs(a[0] - b[0])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
