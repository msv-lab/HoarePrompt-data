Postcondition: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` and `a2` are indices within the range of `a`, `b2` is an index within the range of `b`, `ans` is either `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, or `dif4` depending on the condition, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`, and `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[b2]`**.

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. It covers all the conditions specified in both the if and else parts, ensuring that the relationships between the variables are accurately represented.
