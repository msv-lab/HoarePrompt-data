Postcondition: `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is either `n - 2`, `n - 1`, or `n - 3`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2 - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is increased by either `dif3` or `dif2` if `dif3 > dif4`, otherwise `ans` is increased by the maximum of `dif4` (when `a2` is `n - 3`) and `dif2` (when `a2` is `n - 1`), `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 0.
