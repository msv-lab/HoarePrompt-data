Postcondition: `a1` is either 0 or 1; `a2` is `a2 - 1`; `b1` is adjusted by either `b1 + 1` or `b1 + 2` based on the value of `a1`; `b2` is decreased by 1 in both cases; `dif1` and `dif2` are recalculated based on the new positions of `b1` and `b2`; `dif3` and `dif4` are updated to reflect the new absolute differences between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, and `a[a2]` and `b[b2]` respectively; `ans` is updated as follows: if `dif3 > dif2`, then `ans` is `ans + dif3`; otherwise, `ans` is `ans + dif2` (with `b2` decreased by 1 if `dif3 > dif2`); if `dif4 > dif2`, then `ans` is `ans + dif4`; otherwise, `ans` is `ans + dif2` (with `b2` decreased by 1 if `dif4 > dif2`).
