Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a1 = 0
    a2 = n - 1
    b1 = 0
    b2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    b.sort()
    a.sort()
    while a1 <= a2:
        dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
        dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
        dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
        dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
        if dif1 > dif2:
            if dif3 > dif4:
                if dif3 > dif1:
                    ans += dif3
                    a2 -= 1
                    b1 += 1
                else:
                    ans += dif1
                    a1 += 1
                    b1 += 1
            elif dif4 > dif1:
                ans += dif4
                a2 -= 1
                b2 -= 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif2:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif2
                a1 += 1
                b2 -= 1
        elif dif4 > dif2:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `b1` is either 0 or 1, `t` is equal to `t - i` where `i` is the total number of iterations, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `b2` is 0, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences found during each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `a1` will always be 0 because the loop continues as long as `a1 <= a2`, and `a2` is only decremented when certain conditions are met. Similarly, `a2` will be 0 because it is only decremented and never incremented. The value of `b1` will either remain 0 or increment to 1 depending on the conditions inside the loop. The variable `t` will be reduced by the total number of iterations, which is `i`. The list `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `b2` will also be 0 because it is only decremented and never incremented. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of the maximum absolute differences found during each iteration of the loop, ensuring that the final value of `ans` reflects the optimal solution based on the conditions specified in the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration of the loop, with the loop terminating when `a1` exceeds `a2`.

This final state indicates that after all iterations of the loop, `b1` will still be either 0, 1, or 2, reflecting the index in list `b` that was most frequently compared with elements in list `a`. The variable `t` will be a positive integer less than its original value due to the decrement operations within the loop. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `a1` and `a2` will be adjusted such that `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. The variable `b2` will also remain within the bounds of list `b`. The `ans` variable will hold the cumulative sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration, ensuring that it reflects the optimal matching between elements of `a` and `b` according to the conditions specified in the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is 0, b1 is m - 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the sum of all differences that were added during the loop's execution, and all other variables retain their final values from the last iteration.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
