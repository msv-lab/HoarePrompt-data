Output State: **`ans` is now `dif4`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, `a2` is `a2 - 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `a2` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) retain their original values as no operation was performed on them.
