Postcondition: `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is at least `n - 3`, `b1` and `b2` are updated according to the value of `a1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are recalculated based on the updated values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`, `ans` is updated as follows: if `dif3 > dif1`, then `ans` is `ans + dif3` and `b1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is `ans + dif1` and `b1` is increased by 1.
