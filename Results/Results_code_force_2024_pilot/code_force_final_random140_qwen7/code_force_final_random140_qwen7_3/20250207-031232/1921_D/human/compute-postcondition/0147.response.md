Postcondition: `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4` represent the absolute differences as described. If `dif3 > dif2`, then `ans` is set to `dif3`, and the values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif2`, and the values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4` are also updated accordingly.
