Output State: **`a1` is 1, `a2` must be at least `n - 3`, `b1` is increased by 1, `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `ans` is `ans + dif1`.**

Explanation: The variable `b1` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values. The condition for `b1` being `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1 remains the same, and `ans` is updated by adding `dif1` to its current value.
