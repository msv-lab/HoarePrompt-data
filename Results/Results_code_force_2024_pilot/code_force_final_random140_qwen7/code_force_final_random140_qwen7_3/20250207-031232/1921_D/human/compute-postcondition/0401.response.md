Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `dif3` as the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. Since `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `a[a2]` becomes either `a[n-2]` or `a[n-1]`. However, since `a1` is 0, `a[0]` remains unchanged. The values of `dif1` and `dif2` are not affected by this line of code, so they remain as the absolute differences between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, and `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, respectively.
