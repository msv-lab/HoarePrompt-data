Output State: **`b1` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `b1`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, and `a2` are preserved.
