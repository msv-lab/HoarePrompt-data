Output State: `b1` is either 0 or 1, `t` is equal to `t - i` where `i` is the total number of iterations, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `b2` is 0, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences found during each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `a1` will always be 0 because the loop continues as long as `a1 <= a2`, and `a2` is only decremented when certain conditions are met. Similarly, `a2` will be 0 because it is only decremented and never incremented. The value of `b1` will either remain 0 or increment to 1 depending on the conditions inside the loop. The variable `t` will be reduced by the total number of iterations, which is `i`. The list `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `b2` will also be 0 because it is only decremented and never incremented. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of the maximum absolute differences found during each iteration of the loop, ensuring that the final value of `ans` reflects the optimal solution based on the conditions specified in the loop.
