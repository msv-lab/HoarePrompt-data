Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is `ans + dif1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif1` increments the value of `ans` by `dif1`. Since `dif1` is already defined as the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, the only change is that `ans` now holds the value of its previous value plus `dif1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
