Output State: **`b1` is 0, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b` (i.e., `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`), where `a1` is 0 and `b1` is 0. This difference is stored in the variable `dif1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
