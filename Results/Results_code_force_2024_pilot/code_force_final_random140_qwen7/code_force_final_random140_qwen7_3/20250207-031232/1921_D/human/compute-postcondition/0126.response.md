Output State: **`ans` is `dif1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif1` adds the value of `dif1` to `ans`. Since `dif1` is defined as the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, the value of `ans` now includes this addition. The other variables (`dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
