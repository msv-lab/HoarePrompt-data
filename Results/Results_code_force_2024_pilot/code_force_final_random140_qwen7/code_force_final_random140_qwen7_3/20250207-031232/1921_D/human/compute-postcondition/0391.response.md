Output State: **`b2` is `m - 2`, `a1` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is `n - 1` less than its initial value, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `dif2`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 2])`, and `dif4` is less than or equal to `dif2`.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. Initially, `b2` was `m - 1`. After the decrement, `b2` becomes `m - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
