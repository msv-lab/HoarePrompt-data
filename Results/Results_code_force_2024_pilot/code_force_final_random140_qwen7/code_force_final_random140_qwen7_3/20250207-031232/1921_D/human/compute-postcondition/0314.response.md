Output State: `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences found during each iteration of the loop, where the loop iterates until `a1` exceeds `a2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `b1` will still be either 0, 1, or 2, indicating which element from list `b` was compared with elements from list `a`. The variable `t` will be a positive integer less than its original value due to the decrement operations inside the loop. The variables `n` and `m` will remain unchanged as they were input parameters. List `a` will stay sorted in ascending order. The variable `a1` will be less than or equal to `a2`, indicating the current range of comparison in list `a`. `b2` will be an index within the range of list `b`, showing the last element of `b` that was compared. Finally, `ans` will hold the total sum of the maximum absolute differences found during each iteration of the loop.
