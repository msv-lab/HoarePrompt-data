Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `b`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new variable `b` is created and populated with integers from the input.
