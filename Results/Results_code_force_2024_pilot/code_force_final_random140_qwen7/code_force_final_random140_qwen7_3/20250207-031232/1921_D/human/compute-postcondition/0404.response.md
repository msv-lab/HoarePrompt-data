Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is `ans + dif3`.**

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. Initially, `a2` was either `n - 2` or `n - 1`. After decrementing, `a2` becomes `n - 2` (since decrementing `n - 1` results in `n - 2`). The other variables (`a1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
