Postcondition: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is updated based on the following rules: if `dif3 > dif2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `b1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `b2` is decreased by 1.**
