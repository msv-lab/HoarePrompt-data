Output State: **`b1` is 0, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is 0, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `dif2` as the absolute difference between `a[a1]` (which is `a[0]`) and `b[b2]` (which is `b[m-1]`). Since `a1` is 0 and `b2` is `m - 1`, `dif2` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
