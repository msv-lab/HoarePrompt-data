The loop head is `while a1 <= a2:`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `a1` and `a2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a1` and `a2` are such that `a1 <= a2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` after the adjustments.

Since no specific conditions are given about the values of `a1` and `a2` changing during the loop body, we cannot assume any specific changes. However, we know that for the loop to continue, `a1` should not exceed `a2`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`.

State: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2`, `b2` is an index within the range of `b`, `ans` is either `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, or `dif4` depending on the condition, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`, and `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[b2]`**
