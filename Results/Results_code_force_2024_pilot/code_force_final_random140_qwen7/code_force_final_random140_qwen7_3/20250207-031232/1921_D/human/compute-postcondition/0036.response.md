Output State: **`ans` is `dif4`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, `b2` is `b2 - 1`, `a2` is `a2 - 1`**.

In natural language: The value of `b2` is decremented by 1, and the value of `a2` is also decremented by 1. All other variables (`ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) retain their original values.
