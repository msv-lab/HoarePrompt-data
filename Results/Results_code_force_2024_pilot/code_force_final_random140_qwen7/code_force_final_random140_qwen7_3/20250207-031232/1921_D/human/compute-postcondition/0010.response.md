Output State: **`b1` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`.**

The code `b2 = m - 1` assigns the value of `m - 1` to `b2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `b2` is `m - 1`, while all other variables retain their initial states.
