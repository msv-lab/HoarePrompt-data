Postcondition: **`a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is at least `n - 3`, `b1` and `b2` are updated based on the value of `a1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated according to the conditions inside the if and else blocks, and `ans` is updated as follows:
- If `dif3 > dif1` and `a1` is 1, then `ans` is updated to `ans + dif3` and `b1` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif1` and `b1` is increased by 1.
- If `a2` is greater than or equal to `n - 3`, `a2` is decreased by 1 and `b1` is increased by 1 if `a1` is 1.
- `dif3` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])` and `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.

- If `dif3 > dif2`, then `ans` is `ans + dif3`; otherwise, `ans` is `ans + dif2` (with `b2` decreased by 1 if `dif3 > dif2`).
- If `dif4 > dif2`, then `ans` is `ans + dif4`; otherwise, `ans` is `ans + dif2` (with `b2` decreased by 1 if `dif4 > dif2`).**
