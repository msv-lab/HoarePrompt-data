Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code `a1 += 1` increments the value of `a1` by 1. This affects the calculation of `dif1` and `dif2` since they depend on `a[a1]` and now `a1` has been incremented. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged, and thus the values of `dif3` and `dif4` remain the same. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as well, but its relationship to `dif2` is preserved.
