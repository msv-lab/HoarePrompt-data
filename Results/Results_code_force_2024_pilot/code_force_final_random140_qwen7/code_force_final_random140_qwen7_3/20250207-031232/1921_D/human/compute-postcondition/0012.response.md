Output State: **`b1` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. Since `b` was previously a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, after sorting, `b` will contain the same integers but in sorted order. All other variables remain unchanged.
