`t` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `t` must be greater than 0, so after decrementing, `t` will be a positive integer less than its original value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `b2` is 0, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences found during each iteration of the loop.**
