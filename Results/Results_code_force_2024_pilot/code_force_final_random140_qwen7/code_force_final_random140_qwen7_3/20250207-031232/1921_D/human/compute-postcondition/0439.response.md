Postcondition: `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is either `n - 3`, `n - 2`, or `n - 1`, `b1` is incremented by 1 if `a1` is 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2 - 1]` or `b[b2]` depending on the value of `a2`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `dif3` (when `a2` is `n - 2`) and `dif2` (when `a2` is `n - 1` or `n - 3`), and `b1` is incremented by 1 if `a1` is 1.
