Output State: **`ans` is `dif2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif2`. Since `ans` was initially 0 (implied by the context), it now equals `dif2`. The other variables (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`) remain unchanged.
