Output State: **`a2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2`, `b2` is an index within the range of `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decreases the value of `a2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
