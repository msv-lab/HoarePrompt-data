Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif4`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b1` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is updated by adding `dif4` to its previous value. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions, including the fact that `dif3` is not greater than `dif4` and `dif4` is greater than `dif2`.
