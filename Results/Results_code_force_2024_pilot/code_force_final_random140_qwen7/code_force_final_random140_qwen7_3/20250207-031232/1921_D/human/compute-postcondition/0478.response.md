Postcondition: `a1` is either 0 or 1; `a2` is `a2 - 1`; `b1` is adjusted based on the value of `a1` (either `b1 + 1` or `b1 + 2`); `b2` is decreased by 1 in both cases; `dif1` and `dif2` are recalculated based on the new values of `b1` and `b2`; `dif3` and `dif4` are updated accordingly; `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if `dif3 > dif2`, then `ans` is incremented by `dif3`; otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif2` if `dif3 <= dif2` and `dif4 > dif2`, otherwise `ans` is incremented by `dif4`.
