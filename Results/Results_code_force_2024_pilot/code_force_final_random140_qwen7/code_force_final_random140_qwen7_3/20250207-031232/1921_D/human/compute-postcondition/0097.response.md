Postcondition: `b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is updated as follows: if `dif3 > dif4`, then `ans` is `ans + dif3` and `a1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` is `ans + dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1 if `dif4 > dif1`, and `a1` is incremented by 1 if `dif4 <= dif1`.
