Postcondition: `a1` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `a` is `n - 1` less than its initial value, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b2` is either `m - 2` or `m - 1`, `ans` is either `dif3` or `dif2`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b2])`, and `b1` is increased by 1 if `dif3 > dif2`, otherwise `b1` remains unchanged.
