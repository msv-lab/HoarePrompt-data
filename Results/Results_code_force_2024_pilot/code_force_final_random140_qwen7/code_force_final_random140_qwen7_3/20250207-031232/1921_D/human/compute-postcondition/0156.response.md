Postcondition: `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, then `ans` is increased by `dif4`, and the variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a2`, and `b2` are updated accordingly (i.e., `a2` is decreased by 1 and `b2` is decreased by 1). Otherwise, `ans` is set to `dif2`, and the variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a2`, and `b2` are updated as specified in the else part.
