Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `b2` is 0, `b` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `b`. The values of `b1`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `a1`, `a2`, and `b2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
