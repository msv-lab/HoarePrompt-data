Output State: **`a2` is `a2` - 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is `ans` plus `dif3`.**

Explanation: The value of `a2` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
