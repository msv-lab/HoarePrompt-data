Output State: **`ans` is `dif1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[b1+1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. This change affects the calculation of `dif1`, which was originally the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[b1]`. After the increment, `b1` becomes `b1 + 1`, so `dif1` is now the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[b1+1]`. The values of `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the increment operation.
