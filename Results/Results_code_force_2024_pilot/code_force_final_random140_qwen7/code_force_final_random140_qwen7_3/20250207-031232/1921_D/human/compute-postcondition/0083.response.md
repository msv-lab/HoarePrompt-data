Output State: **`b1` is 1, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])`, `ans` is `ans + dif3`**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `b1` is either 0 or 1. The line `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. Since `b1` was either 0 or 1, after incrementing, its value becomes 1. All other variables (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
