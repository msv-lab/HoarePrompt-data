Output State: **`a1` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is `n - 1` less than its initial value, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b1])`**

Explanation: The code calculates `dif3` as the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b1]`. Since `a2` is defined as `n - 1`, the updated value of `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, which is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
