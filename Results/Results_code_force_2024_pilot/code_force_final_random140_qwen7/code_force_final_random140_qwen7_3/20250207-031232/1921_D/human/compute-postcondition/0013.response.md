Output State: **`b1` is 0, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. `t` is mentioned as being equal to `t - 1`, which implies that `t` was originally set to some value and then decremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions or states.
