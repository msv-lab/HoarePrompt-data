Output State: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is one more than `a1` (which was less than or equal to `a2`); `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `dif1` to its current value.**

In this output state, `a1` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
