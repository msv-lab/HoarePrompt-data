Postcondition: **`b1` is 1 if `dif3 > dif2`, otherwise `b1` is 0. `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`. `t` is a positive integer less than its original value. `n` and `m` are input integers. `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. `a1` and `a2` are indices within the range of `a`. `b2` is an index within the range of `b`. `ans` is either `dif2` or `dif3` depending on the condition. `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`. `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`. `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[b2]`.**

This postcondition summarizes the possible outcomes after executing the if-else block. Depending on whether `dif3 > dif2` is true or false, `b1` will be set to 1 or 0 respectively. The value of `dif1` will be updated based on the current value of `b2`. The variable `t` remains a positive integer less than its original value. The indices `a1` and `a2` remain within the range of `a`, while `b2` changes to `m-2` if the else part is executed. The value of `ans` will be either `dif2` or `dif3` depending on the condition, and `dif2` and `dif3` retain their respective definitions.
