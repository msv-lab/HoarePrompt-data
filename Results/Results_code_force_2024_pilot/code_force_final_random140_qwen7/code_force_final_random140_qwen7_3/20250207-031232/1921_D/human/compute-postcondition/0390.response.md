Output State: **`a1` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is `n - 1` less than its initial value, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif2`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, and `dif4` is less than or equal to `dif2`.**

Explanation: The variable `a1` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions or expressions as specified in the initial state.
