Output State: **`a1` is 1, `a2` must be at least `n - 3`, `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `ans` is `ans + dif2`.**

Explanation: 
- `a1` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1.
- The other variables (`a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `ans`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions. Therefore, `a2` must still be at least `n - 3`, `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` was 1 (which it is now), `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, and `ans` is `ans + dif2`.
