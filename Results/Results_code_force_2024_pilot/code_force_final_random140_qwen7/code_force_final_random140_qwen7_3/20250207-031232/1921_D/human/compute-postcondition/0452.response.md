Postcondition: `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is at least `n - 3`, `b1` is updated based on the value of `a1`, `dif1` and `dif2` represent the absolute differences as defined, `dif3` and `dif4` are updated according to the conditions inside the if and else blocks, and `ans` is updated as follows: 
- If `dif3 > dif1`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + dif3` and `b1` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif1` and `b1` is increased by 1.
