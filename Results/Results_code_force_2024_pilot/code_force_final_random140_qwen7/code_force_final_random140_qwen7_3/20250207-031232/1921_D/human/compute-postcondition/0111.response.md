Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1 + 1] - b[b2 - 1])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2 - 1])`; `ans` is `ans + dif2`.**

Explanation: The value of `b2` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `dif2` and `dif4` now refer to `b[b2 - 1]` instead of `b[b2]`.
