Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `b2` is 0, `b` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `a1`. Since `a1` was already `0` in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.
