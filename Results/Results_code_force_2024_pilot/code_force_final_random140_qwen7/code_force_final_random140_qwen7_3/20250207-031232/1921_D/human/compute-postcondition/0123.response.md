Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is `ans` plus `dif3`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by `dif3`. Since `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `ans` now includes this value added to its previous state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
