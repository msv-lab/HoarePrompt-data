Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b2-1]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `dif2` and `dif4` now involve `b[b2-1]` instead of `b[b2]`.
