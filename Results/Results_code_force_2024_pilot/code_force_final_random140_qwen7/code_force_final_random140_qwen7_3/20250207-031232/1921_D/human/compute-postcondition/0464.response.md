Output State: **`a1` is either 0 or 1; `a2` is `a2 - 1`; `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif3`.**

Explanation: 
- `a2` is decremented by 1.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged as no other operations or assignments are performed on the other variables.
