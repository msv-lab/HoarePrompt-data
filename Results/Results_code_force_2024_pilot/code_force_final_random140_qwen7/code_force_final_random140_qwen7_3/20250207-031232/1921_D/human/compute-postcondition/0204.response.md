Output State: **`b1` is 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is `dif1`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[m-1]`, and `dif4` is not greater than `dif1`.**

Explanation: The value of `a1` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously mentioned states.
