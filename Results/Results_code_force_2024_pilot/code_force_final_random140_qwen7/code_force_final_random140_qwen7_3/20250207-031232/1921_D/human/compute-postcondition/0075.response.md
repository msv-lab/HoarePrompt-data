Postcondition: **`b1` is either 0 or 1, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `b2` is either `m - 2` or `m - 1`, `ans` is updated as follows: if `dif1 > dif2`, then `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif3` if `dif3 > dif1` and `ans + dif1` otherwise; otherwise, `ans` is updated based on the following rules: if `dif3 > dif4`, then `ans` is set to `dif3`; otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif4` if `dif4 > dif2`, or `ans` remains unchanged if `dif4 <= dif2`. `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, and `a` and `b` remain lists of integers sorted in ascending order.**
