Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`. This part is correct.

2. **Sorting**: Both arrays `a` and `b` are sorted. Sorting is necessary to efficiently find the best match for each element in `a` from `b`.

3. **Pairing Strategy**: The program uses a strategy to pair elements from `a` and `b` to maximize the total difference. It iterates through the sorted arrays and calculates the differences between pairs of elements from `a` and `b`. The logic inside the loop ensures that the maximum possible difference is chosen at each step.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the smallest and largest elements in `a` are paired with the smallest and largest elements in `b`, respectively, to maximize the difference. This is a valid approach to maximize the total difference.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum total difference `D`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and should achieve the goal of maximizing the total difference `D`.

Correctness: **True**
