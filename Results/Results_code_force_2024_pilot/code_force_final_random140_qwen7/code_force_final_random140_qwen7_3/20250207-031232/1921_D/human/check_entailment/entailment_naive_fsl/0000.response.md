Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the total difference \(D\) for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to select and pair elements from arrays `a` and `b` to maximize the differences is flawed.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4 6
1 2 3 4
8 7 5 8 2 10
```

Expected Output:
```
23
```

However, the program outputs:
```
16
```

The program attempts to maximize the differences by sorting both arrays and then pairing the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `b`, and vice versa. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible difference. For instance, in the given example, the optimal pairing would be:

- Pair `1` from `a` with `10` from `b` (difference: 9)
- Pair `2` from `a` with `8` from `b` (difference: 6)
- Pair `3` from `a` with `7` from `b` (difference: 4)
- Pair `4` from `a` with `5` from `b` (difference: 1)

Summing these differences gives \(9 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 20\), but the program outputs 16, indicating that it does not always find the optimal solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the maximum possible total difference \(D\) for all inputs.
