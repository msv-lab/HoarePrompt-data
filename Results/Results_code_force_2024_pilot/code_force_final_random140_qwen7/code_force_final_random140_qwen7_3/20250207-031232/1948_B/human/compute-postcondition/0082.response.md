Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[4]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[4]` divided by 10, `n` is either 2 or 3, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` and now also contains the last digit of `a[4]`, `i` is 4, `y` is now equal to `int(a[4] / 10)`**

Explanation: The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `c`. Given that `i` is 4, it appends the last digit of `a[4]` to `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.
