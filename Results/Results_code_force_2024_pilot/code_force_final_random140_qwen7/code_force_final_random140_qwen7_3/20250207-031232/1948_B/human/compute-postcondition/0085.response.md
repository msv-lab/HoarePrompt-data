Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[4]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[4]` divided by 10, `n` is either 3 or 4, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` and now also contains the last digit of `a[4]`, `i` is 4, `y` is now equal to `int(a[4] / 10)`**.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `y >= c[n - 1]` is true or false, the final state of the variables `t`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `c`, and `i` will be as described. Specifically, `c` will always contain the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` and now also includes the last digit of `a[4]`.
