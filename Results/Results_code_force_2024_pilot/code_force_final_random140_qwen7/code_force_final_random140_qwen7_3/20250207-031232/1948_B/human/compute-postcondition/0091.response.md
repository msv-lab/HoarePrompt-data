Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[4]`, `y` is the last digit of `a[4]`, `n` is either 2 or 3, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` and the last digit of `a[4]`, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[4]` (since `i` is 4) to the list `c`. Initially, `c` contains the last digit of either `a[2]` or `a[3]`. After appending, `c` now contains the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` and the last digit of `a[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
