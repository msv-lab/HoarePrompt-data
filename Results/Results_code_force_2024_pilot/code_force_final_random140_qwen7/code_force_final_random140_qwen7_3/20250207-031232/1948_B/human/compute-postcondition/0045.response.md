Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 1, `c` is a list containing the element `a[i]`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `n` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial states as per the precondition.
