Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[2]` if `a[2] > 10` and `1 > 0`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[1]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[2]` divided by 10, `n` is either 2 or 3, `c` is a list containing the appropriate elements as per the condition, `i` is 3, `x` is the last digit of `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] > 10` and `1 > 0`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[i-2]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, which is the integer part of `a[i-1]` divided by 10.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, taking into account the condition `y <= x` and its negation. It ensures that the variables `t`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `c`, and `i` are correctly updated according to the specified rules in each case.
