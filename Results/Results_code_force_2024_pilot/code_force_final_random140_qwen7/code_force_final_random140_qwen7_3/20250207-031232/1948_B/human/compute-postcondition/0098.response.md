Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[4]` if `a[4] > 10` and `i > 0`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` depending on the condition, `y` is the integer part of `a[2]` or `a[3]` divided by 10, `n` is 3 or 4, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]`, `i` is 4 or 5, and `c` is appended with `a[5]` if `i` is 5, `y` is the integer part of `a[4]` divided by 10 if `a[4] > 10` and `i > 0`, otherwise `y` is the integer part of `a[2]` or `a[3]` divided by 10.
