Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `n` is 0, `c` is a list containing the value of `y` appended with `x`, `i` is 0, the current value of `a[i]` is greater than 10, and the current value of `y` is less than or equal to the last element of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(x)` appends the last digit of `a[i]` (which is stored in `x`) to the list `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
