Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` where `i` is 3 if `a[i] > 10` and `1 > 0`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[i-1]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `n` is 3, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[i]` or the value of `y` appended with `x` if `a[i] > 10` and `1 > 0`, otherwise `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[i-1]` or the value of `y` appended with `x` if `a[i-1] > 10` and `1 > 0`, otherwise `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[0]` or the first element of `a`, `i` is 3, `x` is the last digit of `a[3]` if `a[3] > 10` and `1 > 0`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[2]`, `y` is now the integer part of `a[3]` divided by 10, which is the integer part of `a[2]` divided by 10, `c` is updated by appending the last element of `a` (which is `a[2]` since `i` is now 3).**
