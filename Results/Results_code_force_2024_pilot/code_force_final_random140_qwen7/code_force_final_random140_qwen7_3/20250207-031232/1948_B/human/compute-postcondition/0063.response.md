Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[1]` if `a[1] > 10` and `1 > 0`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[1]` divided by 10 if `a[1] > 10` and `1 > 0`, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is either 1 or 2, `c` is a list containing either the last digit of `a[1]` or the value of `y` appended with `x` if `a[1] > 10` and `1 > 0`, otherwise `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[0]` or the first element of `a`, `i` is 2, `x` is the last digit of `a[2]` if `a[2] > 10` and `1 > 0`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[1]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[2]` divided by 10, `c` is now a list containing the last element of `c` (which was either the last digit of `a[1]` or the value of `y` appended with `x` if `a[1] > 10` and `1 > 0`, otherwise the last digit of `a[0]` or the first element of `a`) and `y`.**

In this output state, the list `c` has had its last element appended with the value of `y`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
