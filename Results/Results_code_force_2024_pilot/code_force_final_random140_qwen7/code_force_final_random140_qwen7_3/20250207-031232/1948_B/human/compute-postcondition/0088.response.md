Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[4]`, `y` is the last digit of `a[4]`, `n` is either 2 or 3, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` and `y`, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code `c.append(y)` appends the value of `y` (which is the last digit of `a[4]`) to the list `c`. The values of `t`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `c` now contains the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` along with `y`.
