Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[4]`, `y` is the last digit of `a[4]`, `n` is either 2 or 3, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` and `x`, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. Since `x` is the last digit of `a[4]`, and `c` originally contains the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` and `y`, after appending `x`, `c` now contains the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
