#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.

    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of `a[len(a) - 1]` if `a[len(a) - 1] > 10` and `len(a) - 1 > 0`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[len(a) - 1]` divided by 10, `n` is the total number of elements in `a` multiplied by 2 minus 1 (since every valid `a[i] > 10` appends 2 elements to `c` and others append 1), `c` is a list containing all the processed elements according to the conditions, `i` is equal to `len(a)` (since the loop iterates over the length of `a` and increments `i` until it reaches the end).
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: `b` is a list containing either 0 or 1, depending on whether `c` is equal to `d`. `d` is a sorted version of `c`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of `a[len(a) - 1]` if `a[len(a) - 1] > 10` and `len(a) - 1 > 0`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[len(a) - 1]` divided by 10, `n` is the total number of elements in `a` multiplied by 2 minus 1, `c` is a list containing all the processed elements according to the conditions, and `i` is equal to `len(a)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it constructs a new list `c` based on specific conditions involving the digits of the numbers in `a`. It then sorts `c` and checks if `c` is equal to its sorted version. If `c` is equal to its sorted version, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`. The function ultimately returns the list `b`, which contains either `0` or `1` for each test case.
