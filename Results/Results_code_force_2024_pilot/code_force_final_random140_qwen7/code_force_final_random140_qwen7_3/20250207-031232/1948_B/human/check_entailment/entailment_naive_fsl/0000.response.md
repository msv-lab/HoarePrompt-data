Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the array elements are split and the resulting array needs to be checked for non-decreasing order.

Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
```

The expected output is "YES" because after splitting the elements, the array can be transformed into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted.

However, the program fails to correctly process the array elements and check if the resulting array is sorted. Instead, it seems to be trying to split elements greater than 10 but does not properly reconstruct the array to check for sorted order.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Split elements greater than 10 into their individual digits.
2. Reconstruct the array with these digits.
3. Check if the reconstructed array is sorted.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement these steps, it returns incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
