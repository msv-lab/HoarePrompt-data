Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b`.
2. It then iterates over the test cases but calls `func_1()` without passing any arguments, which is incorrect because `func_1()` requires input.
3. Inside `func_1()`, the program correctly processes each test case:
   - It reads the size of the array `k` and the array itself.
   - It splits the numbers into their individual digits and checks if they can form a non-decreasing sequence.
   - It appends `1` to `b` if the resulting list `c` is sorted, otherwise, it appends `0`.
4. After processing all test cases, the program prints `YES` or `NO` based on the values in `b`.

However, the main issue lies in the fact that the program does not actually call `func_1()` with the correct parameters. Instead, it calls `func_1()` in a loop without passing any arguments, which means the actual logic inside `func_1()` is never executed for the test cases.

Given this, the program will not produce the expected output for any test cases because `b` will always remain empty or contain incorrect values due to the unexecuted function calls.

Correctness: **False**
