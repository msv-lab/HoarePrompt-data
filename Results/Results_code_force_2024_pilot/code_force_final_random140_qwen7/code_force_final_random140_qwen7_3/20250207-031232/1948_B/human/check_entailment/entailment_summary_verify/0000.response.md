### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to sort an array \(a\) by repeatedly splitting elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and inserting them back into the array in the same positions.
- The goal is to check if the array can be made non-decreasing after performing the operations any number of times.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes each test case and constructs a new list `c` based on specific conditions involving the digits of the numbers in `a`.
- It then sorts `c` and checks if `c` is equal to its sorted version.
- If `c` is equal to its sorted version, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` without passing any parameters, which is incorrect because `func_1()` expects two inputs: `k` and a string representation of the list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the size `k` of the array and the array `a` as a space-separated string.
   - It converts the string into a list of integers.
   - It then iterates through the array and splits elements greater than 10 into their individual digits.
   - The function constructs a new list `c` based on the conditions provided in the function summary.
   - Finally, it checks if `c` is sorted and appends `1` or `0` to the list `b`.

3. **Reconstruction and Sorting:**
   - The function correctly handles the splitting of elements greater than 10.
   - However, the reconstruction and sorting logic are flawed. The function does not ensure that the array `c` is sorted before checking if it matches the sorted version of itself.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The main program prints 'YES' if `b[i] == 1` and 'NO' if `b[i] == 0` for each test case.
   - This part is correct, but the issue lies in the function `func_1` which does not correctly reconstruct and sort the array.

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. This is accurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly reconstruct the array after splitting the elements.
- The function summary indicates that the function should construct a new list `c` and check if it is sorted, but the implementation does not correctly handle the reconstruction and sorting steps.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
