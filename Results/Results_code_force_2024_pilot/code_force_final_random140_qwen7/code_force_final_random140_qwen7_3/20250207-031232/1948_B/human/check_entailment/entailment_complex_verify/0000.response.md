### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store the results.
   - It then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads the value of `k` (which is not used in the function) and the list `a` from the input.
   - It converts the string representation of `a` into a list of integers.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `c` to process the elements of `a`.

3. **Processing Elements**:
   - The function iterates over each element in `a`.
   - If an element is greater than 10 and is not the first element, it splits the element into its last digit (`x`) and the remaining part (`y`).
   - It checks if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if `c` is not empty). If true, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order. Otherwise, it appends the entire element `a[i]`.
   - If the element is the first element and greater than 10, it performs similar checks and appends the digits accordingly.
   - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it simply appends it to `c`.

4. **Sorting and Result**:
   - After processing all elements, it sorts `c` and checks if `c` is equal to its sorted version.
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits**:
   - The logic for splitting digits is flawed. For example, if `a[i]` is `45`, the function splits it into `5` and `4`, but it should append them in reverse order (`4` and `5`).

2. **Reconstruction of Array**:
   - The function does not reconstruct the array correctly. It only appends digits to `c` without ensuring that the resulting array is sorted.

3. **Check for Sorted Order**:
   - The function checks if `c` is sorted, but `c` is not necessarily the correct reconstruction of the array after splitting digits.

### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
```

- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
  - Processing:
    - `12` -> `2, 1`
    - `3` -> `3`
    - `45` -> `5, 4`
    - `67` -> `7, 6`
  - Resulting `c`: `[2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6]`
  - Sorting `c`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Since `c` is sorted, the function appends `1` to `b`.

This example shows that the function correctly identifies that the array can be sorted after splitting digits.

However, consider another input:
```
3
3
12 28 5
```

- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `[12, 28, 5]`
  - Processing:
    - `12` -> `2, 1`
    - `28` -> `8, 2`
    - `5` -> `5`
  - Resulting `c`: `[2, 1, 8, 2, 5]`
  - Sorting `c`: `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`
  - Since `c` is not sorted, the function appends `0` to `b`.

This example shows that the function incorrectly identifies that the array cannot be sorted after splitting digits.

### Conclusion:
The program has issues with the logic for splitting digits and reconstructing the array. While it correctly identifies some cases, it fails in others. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
