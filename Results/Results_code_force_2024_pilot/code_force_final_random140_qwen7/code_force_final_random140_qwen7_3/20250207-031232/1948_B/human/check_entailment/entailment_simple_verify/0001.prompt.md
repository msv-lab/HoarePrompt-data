You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store the results for each test case.
2. **Loop Structure**: The outer loop iterates `m` times, but the function `func_1()` is called only once inside this loop, which is incorrect. It should be called `m` times to process each test case.
3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads the size of the array `k` and the array itself.
   - It processes the array according to the problem statement, splitting numbers greater than 10 into their individual digits.
   - It checks if the resulting array `c` is sorted and appends `1` to `b` if it is, otherwise `0`.
4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value stored in `b` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic within `func_1()` is correct and follows the problem statement accurately.
- However, the outer loop structure is incorrect. It should call `func_1()` `m` times instead of just once.

### Corrected Program:
```python
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()

for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in its loop structure, but the core logic within `func_1()` is correct. If the outer loop is fixed to call `func_1()` `m` times, the program will work as intended.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
