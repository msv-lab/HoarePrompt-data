### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store the results for each test case.
2. **Loop Structure**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the outer loop iterates `m` times, but the function `func_1()` is called only once inside this loop. This is indeed incorrect and needs to be fixed.
3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads the size of the array `k` and the array itself.
   - It processes the array according to the problem statement, splitting numbers greater than 10 into their individual digits.
   - It checks if the resulting array `c` is sorted and appends `1` to `b` if it is, otherwise `0`.
4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value stored in `b` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic within `func_1()` is correct and follows the problem statement accurately.
- However, the outer loop structure is incorrect. It should call `func_1()` `m` times to process each test case.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program should look like this:

```python
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()

for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the outer loop structure is incorrect. It should call `func_1()` `m` times.
- The core logic within `func_1()` is correct and follows the problem statement accurately.
- Once the outer loop is corrected to call `func_1()` `m` times, the program will work as intended.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the loop structure, and the core logic is correct. Therefore, the program can be made correct by fixing the loop structure.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

However, if the loop structure is fixed, the program will be correct. Since the original program is not correct due to the loop structure, but the logic within `func_1()` is correct, the final evaluation should reflect the need for correction.

Final: **False**
