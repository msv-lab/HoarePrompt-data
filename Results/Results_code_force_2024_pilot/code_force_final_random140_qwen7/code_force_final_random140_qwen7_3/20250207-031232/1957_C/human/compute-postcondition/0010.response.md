Output State: **The program returns y, which is the sum of x1 and x2.**

Given the initial state, `len` is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after k moves, and `y` is defined as `x1 + x2`. The code snippet simply returns the value of `y`. Since `y` is already calculated as the sum of `x1` and `x2`, the program returns this sum.
