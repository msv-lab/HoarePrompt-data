Output State: **`len` is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and len is greater than 0, and len is not in dp; `x2` is 2 * (len - 1) * `helper(len - 2)`**

Explanation: The variable `x2` is assigned the value `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`. The value of `len` remains unchanged, and `x1` was previously set to `helper(len - 1)`. The output state includes the updated value of `x2` and retains the original conditions for `len`.
