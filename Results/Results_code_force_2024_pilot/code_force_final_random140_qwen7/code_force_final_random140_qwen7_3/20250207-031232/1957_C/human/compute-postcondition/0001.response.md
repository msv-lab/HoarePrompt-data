Output State: **The program returns 1**

Given the initial state where `len` is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and the current value of `len` is less than or equal to 0, the code snippet `return 1` simply returns the integer 1, regardless of the value of `len`. Therefore, the program returns 1.
