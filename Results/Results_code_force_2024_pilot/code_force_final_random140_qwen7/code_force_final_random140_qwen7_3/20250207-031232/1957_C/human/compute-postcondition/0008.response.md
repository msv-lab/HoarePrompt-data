Output State: **`len` is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and len is greater than 0, and len is not in dp; `y` is `x1 + x2`.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is assigned the value of `x1 + x2`. The value of `x2` is given as `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`. The values of `len`, `x1`, and `helper(len - 2)` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the new variable `y` with the value `x1 + x2`, while keeping the other conditions and variables as they were initially.
