You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made.
def helper(len):
    if (len <= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and len is greater than 0
    if (len in dp) :
        return dp[len]
        #The program returns the value stored in dp at the index equal to the current value of len, where len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after k moves have been made.
    #State: len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and len is greater than 0, and len is not in dp
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y
    #The program returns y, which is the sum of x1 and x2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `len`, which is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after k moves have been made. It returns 1 in Case_1, the value stored in dp at the index equal to the current value of `len` in Case_2, and the sum of x1 and x2 in Case_3.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns the value stored in dp at the index equal to the current value of len, where len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after k moves have been made.

Case_3: The program returns y, which is the sum of x1 and x2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
