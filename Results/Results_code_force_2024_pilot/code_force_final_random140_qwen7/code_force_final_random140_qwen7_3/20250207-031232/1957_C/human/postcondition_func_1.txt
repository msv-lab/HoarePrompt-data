The function `helper` accepts a parameter `len`, which is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after k moves have been made. It returns 1 if `len` is less than or equal to 0. If `len` is already computed and stored in `dp`, it returns the stored value. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the result using the values of `len-1` and `len-2`, stores the result in `dp`, and returns it.
