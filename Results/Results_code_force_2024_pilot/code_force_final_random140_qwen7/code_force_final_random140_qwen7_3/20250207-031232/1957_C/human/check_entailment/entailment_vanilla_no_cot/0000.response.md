Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `helper` do not address the problem's requirements in any meaningful way. Specifically:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves counting the number of unique final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after a series of moves where you and the computer place rooks alternately, ensuring no two rooks attack each other. The solution should account for the mirroring effect of the computer's moves and calculate the number of valid configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1` calls `helper` but does not use the result in a way that addresses the problem.
   - `helper` is a recursive function that calculates some values but does not relate to the rook placement problem. It seems to be calculating something related to permutations or combinations, but it does not incorporate the constraints of the rook placement problem.

3. **Solution Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, one needs to consider the remaining positions on the board after the initial \(k\) moves and compute the number of ways to place rooks in those positions without violating the no-attack rule.
   - Given the mirroring effect, the problem can be simplified by focusing on the remaining rows and columns that are not yet occupied by rooks.

4. **Correct Solution Outline**:
   - Calculate the number of free rows and columns after the initial \(k\) moves.
   - Use combinatorial methods to count the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the mirroring effect.

Since the provided code does not implement any of these steps, it cannot be considered correct for solving the given problem.
