### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not implement the solution to the problem as described. Let's break down the issues and verify why the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `func_1` and `helper`**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `helper` with an undefined argument `x`. This makes it impossible to understand how `x` relates to the problem context.
   - The `helper` function is a recursive function that calculates a value based on the length of the remaining positions (`len`). However, this function does not account for the specific constraints of the problem, such as ensuring no two rooks attack each other and handling the mirroring of moves.

2. **Problem Constraints**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations of an \(n \times n\) chessboard after `k` moves, where each move is mirrored by the computer.
   - The `helper` function does not consider the constraints of the problem, such as ensuring that no two rooks are placed in the same row or column after each move.

3. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - The recursive calculation in `helper` does not reflect the combinatorial nature of placing rooks on the board while avoiding attacks. The formula used in `helper` does not correctly model the problem.

4. **Missing Key Components**:
   - The code does not handle the mirroring of moves correctly. Each move by the player is mirrored by the computer, and the function should account for this.
   - The function does not keep track of the positions of the rooks and ensure that no two rooks attack each other after each move.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result needs to be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but the current implementation does not perform this operation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately points out that the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The `helper` function and `func_1` do not account for the necessary constraints and logic required to solve the problem.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
