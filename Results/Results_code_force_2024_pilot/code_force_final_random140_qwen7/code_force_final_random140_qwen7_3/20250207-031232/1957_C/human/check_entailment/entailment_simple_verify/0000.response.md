### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given code and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- You and the computer take turns placing rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard.
- No two rooks can attack each other, meaning they cannot be in the same row or column.
- You start first and make \(k\) moves, and the computer mirrors your moves.
- After the initial \(k\) moves, you need to calculate the number of different final configurations possible.

#### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Functions `func_1` and `helper`:**
   - These functions do not appear to be related to the problem at hand. The `helper` function seems to be implementing a dynamic programming solution for some unrelated problem, likely involving counting something else entirely.
   - The `func_1` function calls `helper` with the input `x`, but `x` is never defined or initialized within the context of the problem.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic in the annotated code subtracts the number of rows and columns affected by the initial \(k\) moves from \(n\).
   - It then calls `func_1(n - k - k)` to get the number of possible configurations.
   - This approach does not correctly handle the constraints and the mirroring effect of the computer's moves.

#### Correct Approach:
- To solve this problem, we need to consider the remaining rows and columns after the initial \(k\) moves.
- For each remaining row and column, we need to count the number of ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.
- The mirroring effect means that the remaining rows and columns must be considered together.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `helper` are not relevant to the problem, and the main logic incorrectly handles the constraints and the mirroring effect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of different final configurations of the chessboard.

**Final: False**
