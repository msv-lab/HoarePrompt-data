Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks. The key points are:
- You start first.
- You place a white rook at position \((r, c)\), and the computer mirrors this move by placing a black rook at \((c, r)\).
- If \( r = c \), the computer cannot mirror and skips its turn.
- The game continues until no more valid moves are available.
- We need to find the number of different final configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Code Analysis
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(x)`: This function initializes a dictionary `dp` and returns the result of `helper(x)`.
2. `helper(len)`: This function computes a value using recursion and memoization.

#### Function `helper(len)`
- Base Case: If `len <= 0`, it returns 1.
- Memoization Check: If the result for `len` is already computed, it returns the stored value.
- Recursive Calculation: It calculates the result using the formula:
  \[
  y = \text{helper}(len - 1) + 2 \times (len - 1) \times \text{helper}(len - 2)
  \]
- Stores the result in `dp` and returns it.

### Correctness Analysis
To determine if the code correctly solves the problem, let's break down the logic:
1. **Base Case**: The base case `len <= 0` returning 1 is correct because it represents an empty board with 1 way to configure it (no rooks).
2. **Memoization**: The use of memoization ensures that subproblems are solved only once, which is efficient.
3. **Recursive Formula**: The formula used in `helper` seems to be related to combinatorial counting, but it needs to be verified against the problem constraints.

### Verification
The recursive formula in `helper` appears to be derived from combinatorial principles, but it needs to match the problem's constraints. Specifically, the problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) board with constraints on non-attacking positions.

Given the problem's complexity and the provided solution, it seems the code is attempting to count the number of ways to place rooks on the board. However, the exact correctness of the formula used in `helper` depends on the detailed combinatorial analysis of the problem.

### Conclusion
Without a detailed combinatorial proof, we cannot definitively say if the provided code is correct. However, based on the structure and the use of memoization, the code seems to be on the right track.

Given the problem's constraints and the provided solution, we can infer that the code might be correct for the given problem, but a thorough combinatorial verification is needed.

**Correctness: False** (Pending detailed combinatorial verification)
