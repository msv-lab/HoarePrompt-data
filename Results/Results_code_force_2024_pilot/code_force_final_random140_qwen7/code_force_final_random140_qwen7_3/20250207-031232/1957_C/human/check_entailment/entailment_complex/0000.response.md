Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where each move is mirrored by the computer. The solution uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place rooks under the given constraints.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function initializes a dictionary `dp` and calls the `helper` function with the remaining size of the chessboard (`x`). The `dp` dictionary is used to store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
   - **helper**: This recursive function calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining rows (or columns). It uses memoization to store previously computed results in the `dp` dictionary. The base case is when `len` (number of rows/columns left) is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns 1. For other cases, it recursively calculates the number of ways by considering placing a rook in the current row/column or skipping it.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `helper` correctly handles the recursive calculation of configurations by considering both placing a rook and not placing a rook in the current row/column.
   - The use of memoization ensures that the function efficiently computes the result without redundant calculations.
   - The overall structure of the program correctly processes each test case, updating the size of the remaining chessboard and calling the appropriate functions.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
