You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(x):
    dp = {}

    return helper(x)

#Function 2:
def helper(len):
    if len <= 0:
        return 1
    if len in dp:
        return dp[len]
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `helper` accepts a parameter `len`, which is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after k moves have been made. It returns 1 if `len` is less than or equal to 0. If `len` is already computed and stored in `dp`, it returns the stored value. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the result using the values of `len-1` and `len-2`, stores the result in `dp`, and returns it.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after `k` moves, where each move is mirrored by the computer.
   - The function should handle multiple test cases and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Given Code**:
   - The code includes two functions: `func_1` and `helper`.
   - `func_1` calls `helper` with an argument `x`, but the value of `x` is not defined in the context of the problem.
   - `helper` is a recursive function that calculates a value based on the length of the remaining positions (`len`).

3. **Recursive Function `helper`**:
   - Base Case: If `len <= 0`, it returns 1.
   - Memoization: Uses a dictionary `dp` to store previously computed values for efficiency.
   - Recursive Calculation: 
     - `x1 = helper(len - 1)` (one less position).
     - `x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)` (two less positions, considering the two ways to place rooks).
     - Returns the sum of `x1` and `x2`.

4. **Integration with Problem**:
   - The function `helper` seems to be calculating something related to the number of configurations, but it does not directly relate to the problem of counting configurations on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after `k` moves.
   - The input `x` to `func_1` is not defined in the context of the problem, making it unclear how this function fits into the solution.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - The recursive function `helper` does not account for the constraints of the problem (e.g., no two rooks attacking each other, mirroring of moves, etc.).
   - The function `func_1` is not defined in terms of the problem parameters (n, k, and the moves).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
