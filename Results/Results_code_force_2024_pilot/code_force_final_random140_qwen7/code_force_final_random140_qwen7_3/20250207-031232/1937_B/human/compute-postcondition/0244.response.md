Postcondition: `work` is `False`, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is 2, `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`, `t` is an unspecified integer, and `ans` is a string containing characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop. The current value of `a[j + 1]` is `'0'`, and the current value of `b[j]` is `'1'`.
