Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `work` is False.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
