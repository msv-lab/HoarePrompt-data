Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is `ans + a[i]`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is either 3 or 4, `a[i]` refers to either `a[3]` or `a[4]`. The value of `ans` is updated accordingly, but the exact value of `ans` depends on its initial value and the values of `a[3]` and `a[4]`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, so it is either 3 or 4.
