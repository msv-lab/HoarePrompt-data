Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `work` is True.**

Explanation:
- If `i + 1 == len(a)`, then `i` becomes 2, and `ans` remains as the first character of `a`.
- If `i + 1 != len(a)`, then `i` remains 2, and `ans` stays as the first character of `a`, with `work` still being True.
