Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True.**

The variable `work` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables with their initial values and the new value of `work`.
