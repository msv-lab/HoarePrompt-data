Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `counter` is 2, `t` is 3, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. This does not affect the values of `j`, `counter`, `t`, `b`, or `ans`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
