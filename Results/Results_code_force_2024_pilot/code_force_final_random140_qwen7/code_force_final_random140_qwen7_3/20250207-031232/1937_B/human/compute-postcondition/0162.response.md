Output State: **`counter` is 1, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `j` is 1, and `ans` will be a concatenation of elements from both `a` and `b` based on the given conditions, if `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1.**

The code `counter = 1` changes the value of `counter` from its initial value of 3 to 1. All other variables (`i`, `work`, `j`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
