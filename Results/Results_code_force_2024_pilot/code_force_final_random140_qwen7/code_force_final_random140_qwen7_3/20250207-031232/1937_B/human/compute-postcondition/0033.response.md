Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is the first character of `a` plus `b[i]`, `work` remains True or is False, and `len(a)` must be at least 3.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` updates the variable `ans` by adding the `i-th` character of `b` to `ans`. The value of `ans` was initially defined as the first character of `a` plus `a[i]`. Now, it is updated to the first character of `a` plus `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
