Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are given, where each `a_{ij}` is either 0 or 1; the function `input` is now used to read input from standard input.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` simply reassigns the `input` function to use `sys.stdin.readline` for reading input from standard input. This does not change the values of any variables or the conditions specified in the initial state.
