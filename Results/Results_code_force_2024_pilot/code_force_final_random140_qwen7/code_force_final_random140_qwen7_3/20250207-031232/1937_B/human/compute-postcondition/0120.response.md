Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is `ans + b[3]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `ans` was being updated to `ans + b[i]`. The value of `i` remains 3, and the expression for `ans` remains `ans + b[3]` because the assignment was not completed.
