Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `work` is False.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Since `i` is initially 0, `ans` is updated to be the first character of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
