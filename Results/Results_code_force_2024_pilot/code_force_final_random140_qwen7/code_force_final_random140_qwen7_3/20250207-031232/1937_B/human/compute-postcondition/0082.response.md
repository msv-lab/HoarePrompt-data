Output State: **`j` is 2, `counter` is 1**.

Explanation: The initial state sets `j` to 2 and `counter` to 3 if `a[3]` equals '1' and `b[2]` equals '1', otherwise `counter` remains 2. The code snippet `counter = 1` directly assigns the value 1 to `counter`, overriding its initial value. Therefore, `counter` is now 1, while `j` retains its initial value of 2.
