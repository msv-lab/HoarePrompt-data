Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is `ans + a[i]`, `work` is `False`**

The variable `work` is set to `False`, which does not affect the values of `i` or `ans`. The initial state of `ans` being `ans + a[i]` remains unchanged because no operation is performed on `ans` or `a[i]` within the given code snippet.
