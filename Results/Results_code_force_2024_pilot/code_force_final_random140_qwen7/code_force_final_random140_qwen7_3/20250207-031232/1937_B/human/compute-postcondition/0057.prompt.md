Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b`, `work` is False if the current value of `b[i]` is less than the current value of `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` remains True or is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is either the first character of `a` plus `a[i]` or the first character of `ans` plus `b[i-1]`, `work` remains the same as before, and `len(a)` must be at least 3.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is either 3 or 4; `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character; `b` is the stripped input from the next user input; `ans` is the first character of `a` plus `a[i]` or the first character of `a` plus `b[i-1]` depending on the value of `work`; `work` remains the same as before; and `len(a)` must be at least 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
