Output State: **`work` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (either 1 or 2), `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the string `ans`. The values of the other variables (`work`, `i`, `counter`, `j`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
