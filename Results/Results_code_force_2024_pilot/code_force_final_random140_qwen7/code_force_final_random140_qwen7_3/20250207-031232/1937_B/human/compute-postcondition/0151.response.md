Postcondition: `counter` is 2, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` will be a concatenation of elements from both `a` and `b` based on the given conditions, `work` is `False`, `j` is 0. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, then `counter` becomes 2. If `a[j + 1]` does not equal `b[j]`, the conditions remain unchanged.
