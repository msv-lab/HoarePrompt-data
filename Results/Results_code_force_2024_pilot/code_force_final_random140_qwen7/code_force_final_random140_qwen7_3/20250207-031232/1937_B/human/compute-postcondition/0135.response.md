Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 5; `ans` is `ans + a[i-1]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 3, it becomes 4, and if it was initially 4, it becomes 5. The value of `ans` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is `ans + a[i]`. Since `i` is now `i+1`, the expression for `ans` updates to `ans + a[i-1]`.
