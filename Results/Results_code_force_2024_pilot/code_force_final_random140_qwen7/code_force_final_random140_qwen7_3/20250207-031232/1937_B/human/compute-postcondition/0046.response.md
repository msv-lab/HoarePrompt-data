Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character; `b` is the stripped input from the next user input; `ans` is the first character of `a` plus `a[i]`; `work` is False.**

Explanation: The line `work = False` sets the variable `work` to `False`. All other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
