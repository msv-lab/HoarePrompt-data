Output State: **`i` is 1, the length of `a` is greater than 0, and the `work` condition is true; `ans` is `a[0] + b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `b[i]` to it. Given that `i` was initially 0, it is now incremented to 1. Since `ans` was initially set to `a[0]`, after executing `ans += b[i]` (where `i` is now 1), `ans` becomes `a[0] + b[0]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
