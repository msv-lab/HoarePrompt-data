Postcondition: `work` is `True`, `i` is 2, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `t` must be `t - 1`, and `ans` is the character `a[0]` appended to the string `ans`. The current value of `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
