Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `work` is False if the current value of `b[i]` is less than the current value of `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` remains True.**
