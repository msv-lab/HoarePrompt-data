Output State: **`i` is 0, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` must be `t - 1`, and `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `i = 0` sets the variable `i` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
