Output State: **`work` is `False`, `i` is 2, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, and `ans` is the first character of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2. The values of `work`, `b`, `counter`, `j`, `t`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
