Output State: **`i` is 1, the length of `a` is greater than 0, and the `work` condition is true; `ans` is `a[0]`, `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
