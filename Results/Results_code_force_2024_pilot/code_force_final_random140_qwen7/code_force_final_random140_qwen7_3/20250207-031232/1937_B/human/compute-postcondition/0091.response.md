Output State: **`j` is 2, `counter` is 2, `t` is 3, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. The values of the other variables (`j`, `counter`, `t`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
