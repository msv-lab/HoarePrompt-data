Output State: **`work` is a boolean, `i` is 4, `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is a string with `a[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial state mentions that `i` is either 3 or 4, incrementing `i` by 1 results in `i` becoming 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
