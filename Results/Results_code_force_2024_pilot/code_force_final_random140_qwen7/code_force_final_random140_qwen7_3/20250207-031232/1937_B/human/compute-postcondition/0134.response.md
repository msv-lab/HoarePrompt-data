Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is `ans + b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `ans` was being updated with `ans + b[i]`. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable values, the values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
