Output State: **`i` is 1, the length of `a` is greater than 0, and the `work` condition is true; `ans` is `a[0] + b[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `i`, the length of `a`, the `work` condition, or `ans`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
