Output State: **`i` is 1, the length of `a` is greater than 0, and the `work` condition is false; `ans` is `a[0]`, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `work` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables (`i`, `a`, `ans`, and `b`) retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
