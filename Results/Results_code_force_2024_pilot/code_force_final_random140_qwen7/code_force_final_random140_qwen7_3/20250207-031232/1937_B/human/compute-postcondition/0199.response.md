Postcondition: `work` is `True`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `t` must be `t - 1`, and `ans` is the character `a[0]` appended to the string `ans`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `i` is set to 2, and `ans` is the character `b[2]` appended to the string `ans` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `i` remains as 1, and `ans` remains as the character `a[0]` appended to the string `ans`.
