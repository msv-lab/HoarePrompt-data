Output State: **`i` is 0, the length of `a` is greater than 0, and the `work` condition is true; `ans` is `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by `a[i]`, where `i` is 0. Since `a` has more than 0 elements and `work` is true, `a[0]` is added to `ans`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only modifies `ans`.
