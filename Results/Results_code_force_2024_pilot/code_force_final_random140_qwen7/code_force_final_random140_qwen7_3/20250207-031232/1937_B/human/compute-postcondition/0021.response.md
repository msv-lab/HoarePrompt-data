Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `work` is True**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 1. After executing the code, `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
