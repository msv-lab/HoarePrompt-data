Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings `a_1` and `a_2` of length `n` (each consisting of 0s and 1s). It does not return a specific value but processes the input data according to the given constraints.**
