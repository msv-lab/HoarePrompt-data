Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `work` is `True`, `i` is 0, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `t` must be `t - 1`, and `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `work` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is a string. If `work` is `True`, then `i` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the character `a[0]` appended to the string `ans`, and if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `i` is set to 2, and `ans` is the character `b[2]` appended to the string `ans` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `i` remains as 1, and `ans` remains as the character `a[0]` appended to the string `ans`. If `work` is `False`, then `i` is 2, and `ans` is the first character of `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `work` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (either 2 or 3), `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is a string. If `work` is true and `i` is 1 or 2, then `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `a[i]` if certain conditions are met, otherwise `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`. If `work` is true and `i` is 2 or 3, then `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `b[i-1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `work` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (either 4 or 5), `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is a string. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `work` remains False and `ans` is appended with `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `i` becomes 4 and `ans` is appended with `b[i-2]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
