Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is the first character of `ans` plus `b[i]`, `work` remains the same as before, and `len(a)` must be at least 3.**

Explanation: The line `ans += b[i]` adds the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, as well as the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `work`, and `len(a)`. The updated value of `ans` is the concatenation of its original value and the character `b[i]`.
