Output State: **`j` is 2, `counter` is 3 if `a[2]` equals '0' and `b[1]` equals '1', otherwise `counter` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `counter` is 2 if `a[2]` equals '0' and `b[1]` equals '1', otherwise `counter` remains 1. After executing `counter += 1`, if the conditions for `counter` being 2 were met, `counter` will now be 3. If the conditions were not met, `counter` will remain 2. The value of `j` is not affected by this operation.
