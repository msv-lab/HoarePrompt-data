Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which in this case only involves `n`. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is an input integer.
