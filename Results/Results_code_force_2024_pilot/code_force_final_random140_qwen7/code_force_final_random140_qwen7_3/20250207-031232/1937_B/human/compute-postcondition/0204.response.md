Postcondition: `work` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is a string. If `work` is `True`, then `i` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the character `a[0]` appended to the string `ans`, and if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `i` is set to 2, and `ans` is the character `b[2]` appended to the string `ans` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `i` remains as 1, and `ans` remains as the character `a[0]` appended to the string `ans`. If `work` is `False`, then `i` is 2, and `ans` is the first character of `b`.
