Postcondition: `i` is either 2 or 3, and `ans` is updated based on the following conditions:
- If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is either `a[0] + a[1]` or `b[0] + a[1]`.
- If `i + 1 == len(a)`, then `ans` is either `a[0] + b[0] + a[1]` or `b[0] + a[1]`.
- If `i` is 2, then `ans` is increased by `b[1]`.
