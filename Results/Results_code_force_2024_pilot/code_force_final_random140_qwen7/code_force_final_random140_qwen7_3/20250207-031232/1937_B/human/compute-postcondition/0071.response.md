Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `j` is 0
- `counter` is 1 if `a[j + 1]` equals '0' and `b[j]` equals '1'; otherwise, `j` remains 0.

### Loop Head:
```
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < len(a) - 1`.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
3. **Increment of `j`**: Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`j`**: It will be incremented by 1 from 0 to 1.
- **`counter`**: The value of `counter` depends on the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`. Since `j` is now 1, we need to check the condition `a[1] == '0' and b[0] == '1'`.

### New State:
- `j` is 1.
- `counter` is 1 if `a[1]` equals '0' and `b[0]` equals '1'; otherwise, `j` remains 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is 1, `counter` is 1 if `a[1]` equals '0' and `b[0]` equals '1'; otherwise, `j` remains 1**.
