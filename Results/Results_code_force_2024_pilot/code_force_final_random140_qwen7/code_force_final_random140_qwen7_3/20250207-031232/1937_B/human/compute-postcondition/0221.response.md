Output State: **`work` is False, `i` is 3 or 4, `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is a string with `a[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The variable `work` is explicitly set to `False`. The values of `i`, `b`, `counter`, `j`, `t`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
