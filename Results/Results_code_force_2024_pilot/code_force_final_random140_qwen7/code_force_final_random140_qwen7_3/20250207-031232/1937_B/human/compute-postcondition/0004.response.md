Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still an input integer.
