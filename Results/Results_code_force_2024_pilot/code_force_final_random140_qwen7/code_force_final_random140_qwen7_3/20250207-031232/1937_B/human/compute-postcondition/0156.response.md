Postcondition: `counter` is either 2 or remains 1, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` will be a concatenation of elements from both `a` and `b` based on the given conditions, `work` is `False`, `j` is 0, and if `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is incremented to 2; otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
