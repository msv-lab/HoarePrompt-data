Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `counter` is 2, `t` is 3, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True.**

The code `work = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `work`. No other variables are affected, and the initial values of the other variables remain unchanged.
