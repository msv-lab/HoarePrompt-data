Output State: **`j` is 2, `counter` is 2, `t` is 3, `a` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, converts it to a string, and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `j`, `counter`, and `t` remain unchanged. The new variable `a` is assigned the stripped input string.
