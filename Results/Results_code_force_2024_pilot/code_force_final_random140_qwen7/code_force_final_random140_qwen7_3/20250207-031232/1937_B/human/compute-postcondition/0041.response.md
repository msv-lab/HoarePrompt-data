Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is the first character of `ans` plus `b[i-1]`, `work` remains the same as before, and `len(a)` must be at least 3.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was either 1 or 2, so now `i` is either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
