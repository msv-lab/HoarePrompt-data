Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` remain unchanged**.

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to the integer value read from the input, while `n`, the two binary strings, and the initial conditions regarding their ranges and values remain unchanged.
