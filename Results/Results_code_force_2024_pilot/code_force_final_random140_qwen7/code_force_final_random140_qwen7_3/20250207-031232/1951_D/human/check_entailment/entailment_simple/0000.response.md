Reasoning:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the requirements and the current implementation:

### Problem Requirements:
- Alice has `n` coins.
- Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with prices ranging from 1 to \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily, meaning she buys as many jewels as possible from each stall before moving to the next.

### Current Implementation Issues:
1. **Function `func_1()` Logic:**
   - The function takes no input arguments but reads `n` and `k` from standard input.
   - It checks if `n < k` and prints "NO" if true.
   - If `n >= k`, it further checks if `n == k` and prints "YES" followed by 1 stall with price 1.
   - If `n > k`, it incorrectly assumes that setting up 2 stalls with specific prices will always work, which is not necessarily true.

2. **Specific Cases:**
   - For the case where `n == k`, the solution is correct.
   - For the case where `n > k`, the current logic does not handle the general scenario correctly. Specifically, it does not ensure that Alice ends up buying exactly `k` jewels by setting up the appropriate number of stalls and prices.

### Example Analysis:
- **Case 1: Input `7 3`**
  - Alice has 7 coins and needs to buy 3 jewels.
  - The current code correctly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 2, allowing Alice to buy 3 jewels.
- **Case 2: Input `6 4`**
  - Alice has 6 coins and needs to buy 4 jewels.
  - The current code incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not consider the possibility of setting up stalls to achieve the desired outcome.
- **Case 3: Input `255 8`**
  - Alice has 255 coins and needs to buy 8 jewels.
  - The current code incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not consider the possibility of setting up stalls to achieve the desired outcome.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Determine the number of stalls needed.
2. Set the prices of the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        stalls = min(k, 60)
        print(stalls)
        for i in range(1, stalls + 1):
            print(i, end=' ')
        print()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all cases where Alice needs to buy exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
