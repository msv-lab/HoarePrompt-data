### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. We need to check if the given solution correctly handles all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` (number of coins) and `k` (number of jewels).
   - It checks three main conditions:
     - If `n < k`, Alice cannot buy even one jewel, so the output should be "NO".
     - If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly one jewel at a stall priced at 1 coin, so the output should be "YES" with 1 stall and price 1.
     - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, Alice can buy `k-1` jewels at the first stall and the remaining `k-(k-1)` jewels at another stall. The price for the first stall would be `n - k + 1` and the price for the second stall would be 1. So, the output should be "YES" with 2 stalls and appropriate prices.
     - Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

3. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - The condition `n < k` is handled correctly.
   - The condition `n == k` is handled correctly.
   - The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is also handled correctly, ensuring that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The remaining cases are handled by returning "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the edge case when `n == k`.
   - The code correctly handles the case when `k - 1 < n - k + 1`.
   - The code correctly handles other cases by returning "NO".

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
