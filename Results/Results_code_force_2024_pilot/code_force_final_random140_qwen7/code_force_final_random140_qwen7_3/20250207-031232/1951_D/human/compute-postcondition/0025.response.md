Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases within a loop where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each t, two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It does not return a value explicitly but processes each test case based on the given constraints.**

This means the function likely iterates over a series of test cases, each containing values for `t`, `n`, and `k`, and performs some operation based on these values without returning a result outside of its scope.
