You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')
                #This is printed: YES
                print(2)
                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: n - k + 1 1
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: NO
            #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and n is greater than k. If the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is satisfied, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition `(k - 1 ≥ n - k + 1)` holds true.
        #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` equals `k`, then `n` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is satisfied, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition `(k - 1 ≥ n - k + 1)` holds true.
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `n` is less than `k`, then `n` remains unchanged and `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and if `n` equals `k`, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` does not equal `k`, then the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is checked. If the condition is true, `n` remains unchanged. If the condition is false, then `(k - 1 ≥ n - k + 1)` holds true.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases within a loop where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each t, two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It does not return a value explicitly but processes each test case based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
