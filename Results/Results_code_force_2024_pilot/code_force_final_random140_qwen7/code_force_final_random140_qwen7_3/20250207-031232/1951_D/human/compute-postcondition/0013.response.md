Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `n` is greater than `k`.
- The condition \((k - 1 < n - k + 1)\) is satisfied.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`, as long as the condition \((k - 1 < n - k + 1)\) is met.

Output: **YES**
