The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, it checks if n is less than k. If so, it prints 'NO'. If n equals k, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 twice. If n is greater than k and the condition (k - 1 < n - k + 1) is satisfied, it prints 'YES' followed by 2 and two integers representing the values of n - k + 1 and 1. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
