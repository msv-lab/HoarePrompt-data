t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers a (a[i] is either 0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 means the cell is free and 1 means the cell contains a chip. Additionally, in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
