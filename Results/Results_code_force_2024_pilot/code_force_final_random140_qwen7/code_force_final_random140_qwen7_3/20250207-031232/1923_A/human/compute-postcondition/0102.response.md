Postcondition: `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, and the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`. Additionally, if `arrs[0]` is equal to 1, then `arrs[idx]` is 1 and `cnt0` is incremented by 1 if `arrs[idx]` is 0. If `arrs[0]` is not equal to 1, no changes are made to `arrs` and `cnt0`.
