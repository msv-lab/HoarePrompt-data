Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt0 = 0
    for idx in range(len(arrs)):
        if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
            if arrs[idx] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
        elif arrs[0] == 1:
            if arrs[idx] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
    cnt1 = 0
    for idx in range(len(arrs)):
        if arrs[idx] == 1:
            cnt1 += 1
    if arrs[0] == 0:
        if arrs[len(arrs) - 1] == 0:
            cnt0 -= 1
    ans = 0
    if cnt1 == 1 or cnt1 == 0:
        ans = 0
    else:
        ans = cnt0
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1; `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements; `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in the list `arrs`; the first element of `arrs` is 0; if the current value of `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, `ans` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is `cnt0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, `idx` is equal to -1, and the first element of `arrs` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, `cnt0` is either the initial value minus 1 (if the last element of `arrs` is 0) or retains its initial value (if the last element of `arrs` is not 0), and `ans` is either 0 or `cnt0` depending on whether `cnt1` equals 1 or 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
