Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, and `cnt0` is either 4 or 3 depending on the value of the element at index 1 in `arrs`.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt0` was either 3 or 2 before the increment, it will now be either 4 or 3, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
