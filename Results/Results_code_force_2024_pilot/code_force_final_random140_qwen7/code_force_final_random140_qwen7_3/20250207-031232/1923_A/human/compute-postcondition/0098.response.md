Output State: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, and the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`. Additionally, `arrs[0]` is equal to 1, `arrs[idx]` is 0, and `cnt0` is equal to `cnt0` plus 1.**

In this case, `cnt0` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `cnt0` before the increment is not specified. However, we know that `cnt0` was previously set to a value that made `arrs[idx]` equal to 0, and now it has been incremented by 1.
