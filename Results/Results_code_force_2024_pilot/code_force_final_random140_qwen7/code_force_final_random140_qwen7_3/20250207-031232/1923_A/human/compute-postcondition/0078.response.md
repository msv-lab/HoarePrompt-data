Output State: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1; `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements; `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in the list `arrs`; the first element of `arrs` is 0; `ans` is `cnt0`; `cnt1` is neither equal to 1 nor equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = cnt0` assigns the value of `cnt0` to `ans`. Since `cnt0` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a variable that holds a specific value. The other variables remain unchanged.
