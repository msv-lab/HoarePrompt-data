Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, `idx` is equal to -1, and the first element of `arrs` is 0.**

The code `ans = 0` simply reassigns the variable `ans` to 0. Since the initial value of `ans` was also 0, this assignment does not change its value. The values of `cnt1`, `idx`, and the first element of `arrs` remain unchanged from their initial states.
