Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `idx` will be equal to -1 (since it starts from the length of `arrs` minus 1 and decreases by 1 each iteration until it goes below 0), `arrs` will be a list of integers updated from user input, and the length of `arrs` will be the length of the updated list `arrs`. Additionally, `cnt0` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 0 in `arrs` except when `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is also 0 (in which case `cnt0` is not incremented). The value of `ans` will be 0 if `cnt1` (the total number of 1s in `arrs`) is either 1 or 0, otherwise `ans` will be the final value of `cnt0`. 

In summary, `cnt0` will count the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and `ans` will be determined based on the count of ones (`cnt1`) and the final count of zeros (`cnt0`).
