Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, but this value is not needed to determine what is printed by the `print(ans)` statement.
- `idx` is equal to -1, but this value is also not needed for the current print statement.
- The first element of `arrs` is 0, but again, this is not relevant to the current print statement.

The `print(ans)` statement will simply print the value of the variable `ans`, which is explicitly given as 0.

Output: **0**
