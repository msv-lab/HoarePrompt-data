Output State: **The final value of `cnt1` will be the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, and `idx` will be equal to -1.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all iterations, `idx` will have gone through each index of the list `arrs` starting from the last index and moving towards the first index. Once it has iterated over all elements, `idx` will become -1 (since it is decremented by 1 after the last iteration). The variable `cnt1` will hold the count of all 1s encountered in the list `arrs` during the iterations of the loop. All other variables (`arrs`, which remains unchanged, `ans`, which is undefined throughout the process, and `t`, which is not mentioned in the loop but assumed to be decremented once per iteration) will retain their states as they were initially or as they were left after the last iteration of the loop.
