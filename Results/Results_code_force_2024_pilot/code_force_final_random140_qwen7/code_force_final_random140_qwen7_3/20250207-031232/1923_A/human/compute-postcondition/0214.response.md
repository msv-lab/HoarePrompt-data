Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an index within the list that must be less than `len(arrs)` and equal to the current `idx + 1`, and `cnt1` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt1 += 1` increments the value of `cnt1` by 1. The other variables (`arrs` and `idx`) remain unchanged. The condition that `idx` is an index within the list and equal to `idx + 1` remains valid, which implies `idx` must be the last index of the list (since `idx + 1` would exceed the list length). However, the exact value of `cnt1` is not specified initially, only that it is increased by 1.
