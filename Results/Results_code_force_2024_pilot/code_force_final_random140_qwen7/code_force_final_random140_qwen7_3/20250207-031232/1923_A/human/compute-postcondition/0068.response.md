Output State: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1; `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements; `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in the list `arrs`; the first element of `arrs` is 0; the last element of `arrs` is 0; `cnt0` is reduced by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt0 -= 1` decreases the value of `cnt0` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
