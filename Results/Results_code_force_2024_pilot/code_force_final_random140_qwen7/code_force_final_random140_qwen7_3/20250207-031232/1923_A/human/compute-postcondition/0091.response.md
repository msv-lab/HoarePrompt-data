Postcondition: `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`, the first element of `arrs` is 0, `idx` is not 0, and if `arrs[idx]` is equal to 0, then `cnt0` is equal to 1. If `arrs[idx]` is not equal to 0, then `cnt0` remains unchanged.
