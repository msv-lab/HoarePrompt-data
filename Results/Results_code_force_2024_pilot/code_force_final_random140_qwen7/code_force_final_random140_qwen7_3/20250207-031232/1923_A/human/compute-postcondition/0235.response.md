Postcondition: **`idx` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, `cnt0` is either the initial value minus 1 (if the last element of `arrs` is 0) or retains its initial value (if the last element of `arrs` is not 0), and `ans` is 0, with the condition that `cnt1` is neither equal to 1 nor equal to 0**
