Output State: **`cnt1` is 0, `idx` is equal to `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is incremented by 1 for each 0 encountered in `arrs` except when `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `cnt1` to 0, which was already zero due to the initial state. The values of `idx` and `cnt0` remain unchanged from their initial state.
