Output State: **`idx` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, `cnt0` is either the initial value minus 1 (if the last element of `arrs` is 0) or retains its initial value (if the last element of `arrs` is not 0), and `ans` is `cnt0`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `cnt0` to `ans`. Since `cnt0` is defined as being either the initial value minus 1 (if the last element of `arrs` is 0) or retaining its initial value (if the last element of `arrs` is not 0), `ans` now holds the same value as `cnt0`. The other variables (`idx`, `cnt1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
