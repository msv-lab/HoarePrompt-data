Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, `idx` is equal to -1, the first element of `arrs` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This changes the value of `arrs` to a new list of integers, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial values of `ans`, `cnt1`, `idx`, `t`, and `length` are preserved, and `arrs` is now a list of integers.
