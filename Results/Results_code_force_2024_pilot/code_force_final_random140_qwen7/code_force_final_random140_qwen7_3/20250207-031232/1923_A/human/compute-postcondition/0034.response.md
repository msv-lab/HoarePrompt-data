Postcondition: `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, and `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 depending on the second element of `arrs`. If the element at index `idx` (which is 1) in `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains 2.
