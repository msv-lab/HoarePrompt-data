Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 depending on the second element of `arrs`, and `idx` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt0` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt0` was either 1 or 2 before the increment, it will now be either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
