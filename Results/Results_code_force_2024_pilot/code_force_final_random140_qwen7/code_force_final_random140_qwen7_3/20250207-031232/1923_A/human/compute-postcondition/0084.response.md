Output State: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1; `arrs` is updated to a list of integers from user input; `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in the new list `arrs`; the first element of `arrs` is 0; if the current value of `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, `ans` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is `cnt0`; `t` is decreased by 1; `length` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers, updating the existing `arrs` list. All other variables remain unchanged, including `idx`, `cnt1`, `ans`, `t`, and `length`.
