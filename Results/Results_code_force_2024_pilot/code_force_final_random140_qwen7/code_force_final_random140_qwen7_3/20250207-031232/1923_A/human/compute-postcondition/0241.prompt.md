You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers a (a[i] is either 0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 means the cell is free and 1 means the cell contains a chip. Additionally, in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.

            ans = cnt0
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `idx` will be equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1; `cnt1` will be the total number of 1s in the list `arrs`; `cnt0` will be the total number of 0s in the list `arrs` minus 1 if the last element of `arrs` is 0, or it will retain its initial value if the last element is 1; `ans` will be 0 if `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, otherwise `ans` will be `cnt0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each test case within `t`, it accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. The function returns the count of cells containing chips (represented by 1s) in each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
