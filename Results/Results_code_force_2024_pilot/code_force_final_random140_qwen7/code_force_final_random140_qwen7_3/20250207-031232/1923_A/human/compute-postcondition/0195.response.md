Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `idx` and `arrs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index in the range of `len(arrs)`. This means `idx` will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches the length of `arrs`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `cnt0` is incremented by 1 if `arrs[idx]` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `idx` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `idx` would be 2.
   - The value of `cnt0` will depend on whether `arrs[2]` is 0 or not. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states based on the loop head variables, we do not need to change `cnt0` here.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `idx` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - `arrs` remains unchanged as it is an external list and not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`idx` is 2, `arrs` is the same list**
