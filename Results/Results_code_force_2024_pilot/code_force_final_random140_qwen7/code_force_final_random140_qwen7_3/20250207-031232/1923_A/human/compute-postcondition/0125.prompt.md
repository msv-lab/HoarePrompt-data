Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1; `arrs` is updated to a list of integers from user input; `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in the new list `arrs`; the first element of `arrs` is 0; `cnt0` is 0; `ans` is 0 if `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, otherwise `ans` is `cnt0`; `t` is decreased by 1; `length` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
    elif arrs[0] == 1:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, and the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`. Additionally, if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is equal to 1. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` remains unchanged. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `arrs[idx]` is 1 and `cnt0` is incremented by 1 if `arrs[idx]` is 0. If `arrs[0]` is not 1, no changes are made to `arrs` and `cnt0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 2, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, and the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`. Additionally, if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is equal to 2. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` remains unchanged. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `arrs[idx]` is 1 and `cnt0` is incremented by 1 if `arrs[idx]` is 0. If `arrs[0]` is not 1, no changes are made to `arrs` and `cnt0`. In both cases, `cnt0` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1, `cnt0` is incremented by 1 if `arrs[idx]` is equal to 0, and `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, and the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
