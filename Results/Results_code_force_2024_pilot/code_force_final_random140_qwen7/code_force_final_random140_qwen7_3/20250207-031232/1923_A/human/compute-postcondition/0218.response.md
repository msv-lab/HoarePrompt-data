Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is increased by 1 if arrs[0] is equal to 1**

Explanation: The code `cnt1 += 1` increments the value of `cnt1` by 1. However, the condition for incrementing `cnt1` by 1 (i.e., whether `arrs[0]` is equal to 1) is not directly affected by this line of code. The initial state of `cnt1` being increased by 1 if `arrs[0]` is equal to 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cnt1` based on the initial condition.
