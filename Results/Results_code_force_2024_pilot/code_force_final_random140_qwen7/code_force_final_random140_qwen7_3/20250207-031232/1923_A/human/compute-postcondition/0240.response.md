Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each test case within `t`, it accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. The function returns the count of cells containing chips (represented by 1s) in each test case.**
