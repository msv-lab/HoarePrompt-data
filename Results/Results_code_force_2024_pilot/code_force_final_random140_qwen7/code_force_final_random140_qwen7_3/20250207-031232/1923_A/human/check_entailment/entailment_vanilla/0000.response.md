Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `length` and the array `arrs` representing the cells.

2. **Counting Zeros (`cnt0`):**
   - The code attempts to count the number of zeros (`0`) that appear after the first non-zero element.
   - This is done using a loop that iterates through the array starting from the second element (`idx != 0`).
   - However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly handle the scenario where the first element is `1`.

3. **Counting Ones (`cnt1`):**
   - The code counts the number of ones (`1`) in the array.
   - This part is correct.

4. **Adjusting Zero Count:**
   - If the first element is `0`, the code subtracts 1 from `cnt0`. This adjustment is unnecessary and incorrect because it does not account for the correct position of the first `1`.

5. **Determining the Result:**
   - The result is determined based on the counts of zeros and ones.
   - If there is only one `1` or no `1`s, the result is `0`.
   - Otherwise, the result is set to `cnt0`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Counting of Zeros:**
   - The logic for counting zeros after the first non-zero element is flawed. It should count zeros until the last `1` appears.
   
2. **Unnecessary Adjustment:**
   - Subtracting 1 from `cnt0` when the first element is `0` is incorrect and unnecessary.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Result:**
   - The logic for determining the result is based on the count of zeros, which is not always correct. The correct approach should be to count the gaps between consecutive `1`s.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to count the gaps between consecutive `1`s. The number of operations required will be equal to the number of gaps minus one.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the indices of all 1s
        ones_indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(arrs) if x == 1]
        
        # Calculate the number of gaps between consecutive 1s
        num_gaps = len(ones_indices) - 1
        
        # Print the result
        print(num_gaps)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for counting zeros and the unnecessary adjustments. The corrected program above addresses these issues and should provide the correct result.

**Correctness: False**
