Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the logic to count `cnt0` (the number of consecutive zeros) is flawed. The program incorrectly counts zeros that are not part of the initial segment of zeros, which can lead to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The correct output should be `1`, as moving the chip in the 7th cell to the 5th cell achieves the goal. However, the current implementation would incorrectly count the zeros and produce an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should correctly identify the segment of zeros that need to be moved and count only those zeros. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the first chip
        start = None
        for i in range(length):
            if arrs[i] == 1:
                start = i
                break
        
        # Count the number of zeros to the left of the first chip
        cnt0 = 0
        for i in range(start):
            if arrs[i] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
        
        # Count the number of chips to the right of the first chip
        cnt1 = 0
        for i in range(start, length):
            if arrs[i] == 1:
                cnt1 += 1
        
        # The minimum number of operations is the number of zeros to the left of the first chip
        ans = cnt0
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the segment of zeros that need to be moved and counts only those zeros, ensuring the correct minimum number of operations is calculated.
