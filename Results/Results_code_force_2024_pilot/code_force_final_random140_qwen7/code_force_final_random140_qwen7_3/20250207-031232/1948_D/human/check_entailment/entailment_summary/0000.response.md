Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring by replacing '?' with lowercase Latin letters. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Function `func_1` is not correctly implemented**: The function iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats but does not properly handle the replacement of '?' with specific characters to maximize the tandem repeat length.
2. **Counting mechanism**: The `count` variable is incremented without considering the actual characters being matched. It should check if the characters are either equal or both '?', and then replace '?' appropriately.
3. **Return value**: The function returns `count * 2` when a tandem repeat of length `j` is found, but this approach does not ensure the maximum possible tandem repeat length. It simply checks for any tandem repeat of length `j` without attempting to fill '?' with appropriate characters to maximize the repeat length.
4. **Handling '?'**: The function does not attempt to replace '?' with specific characters to form the longest possible tandem repeat. It only checks if the characters are equal or both '?'.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
