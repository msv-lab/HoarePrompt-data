### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the string `s`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat. However, the logic within the function is flawed.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The outer loop iterates backward from `n // 2` to `1`. This is intended to check for tandem repeats of increasing lengths.
   - The inner loop checks for potential tandem repeats of length `j` starting from index `k` to `n - j`.
   - The `count` variable is used to keep track of consecutive matching characters. If a mismatch is found, `count` is reset to 0.
   - If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `j` has been found, and the function prints `count * 2` and returns, which is correct.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function `func_1()` has a return statement at the end, which will always execute regardless of whether a tandem repeat is found or not. This means that if no tandem repeat is found, the function will still return 0, which is incorrect because the function should return 0 only if no tandem repeat is possible.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle cases where the entire string consists of question marks. In such cases, it should return 0, but the current implementation might not handle this correctly.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1()` is incorrect because it always returns 0 at the end, even if a tandem repeat is found. The correct approach would be to remove the final `return 0` statement and ensure that the function only returns 0 if no tandem repeat is found.

### Correctness:

**False**

The program needs to be corrected to ensure that it returns the correct result based on whether a tandem repeat is found or not.
