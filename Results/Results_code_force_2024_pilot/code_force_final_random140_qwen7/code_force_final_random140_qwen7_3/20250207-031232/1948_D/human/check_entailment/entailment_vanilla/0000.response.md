Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The string `s` is converted into a list of characters.
   - The length of the string `n` is calculated.
   - The function `func_1()` is called to process the string.

3. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - This function attempts to find the longest possible tandem repeat substring by iterating over possible lengths of the tandem repeat from the middle of the string to the smallest possible length.
   - For each possible length `j`, it checks if the substring of length `2*j` can be a tandem repeat.
   - It uses a `count` variable to keep track of consecutive positions where the characters match or are question marks.
   - If `count` equals `j`, it means we have found a tandem repeat of length `2*j`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Handling Question Marks:**
   - The program does not handle question marks properly. It should consider replacing question marks with any lowercase Latin letter to maximize the tandem repeat length.
   - The current logic only checks if the characters at the positions `k` and `k+j` are either equal or question marks, but it does not attempt to replace question marks to form a tandem repeat.

2. **Algorithm Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` is flawed because it does not attempt to replace question marks to form the longest possible tandem repeat. Instead, it just checks if the existing characters form a tandem repeat without considering replacements.

### Conclusion

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
