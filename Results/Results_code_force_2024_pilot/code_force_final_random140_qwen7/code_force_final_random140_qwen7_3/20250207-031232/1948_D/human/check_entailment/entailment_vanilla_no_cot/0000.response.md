Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incomplete Function**: The function `func_1()` is defined but not implemented properly. It does not handle the replacement of '?' with any lowercase Latin letter before checking for tandem repeats.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic inside `func_1()` checks for tandem repeats but does not handle the case where '?' needs to be replaced. It simply checks if the current character and its corresponding character match or if either is '?'. This does not ensure that the maximum possible tandem repeat length is achieved.

3. **Return Statement**: The function returns `0` at the end without considering any tandem repeats found during the loop, which is incorrect.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
- Replace each '?' with a character that maximizes the tandem repeat length.
- Check for the longest possible tandem repeat after replacements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    
    # Try replacing '?' with each possible lowercase letter
    for char in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
        new_s = s.replace('?', char)
        for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
            count = 0
            for k in range(0, n - j):
                if new_s[k] == new_s[k + j]:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count = 0
                if count == j:
                    max_length = max(max_length, j * 2)
                    break
            if max_length > 0:
                break
    print(max_length)
```

This version tries each possible lowercase letter for '?' and then checks for the longest tandem repeat, ensuring the maximum possible length is found.
