Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring in the given string `s`. A tandem repeat is defined as a substring where the first half is equal to the second half.

2. **Loop Logic**: The function iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats starting from the middle of the string (`n // 2`) down to 1. For each possible length `j`, it checks if there exists a substring of length `2 * j` that forms a tandem repeat.

3. **Count Mechanism**: Inside the loop, a `count` variable is used to keep track of consecutive matching pairs. If a pair matches (either both are question marks or both are the same character), `count` is incremented. If a mismatch occurs, `count` is reset to 0.

4. **Termination Condition**: If `count` reaches `j` at any point, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the function prints `count * 2` and returns, effectively terminating the search for longer tandem repeats.

5. **Final Return**: If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, the function returns 0.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases where no tandem repeat can be formed, as it returns 0 in such scenarios.

7. **Input Handling**: The input handling part of the program reads the number of test cases and the strings for each case, which is correctly passed to `func_1`.

Given the above points, the function logic and the overall structure of the program correctly implement the required functionality to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring.

Correctness: **True**
