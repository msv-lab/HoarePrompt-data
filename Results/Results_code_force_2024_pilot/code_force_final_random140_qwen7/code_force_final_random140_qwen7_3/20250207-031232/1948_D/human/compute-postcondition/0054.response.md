Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\).
- `count` is 2 if either `s[k]` is a question mark, `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`; otherwise, `count` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.
- `k` is one more than its previous value.

We need to determine the value of `count * 2` and print it.

From the description, `count` can only be 2 under specific conditions. These conditions are:
1. `s[k]` is a question mark.
2. `s[k + j]` is a question mark.
3. `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.

Since these conditions must be met for `count` to be 2, let's assume the conditions are satisfied (as per the problem's setup, we don't have specific values for `s`, `k`, or `j` to check the exact condition).

Therefore, `count` is 2.

So, `count * 2` would be \(2 * 2 = 4\).

Output: **4**
