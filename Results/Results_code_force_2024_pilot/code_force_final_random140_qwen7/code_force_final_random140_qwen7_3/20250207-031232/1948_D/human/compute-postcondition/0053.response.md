Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), `count` is 2 if either `s[k]` is a question mark, `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`; otherwise, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2 - 1, and `k` is one more than its previous value.
