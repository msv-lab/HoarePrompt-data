Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `k`, `n`, and `j`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `k < n - j`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\).
   - `count` is 1 if either the k-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+j)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the k-th character of `s` is equal to the (k+j)-th character of `s`; otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is not equal to `j`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is currently 0, the loop will run as long as `k < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - Therefore, `k` is now `k + 1`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `k` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `j` remains unchanged.

6. **New State**:
   - `t` remains the same: \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `s` remains the same: a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\).
   - `count` remains the same: 1 if either the k-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+j)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the k-th character of `s` is equal to the (k+j)-th character of `s`; otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `j` remains 0.
   - `count` remains not equal to `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), `count` is 1 if either the (k+1)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+1+j)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+1)-th character of `s` is equal to the (k+1+j)-th character of `s`; otherwise, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is 0, and `count` is not equal to `j`.**
