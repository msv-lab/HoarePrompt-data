Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `s`: A string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks with a length between 1 and 5000.
   - `count`: This variable is set to 1 if any of the following conditions are met:
     - `s[k]` is a question mark (`?`).
     - `s[k + j]` is a question mark (`?`).
     - `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.
   - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - `n`: Must be greater than 1.
   - `j`: Defined as `n // 2 - 1`.
   - The condition `count == j` is true.

2. **Analyzing the Condition:**
   - Since `count == j` is true, it means `count` must be equal to `n // 2 - 1`.
   - Given that `count` is set to 1 under certain conditions, the only way for `count` to be `n // 2 - 1` is if there are multiple positions in the string `s` where the conditions for setting `count` to 1 are met.

3. **Determining the Value of `count`:**
   - For `count` to be `n // 2 - 1`, there must be `n // 2 - 1` instances where one of the conditions for setting `count` to 1 is met.
   - This implies that there are multiple positions in the string `s` where either a question mark is found, or characters match at specific offsets.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The print statement is `print(count * 2)`.
   - Since `count` is `n // 2 - 1`, the expression `count * 2` becomes `(n // 2 - 1) * 2`.

Given that `n > 1`, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n` which is 2:
- If `n = 2`, then `j = 2 // 2 - 1 = 0`, and `count` must be 0, which contradicts the condition `count == j`.
- Therefore, `n` must be at least 3.
- For `n = 3`, `j = 3 // 2 - 1 = 0`, and `count` must be 0, again contradicting the condition.
- For `n = 4`, `j = 4 // 2 - 1 = 1`, and `count` must be 1, which is consistent with the condition.

Thus, the smallest valid `n` is 4, and `count` is 1. Therefore, `count * 2` is `1 * 2 = 2`.

Output: **2**
