You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each testcase, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The total length of all strings s over all testcases does not exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final value of `count` is either equal to `n - j` (if the condition `count == j` was met at least once during the loop's execution) or 0 (if the condition `count == j` was never met). The variable `k` will be equal to `n - j - 1`, as it increments with each iteration of the loop. The variable `n` remains greater than `j`, and the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` in string `s` continue to meet the specified conditions throughout the loop's execution. If `count` equals `j` at any point, the function prints `count * 2` and returns, thus terminating the loop prematurely.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a string `s` and an integer `t` internally, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each testcase, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The total length of all strings `s` over all testcases does not exceed 5000. Based on certain conditions, the function may return 0, 1, or None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns count which is 2 if either the (k+1)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+1+j)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+1)-th character of `s` is equal to the (k+1+j)-th character of `s`; otherwise, count is 1.

Case_3: The program returns 0

Case_4: The program returns 0

Case_5: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.

Case_6: The program returns 0

Case_7: The program returns None

Case_8: The program returns None

Case_9: The program returns None

Case_10: The program returns 0


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
