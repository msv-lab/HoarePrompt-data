Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables used in the loop, which are `k` and the range `0, n - j`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `k`**: The loop starts with `k` being 0, as specified by the range `range(0, n - j)`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `k < n - j`. Therefore, the initial value of `k` (which is 0) satisfies this condition, and the loop will execute at least once unless `n - j` is 0 or negative.

4. **Check the Values of `n` and `j`**: Given that `j` is defined as `n // 2 - 1`, we need to ensure that `n - j > 0` for the loop to execute. This means `n - (n // 2 - 1) > 0`, which simplifies to `n - n // 2 + 1 > 0` or `n // 2 + 1 > 0`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n // 2 + 1` will always be positive, ensuring the loop can execute.

5. **Adjust the States**: The only variables that need adjustment are `k`, `n`, and `j`. The initial value of `k` is 0, and the values of `n` and `j` are derived from the given conditions.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `k` should be 0.
- `n` should be greater than 1.
- `j` should be `n // 2 - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2 - 1**
