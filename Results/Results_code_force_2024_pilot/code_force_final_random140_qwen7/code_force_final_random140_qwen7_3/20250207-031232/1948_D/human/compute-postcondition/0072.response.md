Output State: **`count` is 0, `k` is 0, `n` is greater than `j`, and the condition `(s[k] != '?' and s[k + j] != '?' and s[k] != s[k + j])` holds true**

Explanation: The line `count = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `count`. This does not affect the values of `k`, `n`, `j`, or the condition involving the string `s`. Therefore, these variables and the condition remain unchanged from their initial states.
