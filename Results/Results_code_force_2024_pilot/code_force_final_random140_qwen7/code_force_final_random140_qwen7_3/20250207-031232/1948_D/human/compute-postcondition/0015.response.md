Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), `count` is 1 if either the k-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+j)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the k-th character of `s` is equal to the (k+j)-th character of `s`; otherwise, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is 0, and `count` is not equal to `j`.
