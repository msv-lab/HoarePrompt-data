Output State: **`count` is 0, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than `j`, the character at index `k` in string `s` is not '?', the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is not '?', and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`**

Explanation: The line `count = 0` sets the value of `count` to 0. All other variables (`k`, `n`, `j`, and the characters in string `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
