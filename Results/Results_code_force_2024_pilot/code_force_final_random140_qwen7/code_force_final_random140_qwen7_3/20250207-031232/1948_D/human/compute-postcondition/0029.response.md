Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\).
- `count` is 3 if either the (k+2)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+2+j)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+2)-th character of `s` is equal to the (k+2+j)-th character of `s`; otherwise, `count` is 0.

The print statement is `print(count * 2)`. 

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the value of `count`:

- If any of the following conditions are true:
  - The (k+2)-th character of `s` is a question mark.
  - The (k+2+j)-th character of `s` is a question mark.
  - The (k+2)-th character of `s` is equal to the (k+2+j)-th character of `s`.

Then `count` is set to 3. In this case, `count * 2` would be \(3 * 2 = 6\).

- Otherwise, `count` is 0. In this case, `count * 2` would be \(0 * 2 = 0\).

Since the exact value of `k` and `j` is not specified, and the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `count`. However, based on the conditions provided, `count` can only be 0 or 3.

Therefore, the output will be either 0 or 6 depending on the conditions specified for `count`.

Output: **0 or 6**
