Postcondition: **`count` is either 2 or 0, `k` is 1, `n` is greater than `j`, the character at index `k` in string `s` is not '?', the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is not '?', and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`. If `count` equals `j`, the function returns None.**
