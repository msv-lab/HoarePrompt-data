Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), `count` is 3 if for any `k` in the range \(0\) to \(n-j-1\), the conditions `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]` hold true for three consecutive iterations; otherwise, `count` is less than 3 and the program returns 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is updated accordingly.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `count` will be 6 if there are three consecutive matches (either characters being equal or one of them being a question mark) within the specified range of the string `s` for `j` steps ahead, otherwise, `count` will be less than 3 and the program will return 0. The value of `n` will still be greater than 1, and `j` will be updated based on the loop's execution.
