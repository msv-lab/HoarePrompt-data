Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a string `s` and an integer `t` internally, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each testcase, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The total length of all strings `s` over all testcases does not exceed 5000. Based on certain conditions, the function may return 0, 1, or None.**

This functionality describes a function that internally handles a string `s` and an integer `t`, and depending on specific conditions, returns either 0, 1, or None. However, the function itself does not accept any parameters directly.
