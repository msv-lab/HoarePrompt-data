Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000.
   - `count` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `k` is `j + 1` if `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]` or either `s[k]` or `s[k + j]` is a question mark. Otherwise, `count` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(count * 2)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `count` is explicitly given as 1.
- Therefore, `count * 2` is `1 * 2 = 2`.

So, the print statement will output `2`.

Output: **2**
