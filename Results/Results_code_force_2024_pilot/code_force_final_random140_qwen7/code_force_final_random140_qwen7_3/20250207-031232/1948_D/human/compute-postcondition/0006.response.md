Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), `count` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 0, and for all valid indices `k` and `j`, `s[k]` is not a question mark, `s[k + j]` is not a question mark, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
