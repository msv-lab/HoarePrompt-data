Based on the initial state provided, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that each is within the range `[0, n-1]`, where `n` is a positive integer between `2` and `10^4`. The `print` statement outputs a formatted string with these four variables.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, they will be represented as their respective variable names in the output string.

Output: **? a b c d**
