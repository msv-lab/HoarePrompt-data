Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\), all less than \(n\), where \(n\) is a positive integer between 2 and 10,000. It prints these parameters and then waits for the user to provide an input, which it subsequently returns.**
