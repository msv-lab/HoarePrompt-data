Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the interaction with the jury and does not guarantee finding the maximum XOR pair within the allowed number of queries.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The program uses `func_1` to simulate the jury's response but does not handle the responses correctly. The function `func_1` is supposed to compare `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)` and return `<`, `>`, or `=`. However, the program does not store or use these results effectively.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The program attempts to find the maximum XOR pair by comparing elements in a suboptimal manner. It initializes `ans1` to 0 and iterates through the array, but it does not correctly update the indices to maximize the XOR value. The logic for finding the maximum XOR pair is flawed and does not ensure that the maximum XOR is found within the allowed 3n queries.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the indices `v` without ensuring that the maximum XOR pair is found. Instead of printing the indices `i` and `j` that maximize the XOR, it prints the entire list `v`, which is not the correct output format.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and cannot be considered correct. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
