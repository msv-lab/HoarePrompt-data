### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates through the values from 1 to \(n-1\) to find a candidate index `ans1` that might maximize the bitwise OR with `ans1`.
   - It then finds a set of indices (`v`) that have the same maximum bitwise OR value with `ans1`.
   - From this set, it selects the index `ans` that maximizes the bitwise XOR with `ans1`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program uses `func_1` to perform the comparison queries.
   - The logic for finding `ans1` seems flawed because it compares `ans1` with itself, which doesn't provide useful information.
   - The logic for finding `v` is also problematic because it only considers indices greater than `mx` and doesn't ensure that the maximum bitwise OR is being tracked correctly.
   - The final selection of `ans` from `v` is also flawed because it only checks against `ans1`, which might not be the optimal choice.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR.
   - The logic for finding `ans1` and `v` is incorrect and does not guarantee that the final answer is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
