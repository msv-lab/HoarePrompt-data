Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over each character `q` in the string `e`. Therefore, the loop head involves the variable `q`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `e`. After the previous iteration, `q` is the current character being processed.

3. **Update the state based on the conditions**:
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - `P` is 2.
   - `M` is `M + 1`.
   - If the next character `q` in `e` is '+', then `P` remains 2.
   - If `q` is not '+', `M` is incremented by 1.

Since we don't know the exact value of `q` from the previous iteration, we need to consider both possible scenarios for the next iteration:

- If `q` is '+', `P` remains 2.
- If `q` is not '+', `M` is incremented by 1.

However, since we are adjusting the state for the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the general case where `q` could be any character in `e` except the last one (since it has already been processed).

Given that `e` is a non-empty string, `q` will be the first character of `e` if it hasn't been fully iterated through yet.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `q` is the next character in `e`, and the values of `P` and `M` are updated based on the condition described.

**State:**
- `e` is a non-empty string.
- `P` is 2.
- `M` is `M + 1`.

Since `q` is the next character in `e`, we need to ensure that `q` is set to the next character in the string `e`.

**Final State:**
State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `P` is 2, `M` is `M + 1`, `q` is the next character in `e`**
