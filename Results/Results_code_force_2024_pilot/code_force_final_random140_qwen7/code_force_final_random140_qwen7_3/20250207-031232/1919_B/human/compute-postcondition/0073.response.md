Based on the initial state provided, `P` is the count of '+' characters in the string `e`, and `M` is the count of '-' or any other character that is not '+' in the string `e`. The expression `abs(P - M)` calculates the absolute difference between these two counts.

Let's break it down:

1. **Counting `P`:** For every character `q` in the string `e`, if `q` is '+', `P` is incremented by 1.
2. **Counting `M`:** For every character `q` in the string `e`, if `q` is not '+', `M` is incremented by 1.

The `abs(P - M)` expression then computes the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non '+' characters in the string `e`.

Given this, the print statement will output the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and non '+' characters in the string `e`.

Output: **abs(P - M) (where P is the count of '+' characters and M is the count of '-' or any other character that is not '+' in the string e)**
