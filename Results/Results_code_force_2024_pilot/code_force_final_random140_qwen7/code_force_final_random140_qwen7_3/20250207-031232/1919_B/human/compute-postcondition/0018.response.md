Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `q` which iterates over each character in the string `e`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `e`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - `q` is the next character in the string `e`.
   - If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `M` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `q` is the next character in `e`, after processing `q`, `q` will now be the next character in `e`.
   - The string `e` will have one less character than it had before the iteration.
   - If `q` was '+', `P` remains 1. Otherwise, `M` is increased by 1.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `e` must be a string with one less character than it had before (since `q` is now the next character).
   - `q` will be the next character in the updated string `e`.
   - `P` remains 1 if `q` was '+'.
   - `M` is increased by 1 if `q` was not '+'.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`e` is a non-empty string with one less character, `q` is the next character in the string `e`, `P` is 1 if the previous `q` was '+', otherwise `M` is increased by 1**.
