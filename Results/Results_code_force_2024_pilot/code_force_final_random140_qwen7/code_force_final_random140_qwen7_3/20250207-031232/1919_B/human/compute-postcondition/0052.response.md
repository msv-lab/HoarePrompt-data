Output State: **`i` is `len(e) + 1`, `s` is an input integer, `P` is 0, `M` is the total count of characters in `e` that are not '+', `e` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The line `P = 0` initializes the variable `P` to 0. All other variables (`i`, `s`, `M`, and `e`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
