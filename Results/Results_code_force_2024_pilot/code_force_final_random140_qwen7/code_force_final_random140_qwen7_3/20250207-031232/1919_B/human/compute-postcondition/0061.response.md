Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for q in e:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `q` and `e`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**: 
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1.
   - If `q` is not '+', then `M` is 1.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `q` is iterating through each character of `e`, at the end of the previous iteration, `q` would have taken on the value of the current character being processed, and `e` would still be the same string as it was before the loop started (since `e` is not modified within the loop).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `e` remains the same non-empty string.
   - For the loop to continue, `q` needs to take on the next character in the string `e`.

5. **Postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - If the next character `q` is '+', then `P` will be 1.
   - If the next character `q` is not '+', then `M` will be 1.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`e` is a non-empty string, if `q` is the next character in `e` and it is '+', then `P` is 1. If `q` is the next character in `e` and it is not '+', then `M` is 1.**
