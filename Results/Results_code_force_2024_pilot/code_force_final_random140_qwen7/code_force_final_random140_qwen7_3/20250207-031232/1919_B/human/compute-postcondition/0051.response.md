Output State: **`i` is `len(e) + 1`, `s` is an input integer, `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the string `e`, `M` is the total count of characters in `e` that are not '+', `e` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The code `e = input()` takes a new input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `e`. The values of `i`, `s`, `P`, and `M` remain unchanged from their initial states.
