Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of the string `e`, `s` is an input integer, `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the string `e`, `M` is the total count of characters in `e` that are not '+'.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `P` will hold the total count of '+' characters in the string `e`, and the variable `M` will hold the total count of characters in `e` that are not '+'. The other variables (`i` and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states, with `i` being the length of the string `e` and `s` being the integer input provided initially.
