Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of the string `e`, `s` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `M` is 1, `P` is 0, and the character `q` is not '+'**.

The code `M += 1` increments the value of `M` by 1. Given that `M` was initially 0, it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
