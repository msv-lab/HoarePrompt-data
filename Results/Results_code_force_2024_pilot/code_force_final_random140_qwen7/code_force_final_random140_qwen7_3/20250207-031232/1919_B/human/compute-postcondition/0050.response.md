Output State: **`i` is `len(e) + 1`, `s` is an input integer, `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the string `e`, `M` is the total count of characters in `e` that are not '+', `s` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `s = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `s`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `P`, `M`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
