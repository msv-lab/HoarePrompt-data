Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `P` is 2, `M` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `P` is incremented by 1. Since the initial condition was that if the next character in `e` is '+', then `P` is 1, and if it is not '+', then `M` is 1, the increment of `P` means that the next character in `e` is now considered to be '+', making `P` equal to 2. The value of `M` remains 1 because no change was made to it in the given code snippet.
