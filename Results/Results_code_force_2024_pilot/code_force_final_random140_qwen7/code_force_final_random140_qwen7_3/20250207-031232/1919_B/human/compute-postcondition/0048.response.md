Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to the length of the string `e`.
   - `s` is an input integer.
   - `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
   - `M` is the total count of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(abs(P - M))
   ```

3. **Understanding Variables:**
   - `i = len(e)`: This means `i` is the total number of characters in the string `e`.
   - `P`: This is the count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
   - `M`: This is the count of characters in `e` that are not '+'. Since `i` is the total length of `e`, and `P` is the count of '+', then `M = i - P`.

4. **Expression Inside `abs`:**
   - The expression inside `abs` is `P - M`.
   - Substituting `M` with `i - P`, we get `P - (i - P) = P - i + P = 2P - i`.

5. **Absolute Value:**
   - The `abs` function will take the absolute value of `2P - i`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the absolute value of `2P - i`.

Given this reasoning, the output will be the absolute value of `2P - i`.

Output: **abs(2P - i)**
