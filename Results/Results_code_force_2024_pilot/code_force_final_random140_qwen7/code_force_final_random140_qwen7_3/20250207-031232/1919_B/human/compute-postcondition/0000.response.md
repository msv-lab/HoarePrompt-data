Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer.
   - Given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the input will always return a valid value within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` is a positive integer, the input will always be a valid number within the specified range, ensuring the loop can execute.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.

4. **Final state adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start by setting `i` to 0.
   - The value of `t` does not affect the loop's ability to start since it is guaranteed to be a valid input.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0**
