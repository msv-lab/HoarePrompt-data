Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `e` is a non-empty string.
- If `q` is equal to '+', then `P` is 1. Otherwise, `q` is not '+' and `M` is 1.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `q` and `e`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `e`.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `e`, at the start of the next iteration, `q` will be the next character in the string `e`.
   - The string `e` itself does not change within the loop; it remains the same throughout the iterations.

4. **Postconditions**:
   - If `q` was equal to '+', then `P` is 1. For the next iteration, `q` will be the next character in `e`.
   - If `q` was not '+', then `M` is 1. For the next iteration, `q` will be the next character in `e`.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `e` remains the same (a non-empty string).
- `q` becomes the next character in the string `e`.

### Final Answer
State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e`**
