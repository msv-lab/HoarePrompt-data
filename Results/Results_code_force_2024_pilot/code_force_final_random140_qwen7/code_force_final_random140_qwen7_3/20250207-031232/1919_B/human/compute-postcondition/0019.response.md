Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string with one less character, `q` is the next character in the string `e`, `P` is 2**.

Explanation: The initial state had `P` being 1 if the previous `q` was '+', otherwise `M` was increased by 1. After executing `P += 1`, the value of `P` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `P` was either 1 (if the previous `q` was '+') or `M` was increased by 1 (otherwise), after the increment, `P` becomes 2. The values of `e` and `q` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
