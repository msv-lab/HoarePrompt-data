Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to the length of the string `e`.
   - `s` is an input integer.
   - `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
   - `M` is the total count of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently equal to the length of the string `e`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The condition for the next iteration will be `i < int(input())`.

Given that `i` is equal to the length of the string `e` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be set to `len(e) + 1`.

However, since the exact value of `int(input())` is unknown, we cannot determine if `i` will still be less than `int(input())`. We only know that `i` will be `len(e) + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `len(e) + 1`, `s` is an input integer, `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the string `e`, `M` is the total count of characters in `e` that are not '+'**.
