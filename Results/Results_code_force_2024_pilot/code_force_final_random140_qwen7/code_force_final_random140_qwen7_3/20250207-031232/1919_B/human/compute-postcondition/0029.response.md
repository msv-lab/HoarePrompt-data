Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of the string `e`, `s` is assigned the value of int(input()), `e` is updated to the new input string, `P` is 0, `M` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `M = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `M`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `s`, `e`, or `P`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables as they were in the initial state, with `M` being explicitly set to 0.
