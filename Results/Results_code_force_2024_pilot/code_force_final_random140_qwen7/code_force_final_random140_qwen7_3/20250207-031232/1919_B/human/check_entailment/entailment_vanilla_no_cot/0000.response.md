Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e` and then takes the absolute value of this difference. This approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to consider all possible ways to split the array and choose the one that minimizes the total penalty. The current implementation only considers a single split and does not explore different possible splits to find the optimal solution.
