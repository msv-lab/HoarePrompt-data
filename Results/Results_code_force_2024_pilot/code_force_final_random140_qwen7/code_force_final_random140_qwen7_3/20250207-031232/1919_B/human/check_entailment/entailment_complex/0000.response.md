Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - It counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e` but does not handle the actual splitting of the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - The penalty calculation should consider the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the total penalty, which is not done in the provided code.
   - The current implementation only calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

Given these points, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
