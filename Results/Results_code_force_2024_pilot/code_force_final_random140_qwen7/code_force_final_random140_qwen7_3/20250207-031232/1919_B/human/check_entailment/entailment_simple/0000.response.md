Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads `s` as an integer, but according to the problem statement, `s` should be a string. This will lead to incorrect processing of the input.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty**: The program calculates the penalty as `abs(P - M)`, which is not the correct way to calculate the penalty as per the problem statement. The penalty is calculated based on the sum of elements in each subarray formed after splitting the array `a`.

Given these issues, the provided program does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
