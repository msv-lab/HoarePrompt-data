The function accepts a string `userString` of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. Based on the counts, it prints either 'A' or 'B' and returns nothing. If the string contains any characters other than 'A' and 'B', it prints nothing and returns nothing. The final state of the program ensures that `countA` and `countB` are both between 0 and 5, and their sum is always 5.
