Postcondition: `i` is `length_of_a + 2`, `t` is greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is an input string, `j` is the last character of `a`. If the count of characters in `a` that are not in 'A' (`l`) is less than the count of characters in 'A' (`h`), then the condition remains as is. Otherwise, the counts `l` and `h` retain their respective values.
