Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it receives a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B', where `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive, and all strings across all test cases are distinct. The function does not return a specific value but processes each string according to its content.**
