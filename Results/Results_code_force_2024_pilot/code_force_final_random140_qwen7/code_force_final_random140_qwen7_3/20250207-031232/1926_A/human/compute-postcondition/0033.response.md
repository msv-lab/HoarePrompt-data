Output State: **countA is between 0 and 5, countB is between 0 and 5, and their sum is 5.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all five iterations (since `userString` is a string of length 5), `countA` will be the total number of 'A's in `userString`, and `countB` will be the total number of 'B's in `userString`. Since `userString` consists only of 'A' and 'B', the sum of `countA` and `countB` will always be 5. The exact values of `countA` and `countB` depend on the specific characters in `userString`, but they will range from 0 to 5 each, with their sum always equal to 5.
