Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `a`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `length_of_a + 2`
   - `t` is greater than `length_of_a + 1`
   - `a` is an input string
   - `j` is the second character of `a`
   - If `j` is in 'A', then `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` is the second character of `a`, the loop will move to the next character in `a`.
   - Therefore, `j` will now be the third character of `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains the same string.
   - `j` changes to the third character of `a`.

5. **Postconditions for the next iteration**:
   - If the new `j` (the third character) is in 'A', then `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is `length_of_a + 2`, `t` is greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is an input string, `j` is the third character of `a`**.
