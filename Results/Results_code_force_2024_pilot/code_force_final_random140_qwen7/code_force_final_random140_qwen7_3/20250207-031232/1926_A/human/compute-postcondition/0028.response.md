Output State: **`countA` is either 3 or 0; `countB` is either 2 or 1; `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'**.

Explanation: The code `countB += 1` increments the value of `countB` by 1. Since `countB` was initially either 1 or 0, after the increment, it will be either 2 (if it was initially 1) or 1 (if it was initially 0). The values of `countA` and `userString` remain unchanged.
