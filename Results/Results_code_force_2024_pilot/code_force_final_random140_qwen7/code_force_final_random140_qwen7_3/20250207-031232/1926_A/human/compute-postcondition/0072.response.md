Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` (the current character being iterated over) and `a` (the input string).

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `i` is `length_of_a + 2`
   - `t` is greater than `length_of_a + 1`
   - `a` is an input string
   - `j` is the first character of `a`
   - If `j` is in 'A', then `l` is `i + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the first character of `a` at the start of the loop, after the first iteration, `j` will be the second character of `a`.
   - `a` remains the same as it is the input string.
   - `i` and `t` do not change within the loop body based on the given conditions.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `j` changes to the second character of `a`.
   - `i` remains `length_of_a + 2`.
   - `t` remains greater than `length_of_a + 1`.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `l` and `h` are not directly affected by the loop itself but depend on the value of `j`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `length_of_a + 2`, `t` is greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is an input string, `j` is the second character of `a`**.
