Output State: **`countA` is either 3 or 0, `countB` is either 1 or 0, `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
