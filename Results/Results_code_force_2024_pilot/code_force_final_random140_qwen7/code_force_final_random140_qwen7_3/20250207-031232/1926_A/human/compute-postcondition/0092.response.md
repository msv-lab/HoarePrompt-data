Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `length_of_a + 2`
- `t` is greater than `length_of_a + 1`
- `a` is an input string
- `j` is the last character of `a`
- The condition `l < h` is true, where `l` is the count of characters in `a` that are not in 'A', and `h` is the count of characters in `a` that are in 'A'.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('B')` will simply output the string 'B'.

Output: **B**
