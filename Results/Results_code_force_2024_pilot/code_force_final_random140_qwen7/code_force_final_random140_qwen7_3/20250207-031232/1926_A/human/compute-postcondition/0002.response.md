Output State: **`countA` is 0, `countB` is 0, `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'**

Explanation: The variable `countB` is initialized to 0, which does not affect the values of `countA` or `userString`. Therefore, `countA` remains 0, and `userString` remains a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
