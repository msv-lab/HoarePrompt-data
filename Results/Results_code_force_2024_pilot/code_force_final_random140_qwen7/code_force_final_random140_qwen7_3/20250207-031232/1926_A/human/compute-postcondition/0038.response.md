Given the initial state:
- `countA` is between 0 and 5.
- `countB` is between 0 and 5.
- The sum of `countA` and `countB` is 5.
- `countB` is greater than `countA`.

We need to determine the values of `countA` and `countB` that satisfy these conditions.

Let's analyze the possible values:
- Since `countB` is greater than `countA` and their sum is 5, the possible pairs \((countA, countB)\) are:
  - (0, 5)
  - (1, 4)
  - (2, 3)

Any other combination would either not satisfy the sum being 5 or `countB` not being greater than `countA`.

The `print('B')` statement simply prints the string 'B'. The values of `countA` and `countB` do not affect this print statement.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **B**
