Postcondition: `i` is `length_of_a + 1`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A' plus 1, `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A' plus 1, `t` must be greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the next character in `a`. If `j` is in 'A', `l` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1.
