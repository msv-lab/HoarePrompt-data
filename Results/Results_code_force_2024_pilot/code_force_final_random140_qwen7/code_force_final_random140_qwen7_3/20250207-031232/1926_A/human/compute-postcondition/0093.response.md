Postcondition: `i` is `length_of_a + 2`, `t` is greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is an input string, `j` is the last character of `a`. If any character `j` in `a` is not in 'A' and the count of such characters (`l`) is less than the count of characters in 'A' (`h`), then the condition `l < h` is true.
