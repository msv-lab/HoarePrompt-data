Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `a`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `length_of_a + 2`
   - `t` is greater than `length_of_a + 1`
   - `a` is an input string
   - `j` is the second character of `a`
   - If `j` is in 'A', then `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - The variable `j` is the second character of `a`, so in the next iteration, `j` will be the third character of `a`.
   - The variable `a` remains the same.
   - The postconditions for the loop to continue executing depend on the value of `j`:
     - If `j` is in 'A', `l` is increased by 1.
     - Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1.

Since the loop condition depends on the value of `j`, we need to consider both cases:
- If `j` is in 'A', then `l` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1.

However, since we are adjusting the state for the next iteration, we don't know the exact value of `j` yet. We just know it will be the next character in the string `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `j` is the next character in the string `a`, and the postconditions for `l` and `h` should be updated based on the possible values of `j`.

**State:**
- `i` is `length_of_a + 2`
- `t` is greater than `length_of_a + 1`
- `a` is an input string
- `j` is the third character of `a`
- If `j` is in 'A', then `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `length_of_a + 2`, `t` is greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is an input string, `j` is the third character of `a`, if `j` is in 'A', then `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1.**
