Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string. Specifically, the line `list(userString)` does not actually modify the string but creates a list from it, which is unnecessary and does not affect the count. The correct approach is to directly iterate over the string without converting it to a list. Here is the corrected version:

```python
userStrings = ['8', 'ABABB', 'ABABA', 'BBBAB', 'AAAAA', 'BBBBB', 'BABAA', 'AAAAB', 'BAAAA']
for userString in userStrings[1:]:  # Skip the first element which is the number of test cases
    func_1(userString)

def func_1(userString):
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
    if countA > countB:
        print('A')
    elif countB > countA:
        print('B')
    else:
        print('A')  # In case of tie, print 'A' as per the problem statement
```

This corrected program will correctly process each string and print the character that appears most frequently, handling ties by printing 'A'.
