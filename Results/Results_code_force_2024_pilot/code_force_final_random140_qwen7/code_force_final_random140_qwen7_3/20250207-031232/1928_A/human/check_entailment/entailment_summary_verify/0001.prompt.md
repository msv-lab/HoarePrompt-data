You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it takes two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) as input and prints 'YES' if neither \(a\) nor \(b\) are both odd and do not satisfy the specific divisibility conditions, otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final result for the last tested pair of \(a\) and \(b\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases.
   - It then processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Conditions for "NO"**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If they are, it prints 'NO'. This condition is correct because if both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle will always result in two rectangles with odd dimensions, and no combination of these smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle with even dimensions.
   - The program also checks if `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0`, or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO'. These conditions are meant to check specific cases where the original rectangle's dimensions are such that no new rectangle can be formed after cutting. However, these conditions are overly restrictive and do not cover all cases where a new rectangle cannot be formed.

3. **Conditions for "YES"**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'. This means the program assumes that if the previous conditions are not met, a new rectangle can always be formed. However, this assumption is incorrect because there are other scenarios where a new rectangle cannot be formed, such as when both dimensions are even but the resulting smaller rectangles cannot form a new unique rectangle.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: \(1 \times 1\)
  - Both dimensions are 1 (odd), so the program prints 'NO' correctly.

- **Test Case 2**: \(2 \times 1\)
  - One dimension is 2 (even), one is 1 (odd), so the program should print 'YES' because it can be cut into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles and reformed into a \(2 \times 1\) rectangle, but the program prints 'NO'.

- **Test Case 3**: \(2 \times 6\)
  - The program correctly prints 'YES' because it can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and reformed into a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.

- **Test Case 4**: \(3 \times 2\)
  - The program incorrectly prints 'NO' because it can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles and reformed into a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle.

- **Test Case 5**: \(2 \times 2\)
  - The program incorrectly prints 'NO' because it can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles and reformed into a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle.

- **Test Case 6**: \(2 \times 4\)
  - The program incorrectly prints 'NO' because it can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and reformed into a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle.

- **Test Case 7**: \(6 \times 3\)
  - The program correctly prints 'NO' because it cannot be cut in a way that allows forming a new unique rectangle.

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle all edge cases correctly and provides incorrect outputs for some test cases. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
