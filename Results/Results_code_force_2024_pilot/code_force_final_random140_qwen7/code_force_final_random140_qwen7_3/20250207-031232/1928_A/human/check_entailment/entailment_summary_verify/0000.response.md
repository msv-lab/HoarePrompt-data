### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The goal is to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle from a given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- The key points are:
  - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no new rectangle can be formed.
  - If \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, no new rectangle can be formed.
  - Other cases need to be checked for possible rearrangements.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, and if so, prints "NO".
- It also checks specific divisibility conditions:
  - If \(a / 2 == b\) and \(b\) is odd, or if \(b / 2 == a\) and \(a\) is odd, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function processes up to 10,000 test cases.
- It prints 'YES' if neither \(a\) nor \(b\) are both odd and do not satisfy the specific divisibility conditions.
- It prints 'NO' otherwise.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Case when both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd:**
   - The program correctly identifies this case and prints "NO".
   
2. **Case when either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1:**
   - The program does not explicitly check for this case. It only checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd or if the specific divisibility conditions are met.
   - According to the problem description, a \(1 \times 1\) rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, so it should print "NO".
   - The current implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to an incorrect output for the test case `1 1`.

3. **Other cases:**
   - The program checks for specific divisibility conditions, but it does not cover all possible valid rearrangements.
   - For example, a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, which is valid.
   - However, the program might miss some valid cases due to the specific conditions it checks.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, leading to incorrect outputs for such cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
