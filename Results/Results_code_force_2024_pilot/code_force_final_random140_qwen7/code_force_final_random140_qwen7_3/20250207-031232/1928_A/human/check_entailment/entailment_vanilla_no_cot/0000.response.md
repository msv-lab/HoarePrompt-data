Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` checks if both dimensions are odd. If both dimensions are odd, the resulting rectangles after cutting will also have odd dimensions, and thus, no new distinct rectangle can be formed. This part is correct.

2. **Special Case Handling**: The condition `elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0)` is incorrect. It incorrectly handles the special case where one dimension is exactly half the other and the other dimension is odd. This condition should not be checked separately; instead, the general logic should be handled.

3. **General Logic**: The general logic should be that if either dimension is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle by cutting the rectangle along the even dimension and rearranging the pieces. If both dimensions are odd, no new rectangle can be formed.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This version correctly checks if at least one dimension is even, which allows forming a new rectangle, and prints 'NO' otherwise.
