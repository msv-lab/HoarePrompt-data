Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is a non-negative integer
   - `a` is an integer from input
   - `b` is an integer from input
   - The condition for no changes is that both `a` and `b` are odd integers.
   - The condition for modifying `a` and `b` is `(a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0) or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0)`.
   - In all other cases, either `a` remains odd or `b` remains odd.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range of `n`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be a non-negative integer.

4. **Postconditions After the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body does not change the values of `a` and `b` directly; it only modifies them under specific conditions.
   - Therefore, the values of `a` and `b` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless the loop body modified them.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be a non-negative integer.
   - `a` and `b` retain their values from the end of the previous iteration unless the loop body modified them.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**.
