Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` indicating the number of sub-cases, followed by pairs of positive integers `a` and `b` for each sub-case. The function processes these inputs but does not explicitly take them as parameters within its definition.
