Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`. At this point, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `a` and `b` are integers from the last input provided within the loop. The final state of `a` and `b` will depend on the conditions checked in the loop:

- If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, the loop will print 'NO' for each iteration where this condition holds true.
- If the condition `(a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0) or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0)` is met for any iteration, the loop will print 'NO' and will not proceed further with the current pair of `a` and `b`.
- If none of the above conditions are met for any iteration, the loop will print 'YES' for the last valid pair of `a` and `b`.

Thus, the final output state is characterized by `i` being equal to `n`, and the values of `a` and `b` reflecting the last input pair processed by the loop, with the last printed statement being either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated throughout the loop's iterations.
