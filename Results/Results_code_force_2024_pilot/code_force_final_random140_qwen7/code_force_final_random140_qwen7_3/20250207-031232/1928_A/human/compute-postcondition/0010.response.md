Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input. If the condition `(a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0) or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0)` is true, then either `a` is even or `b` is even, and the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, either `a` is odd or `b` is odd.
