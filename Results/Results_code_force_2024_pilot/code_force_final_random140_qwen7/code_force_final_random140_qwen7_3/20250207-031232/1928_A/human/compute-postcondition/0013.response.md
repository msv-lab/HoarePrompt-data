Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, then no changes are made. Otherwise, if the condition `(a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0) or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0)` is true, then either `a` is even and `b` is odd, or `b` is even and `a` is odd. In all other cases, either `a` remains odd or `b` remains odd.
