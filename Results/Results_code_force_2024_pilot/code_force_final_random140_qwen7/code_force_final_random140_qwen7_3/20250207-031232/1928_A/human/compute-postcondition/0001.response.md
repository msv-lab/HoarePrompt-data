Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(n):` to execute, the variable `n` must be a non-negative integer because `range(n)` generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Adjust the Given States**:
   - The initial value of `t` (which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)) does not affect the loop's execution conditions directly.
   - The initial value of `n` must be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

Therefore, the state should be modified as follows:
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` must be a non-negative integer.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a non-negative integer**
