Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is set to 0 initially. The value of `n` is not directly used or changed in the given code, but it is mentioned to be a non-negative integer in the initial state, which remains unchanged. Therefore, `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split operation.
