Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it takes two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) as input and prints 'YES' if neither \(a\) nor \(b\) are both odd and do not satisfy the specific divisibility conditions, otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final result for the last tested pair of \(a\) and \(b\).**
