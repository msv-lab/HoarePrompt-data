Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, the input was split and assigned to `a` and `b` respectively. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` is met. Otherwise, the condition is met if either `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0`, or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`.
