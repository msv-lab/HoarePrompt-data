Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `i` is 2.
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, but its specific value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `a` and `b` are integers from input.
- The condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` must be met, meaning both `a` and `b` are odd.
- The other conditions (`a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0`, or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`) do not need to be checked because the first condition already ensures that both `a` and `b` are odd.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b` as long as they meet the specified condition. Therefore, the output is **NO**.
