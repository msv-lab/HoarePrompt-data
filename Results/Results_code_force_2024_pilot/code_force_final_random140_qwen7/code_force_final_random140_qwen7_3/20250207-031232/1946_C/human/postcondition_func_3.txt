The function `func_4` accepts a `Tree` object `tree`, an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and an integer `k` representing the number of edges to remove. It performs a binary search-like algorithm to find a value `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree, ensuring that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`. The function returns the value of `beg` (or equivalently `end`) when the loop terminates, which indicates the smallest possible value of `x` that satisfies the condition.
