tree is a Tree object representing a tree with n vertices, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and the method func_3(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int, x: int) returns a boolean indicating whether it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.
