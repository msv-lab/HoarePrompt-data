### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

#### Function Summaries Recap
- `func_1`: Uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) where it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges and ensure each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
- `dfs`: Performs a depth-first search to count the number of nodes in each connected component starting from a given node with a minimum size requirement.
- `check`: Determines if it is possible to have at least \( k \) connected components, each with at least \( x \) nodes.

#### Analysis of the Code

1. **Graph Construction (`func_1`)**:
   - The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using the given edges.
   - This part is correct and necessary for further processing.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The binary search is initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // (k + 1)`.
   - The upper bound `r = n // (k + 1)` is correct because we need to ensure that at least one component remains after removing \( k \) edges.
   - The binary search aims to find the maximum value \( mid \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges and ensure each remaining connected component has at least \( mid \) vertices.

3. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is designed to perform a depth-first search and count the number of nodes in each connected component starting from a given node `x` with a minimum size requirement `y`.
   - The function correctly counts the number of nodes in each component and returns the total count of such components and the total number of nodes in those components.

4. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function uses the `dfs` function to determine if it is possible to have at least \( k \) components, each with at least \( x \) nodes.
   - The function correctly clears the `visited` set before starting the DFS from node `1`.

#### Correctness of the Code

- The binary search range is correctly set to `n // (k + 1)`.
- The `dfs` function correctly counts the number of valid components and their sizes.
- The `check` function correctly verifies if it is possible to have at least \( k \) components, each with at least \( x \) nodes.

Given the corrections and the analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

**Final: True**

The given program is correct.
