The function reads the number of vertices `n` and an integer `k` from the user, constructs a tree with `n` vertices based on user-specified edges, roots the tree at vertex 0 using a non-recursive approach, and then calls another function `func_4` with the rooted tree, the number of vertices `n`, and the integer `k` as arguments. The result of `func_4` is printed as the output.
