Output State: **`stack` is updated such that the last element (a tuple containing `v` and `postorder`) is removed; `v` is the first element of the removed tuple; `postorder` is the second element of the removed tuple, and `postorder` is not an empty value, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element; `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]` and now equals `good_components[u] + 1`; `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`.**

In this output state, the `good_components[v]` variable has been incremented by `good_components[u]`, resulting in `good_components[v]` being equal to `good_components[u] + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
