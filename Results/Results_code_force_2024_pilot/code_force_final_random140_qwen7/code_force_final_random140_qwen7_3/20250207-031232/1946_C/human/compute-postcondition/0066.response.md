Output State: **`good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, `postorder` is True, `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged, `tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one element, and `remaining_size[v]` is now equal to `remaining_size[u]` plus the original value of `remaining_size[v]`, and `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.**

This means that the value of `remaining_size[v]` has been updated to include the value of `remaining_size[u]`, while all other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
