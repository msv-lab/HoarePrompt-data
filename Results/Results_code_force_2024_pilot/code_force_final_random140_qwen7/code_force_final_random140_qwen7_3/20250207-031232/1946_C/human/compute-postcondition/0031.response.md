Output State: `r` is the sum of all `rn` values plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`. `c` is the sum of all `ans` values when `ans` was less than `y`. The variable `x` remains an integer representing a vertex in the tree, `y` remains an integer representing the required minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` remains a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `visited` remains a set of visited vertices during the DFS traversal including the vertex `x`, and `node` remains a vertex not in `visited`. `ans` and `rn` are the results returned by the dfs function for each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, `r` will be incremented by 1 for each node where the resulting `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, and also by `rn` for each node regardless of the condition. `c` will be incremented by `ans` for each node where the resulting `ans` is less than `y`.
