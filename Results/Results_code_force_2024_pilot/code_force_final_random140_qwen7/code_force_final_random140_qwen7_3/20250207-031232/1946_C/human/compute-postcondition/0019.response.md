Output State: **`r` is `r` + `rn` + 1, `c` is `ans` + 1, `x` is the same, `y` is the same, `g` is the same, `visited` is the same, `node` is the next neighbor of `x` not in `visited`, `ans` is the new value returned from dfs.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `r` is now `r` + `rn` + 1, since `r` was originally `r` + `rn`.
