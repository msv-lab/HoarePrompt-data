Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer. It also uses a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes and a function `dfs` for depth-first search. The function returns `True` if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that each remaining connected component has at least x vertices; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
