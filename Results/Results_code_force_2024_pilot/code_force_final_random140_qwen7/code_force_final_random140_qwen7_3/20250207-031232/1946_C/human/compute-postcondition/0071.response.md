Output State: **`good_components[v]' is updated to its previous value plus 1**.

Explanation: The code `good_components[v] += 1` increments the value of `good_components[v]` by 1. Since the initial state only mentions that `good_components[v]' is updated to its previous value plus the value of `good_components[u]'`, and now it is specifically updated to its previous value plus 1, we conclude that `good_components[v]' is updated to its previous value plus 1. The value of `good_components[u]' remains unchanged.
