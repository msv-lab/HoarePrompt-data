Postcondition: `good_components[v]'` is updated to its original value plus 1 if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `good_components[v]'` is updated to its original value plus `good_components[u]'`, and `remaining_size[v]'` is now equal to the original value of `remaining_size[v]'` plus the value of `remaining_size[u]'`. `u` is the next child vertex of `v`.
