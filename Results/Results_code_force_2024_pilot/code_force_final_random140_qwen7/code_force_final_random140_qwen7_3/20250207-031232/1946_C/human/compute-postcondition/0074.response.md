Postcondition: `good_components[v]' is updated to its previous value plus 1 if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `good_components[v]'` is updated to its previous value plus the value of `good_components[u]'`, and `remaining_size[v]'` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]'`.
