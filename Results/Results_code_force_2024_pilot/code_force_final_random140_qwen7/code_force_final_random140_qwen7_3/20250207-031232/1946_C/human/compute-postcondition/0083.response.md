Postcondition: **`v` is the value popped from `stack`, `postorder` is True, and the dictionaries `good_components` and `remaining_size` are updated according to the following rules: if `postorder` is False, the stack will contain all the children of `tree.vertices[v]` paired with `False`; otherwise, for each child `u` of `v`, if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `good_components[v]` is incremented by `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is updated to the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v`.**
