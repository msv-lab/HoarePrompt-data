You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges.
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    good_components = {}
    remaining_size = {}
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            good_components[v] = 0
            remaining_size[v] = 1
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        elif postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                good_components[v] += good_components[u]
                if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                    good_components[v] += 1
                else:
                    remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]
        
    #State: Output State: `stack` is empty, `tree` is still an instance of the Tree class, `s` is the starting vertex, `x` is the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `good_components` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the value is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of the key vertex where `remaining_size[u] >= x`, plus 1 for each child `u` where `remaining_size[u] < x`. `remaining_size` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the value is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of the key vertex.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `stack` is empty because all vertices have been processed. The `tree` object remains unchanged. The `good_components` dictionary contains the total count of "good" components (components with size >= `x`) for each vertex, considering its children. Similarly, the `remaining_size` dictionary holds the total size of remaining components for each vertex, again considering its children.
    return good_components[s], remaining_size[s]
    #The program returns two values: `good_components[s]`, which is the total count of "good" components for the starting vertex `s`, considering its children, and `remaining_size[s]`, which is the total size of remaining components for the starting vertex `s`, considering its children.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `tree`, which is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices and edges; `s`, which is an integer representing the starting vertex; and `x`, which is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The function returns two values: `good_components[s]`, which is the total count of "good" components for the starting vertex `s`, considering its children, and `remaining_size[s]`, which is the total size of remaining components for the starting vertex `s`, considering its children.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns two values: `good_components[s]`, which is the total count of "good" components for the starting vertex `s`, considering its children, and `remaining_size[s]`, which is the total size of remaining components for the starting vertex `s`, considering its children.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
