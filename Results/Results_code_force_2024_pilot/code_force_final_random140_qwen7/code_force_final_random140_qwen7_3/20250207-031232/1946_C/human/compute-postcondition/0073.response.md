Postcondition: `good_components[v]' is updated to its previous value plus either 1 (if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`), or plus the value of `good_components[u]'` and `remaining_size[v]'` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]'` (if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`).
