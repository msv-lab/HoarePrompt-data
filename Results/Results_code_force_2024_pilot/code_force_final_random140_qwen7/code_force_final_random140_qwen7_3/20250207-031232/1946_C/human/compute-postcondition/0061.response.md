Output State: **`good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, `postorder` is True, `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged, `tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `good_components[v]` by adding the value of `good_components[u]` to it. The other variables (`postorder`, `good_components`, `remaining_size`, and the condition on `tree.vertices[v].children`) remain unchanged.
