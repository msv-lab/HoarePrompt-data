Output State: **All vertices in `tree.vertices[s]` have been processed through the loop. `good_components[s]` contains the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `s` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`, plus 1 for each child `u` where `remaining_size[u] < x`. `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `s`.**

This means that after the loop has executed for all iterations, `good_components[s]` will hold the total count of "good components" for the starting vertex `s`, considering the conditions given. Similarly, `remaining_size[s]` will reflect the accumulated size of the remaining components after processing all children of `s`.
