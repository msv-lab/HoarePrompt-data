Output State: The stack will contain a list of all children of `tree.vertices[v]` with their second state set to `False`. Specifically, if `tree.vertices[v].children` has `n` elements, then `stack` will contain `(u_1, False), (u_2, False), ..., (u_n, False)`, where `u_1, u_2, ..., u_n` are all the children of `tree.vertices[v]`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the stack will contain tuples for each child of the vertex `v` in the tree, with the second element of each tuple being `False`. This means that each child of `v` has been pushed onto the stack exactly once, and the second element indicates that none of these children have yet been processed further in the context of this loop.
