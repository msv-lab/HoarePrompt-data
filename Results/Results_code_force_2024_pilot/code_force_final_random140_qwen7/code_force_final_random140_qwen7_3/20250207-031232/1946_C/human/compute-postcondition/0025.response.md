Output State: **`ans` is the result of the dfs function call with arguments `node` and `y`; `rn` is the second return value of the dfs function call with arguments `node` and `y`.**

This means that the `dfs` function was called with `node` and `y` as arguments, and it returned two values: `ans` and `rn`. The values of `ans` and `rn` depend on the implementation of the `dfs` function and the inputs `node` and `y`. The initial values of other variables remain unchanged.
