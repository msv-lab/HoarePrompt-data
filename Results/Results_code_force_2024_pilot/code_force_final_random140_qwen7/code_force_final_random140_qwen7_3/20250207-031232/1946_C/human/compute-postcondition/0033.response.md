Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: `c`, which is the sum of all `ans` values when `ans` was less than `y`, and `r`, which is the sum of all `rn` values plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.**

This means that after the loop and the DFS traversal, the program calculates and returns the final values of `c` and `r` based on the conditions described.
