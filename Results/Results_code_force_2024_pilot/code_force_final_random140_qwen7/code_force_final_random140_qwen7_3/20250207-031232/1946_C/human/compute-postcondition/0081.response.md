Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `good_components[v]` will be updated based on the cumulative contributions from all children of vertex `v` in the tree. Specifically, for each child `u` of `v`, if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` will be incremented by 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` will be incremented by `good_components[u]`. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]` will be updated to include the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v`. The variable `postorder` remains True, and the dictionaries `good_components` and `remaining_size` are updated according to the loop's logic for all children of `v`.**

This means that `good_components[v]` will reflect the total count of components that meet the criteria (based on `remaining_size[u]` relative to `x`) across all descendants of `v`, and `remaining_size[v]` will represent the aggregated size of all descendants' `remaining_size` values.
