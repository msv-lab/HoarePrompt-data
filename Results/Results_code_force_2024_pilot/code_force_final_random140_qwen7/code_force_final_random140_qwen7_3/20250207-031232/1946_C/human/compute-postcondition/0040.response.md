Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in a tree). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree, performs a binary search to find a specific value, and prints the result of the binary search. The function does not return any value but prints the outcome of the binary search.**
