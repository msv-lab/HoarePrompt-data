Output State: **`r` is `r` + `rn`, `c` is `ans` + 1, `x` is the same, `y` is the same, `g` is the same, `visited` is the same, `node` is the next neighbor of `x` not in `visited`, `ans` is the new value returned from dfs.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated by adding `rn` to its current value. The other variables (`c`, `x`, `y`, `g`, `visited`, `node`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
