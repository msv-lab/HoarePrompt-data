Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is 0, `c` is 1, `x` is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, `y` is an integer representing the required minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, and `visited` is a set of visited vertices during the DFS traversal; `visited` now includes the vertex `x`.
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node not in visited:
        ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
        r += rn
        if ans >= y:
            r += 1
        else:
            c += ans


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `r` is 0 + `rn` + 1 if `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, otherwise `r` is 0 + `rn` and `c` is `ans` + 1. `x` is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, `y` is an integer representing the required minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `visited` is a set of visited vertices during the DFS traversal including the vertex `x`, and `node` is a vertex not in `visited`. `ans` and `rn` are the results returned by the dfs function.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `r` is either `r + rn + 1` if `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, or `r + rn` if `ans` is less than `y`. `c` is `ans + 1` in both cases. `x`, `y`, `g`, `visited`, and `node` remain the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `node` is a node, `r` is updated based on the value of `ans` from the DFS call. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, then `r` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by `ans`, and `r` is incremented by `rn`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
