Postcondition: **`v` is the value popped from `stack`, `postorder` is True, and the dictionaries `good_components` and `remaining_size` are updated as follows: for each child `u` of `v`, if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is incremented by `good_components[u]`. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to include the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v`.**
