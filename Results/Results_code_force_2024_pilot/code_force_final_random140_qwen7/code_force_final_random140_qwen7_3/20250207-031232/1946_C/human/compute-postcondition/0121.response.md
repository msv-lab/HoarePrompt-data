Postcondition: **`v` is an integer, `postorder` is a non-empty value, `good_components[v]` is updated to its original value plus the sum of 1 if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x` for any `u`, or `good_components[u]` if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x` for any `u`. `remaining_size[v]` is updated to the sum of its original value and the values of `remaining_size[u]` for all `u` that are children of `v`.**
