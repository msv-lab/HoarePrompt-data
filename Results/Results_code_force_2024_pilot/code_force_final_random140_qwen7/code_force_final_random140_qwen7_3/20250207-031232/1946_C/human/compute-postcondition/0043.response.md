Postcondition: **`stack` contains tuples for all vertices in the subtree starting from `v`, with each tuple indicating a vertex that has not yet been processed (`False`). The `postorder` flag remains `False`, and the dictionaries `good_components` and `remaining_size` are updated based on whether the `postorder` flag is `True` or `False`. If `postorder` is `True`, `good_components[s]` contains the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `s` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`, plus 1 for each child `u` where `remaining_size[u] < x`. `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `s`. If `postorder` is `False`, no changes are made to `good_components` and `remaining_size`.**
