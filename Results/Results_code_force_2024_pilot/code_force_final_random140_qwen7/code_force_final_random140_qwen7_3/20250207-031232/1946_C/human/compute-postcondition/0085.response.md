Output State: **`stack` is updated such that the last element (a tuple containing `v` and `postorder`) is removed; `v` is the first element of the removed tuple; `postorder` is the second element of the removed tuple.**

This means that the `stack` variable has been modified by removing its last element, which was a tuple containing `v` and `postorder`. The values of `v` and `postorder` are now available as separate variables, with `v` being the first element and `postorder` being the second element of the removed tuple.
