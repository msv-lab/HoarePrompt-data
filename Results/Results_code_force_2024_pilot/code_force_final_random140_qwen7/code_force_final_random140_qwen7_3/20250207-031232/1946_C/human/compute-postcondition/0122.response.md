Postcondition: **`stack` will contain a list of tuples where each tuple consists of a vertex `u` from `tree.vertices[v].children` and the boolean value `False`, ensuring that every child is accounted for exactly once. If `postorder` is empty, `v`, `good_components[v]`, and `remaining_size[v]` remain in their final state as specified in the initial conditions. If `postorder` is non-empty, `v` remains unchanged, `good_components[v]` is updated to its original value plus the sum of 1 if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x` for any `u`, or `good_components[u]` if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x` for any `u`. `remaining_size[v]` is updated to the sum of its original value and the values of `remaining_size[u]` for all `u` that are children of `v`.**
