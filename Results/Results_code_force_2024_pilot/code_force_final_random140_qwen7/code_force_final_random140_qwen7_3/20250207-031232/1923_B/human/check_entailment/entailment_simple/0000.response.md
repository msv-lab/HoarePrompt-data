### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `n` and `k` are read and parsed as integers.
   - Lists `a` and `b` are initialized.
   - For each monster, the distance `x` is read and the corresponding health `a[i]` is added to `b[abs(x)]`.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - The list `b` is constructed such that `b[j]` represents the total health of monsters at distance `j` from the player.

3. **Survival Check**:
   - A loop runs from `1` to `n`:
     - `r` is incremented by `k` each iteration.
     - If `r` becomes less than `b[i]` at any point, it means the player cannot survive, and "NO" is printed.
     - Otherwise, `r` is decreased by `b[i]`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - If the loop completes without printing "NO", "YES" is printed.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `t` is read and parsed as an integer, representing the number of test cases.
   
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, `func_1` is called.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - If `t` is invalid, "Invalid input format" is printed.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The core logic of `func_1` correctly simulates the game mechanics:
  - It calculates the total health of monsters at each distance from the player.
  - It checks if the player can survive by ensuring that the remaining bullets (`r`) are always sufficient to handle the cumulative health of monsters moving towards the player.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and ensures that the program behaves as expected for each case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct in handling the given problem statement and test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
