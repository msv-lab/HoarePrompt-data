Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1

    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n+1 integers initialized to 0. For each i (0 ≤ i < n), x_i is an integer such that -n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_1():
    try:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            x = int(input())
            
            b[abs(x)] += a[i]
            
        #State: Output State: The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, meaning the loop has executed `n` times. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the value of `x` is an input integer, and `b[abs(x)]` is increased by `a[i]`. Therefore, after all iterations, the list `b` will have been updated such that for each index `j` (where `1` ≤ `j` ≤ `max(abs(a))`), `b[j]` will be the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` where `abs(a[i]) == j`.
        #
        #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `b` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in list `a` grouped by their absolute values.
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            
            r -= b[i]
            
        #State: Output State: `r` is `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:n])`.
        #
        #To understand this, let's break down the process:
        #
        #- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. 
        #- In each iteration, `r` is incremented by `k` and then decreased by `b[i]`.
        #- After `n` iterations, `r` will have been incremented `n` times by `k` and decreased `n` times by the sum of the first `n` elements of the list `b`.
        #
        #So, the final value of `r` will be `k * n - sum(b[1:n])`. However, since the loop stops as soon as `r < b[i]`, the actual number of iterations could be less than `n` if `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:i-1]) < b[i]` for some `i`. But based on the given information, we assume the loop runs for all `n` iterations without any early termination conditions affecting the general formula derived.
        #
        #Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is `r` being `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:n])`.
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `r` is `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:n])` if no `ValueError` occurs; otherwise, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for \( n \), \( k \), a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a list \( b \) of \( n+1 \) zeros. It then updates list \( b \) such that for each index \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq j \leq \text{max}(\text{abs}(a)) \)), \( b[j] \) contains the sum of \( a[i] \) for all \( i \) where \( \text{abs}(a[i]) = j \). After updating \( b \), the function iterates through the first \( n \) elements of \( b \) and calculates a running total \( r \) by adding \( k \) and then subtracting each element of \( b \). If at any point \( r \) becomes less than the current element of \( b \), the function prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. If the input format is invalid, the function prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases; n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9; a_i and x_i are integers for each monster such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n with x_i ≠ 0.
def func_2():
    try:
        t = int(input())
        for _ in range(t):
            func_1()
            
        #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.
        #
        #In natural language: The value of `t` must be at least 0 after all the iterations of the loop have finished. This is because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, and even if `t` becomes 0, the loop will stop executing. Therefore, regardless of how many times the loop runs, `t` cannot become negative.
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k`, and lists of integers `a_i` and `x_i`. It ensures that the input `t` is non-negative. If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'. After processing all test cases, the function guarantees that the value of `t` is at least 0.
