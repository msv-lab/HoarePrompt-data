Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without any of them reaching the player's starting position (point 0).

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the maximum number of bullets `k`.
   - It then reads the health points (`a`) and initial positions (`x`) of the monsters.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes an array `b` to keep track of the total health of monsters at each distance from the player.
   - For each monster, it updates the corresponding entry in `b` with the monster's health.
   - It iterates through the distances (from 1 to `n`), simulating the process of firing bullets and checking if the player can survive until all monsters are defeated.

3. **Checking Survival:**
   - The program keeps a running total of bullets used (`r`). For each distance, it checks if the player can use enough bullets to defeat the monsters at that distance.
   - If at any point the player cannot defeat the monsters at a certain distance, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - If the loop completes without returning, it means the player can survive, so it prints 'YES'.

4. **Handling Invalid Input:**
   - The program handles invalid input formats by catching `ValueError` exceptions and printing 'Invalid input format'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function `func_1` and `func_2` correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
