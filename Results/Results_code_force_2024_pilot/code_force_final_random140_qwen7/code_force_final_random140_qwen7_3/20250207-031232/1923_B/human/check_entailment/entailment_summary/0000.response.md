Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if a player can survive and kill all monsters without any of them reaching the player's starting position (point 0).
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is designed to process a single test case and determine if the player can survive based on the given constraints.
- `func_2` processes multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

Let's analyze the logic of `func_1`:
1. It reads the number of monsters (`n`) and the number of bullets (`k`) per second.
2. It initializes a list `b` of size `n+1` with zeros. This list is used to accumulate the total health of monsters at each distance from the player.
3. For each monster, it updates the corresponding entry in `b` with the monster's health.
4. It then iterates through the list `b` and maintains a running total `r` of the bullets fired. If at any point the running total `r` is less than the accumulated health `b[i]` for the current distance `i`, it means the player cannot kill all monsters at that distance, and it prints 'NO'.
5. If the loop completes without printing 'NO', it prints 'YES'.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary of `func_1`, the logic appears to correctly simulate the scenario and determine if the player can survive based on the constraints provided.

Now, let's consider `func_2`:
1. It reads the number of test cases (`t`).
2. It processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
3. If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'.

The logic of `func_2` also seems correct as it properly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

Since both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
