Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (inclusive), meaning `i` should range from `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is `k - 2 * b[1] + k`
   - `i` is `3`

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `4`.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `i` is now `4`, the loop will continue as long as `4 <= n + 1`, which simplifies to `n >= 3`.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to `4` and `n` must be at least `3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`r` is `k - 2 * b[1] + k`, `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 3**
