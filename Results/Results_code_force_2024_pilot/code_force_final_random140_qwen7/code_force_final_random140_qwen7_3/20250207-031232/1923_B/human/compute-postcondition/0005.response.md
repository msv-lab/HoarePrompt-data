Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used in the `range(t)` function.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than or equal to 1. Since the loop decreases `t` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `t` will be `t - 1`.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration**: Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to 0 (since it was greater than or equal to 1 and decreased by 1).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0**
