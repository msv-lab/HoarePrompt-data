You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n+1 integers initialized to 0. For each i (0 ≤ i < n), x_i is an integer such that -n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_1():
    try:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            x = int(input())
            
            b[abs(x)] += a[i]
            
        #State: Output State: The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, meaning the loop has executed `n` times. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the value of `x` is an input integer, and `b[abs(x)]` is increased by `a[i]`. Therefore, after all iterations, the list `b` will have been updated such that for each index `j` (where `1` ≤ `j` ≤ `max(abs(a))`), `b[j]` will be the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` where `abs(a[i]) == j`.
        #
        #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `b` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in list `a` grouped by their absolute values.
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            
            r -= b[i]
            
        #State: Output State: `r` is `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:n])`.
        #
        #To understand this, let's break down the process:
        #
        #- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. 
        #- In each iteration, `r` is incremented by `k` and then decreased by `b[i]`.
        #- After `n` iterations, `r` will have been incremented `n` times by `k` and decreased `n` times by the sum of the first `n` elements of the list `b`.
        #
        #So, the final value of `r` will be `k * n - sum(b[1:n])`. However, since the loop stops as soon as `r < b[i]`, the actual number of iterations could be less than `n` if `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:i-1]) < b[i]` for some `i`. But based on the given information, we assume the loop runs for all `n` iterations without any early termination conditions affecting the general formula derived.
        #
        #Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is `r` being `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:n])`.
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `r` is `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:n])` if no `ValueError` occurs; otherwise, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It either returns None or calculates and returns the value of r which is calculated as k - 2 * b[1] + 2 * k.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value since there is no value being returned in the provided code snippet.

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program returns the value of r which is calculated as k - 2 * b[1] + 2 * k
