Based on the initial state provided:

- `r` is calculated as `k - 2 * b[1] + 2 * k`. Here, `b[1]` refers to the second element of the list `b`, but since `b` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, the formula for `r` is given.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 4.
- `n` must be at least 3, but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Output: **NO**
