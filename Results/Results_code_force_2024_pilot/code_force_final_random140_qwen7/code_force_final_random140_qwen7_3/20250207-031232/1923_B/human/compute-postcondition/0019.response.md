Based on the initial state provided:

- `r` is defined as `0 + k`, so `r` is simply `k`.
- `i` is explicitly defined as `1`.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement.
- `b[i]` refers to the element in the list `b` at index `i`, which is `1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will directly print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
