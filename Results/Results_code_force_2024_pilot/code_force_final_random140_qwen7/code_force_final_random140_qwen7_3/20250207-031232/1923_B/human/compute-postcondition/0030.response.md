Output State: **`r` is `k - 2 * b[1] + 2 * k`, `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 3**

Explanation: The initial value of `r` is given as `k - 2 * b[1] + k`. After executing `r += k`, `r` is updated to `k - 2 * b[1] + k + k`, which simplifies to `k - 2 * b[1] + 2 * k`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
