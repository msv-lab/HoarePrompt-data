#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n+1 integers initialized to 0. For each i (0 ≤ i < n), x_i is an integer such that -n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_1():
    try:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            x = int(input())
            
            b[abs(x)] += a[i]
            
        #State: Output State: The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, meaning the loop has executed `n` times. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the value of `x` is an input integer, and `b[abs(x)]` is increased by `a[i]`. Therefore, after all iterations, the list `b` will have been updated such that for each index `j` (where `1` ≤ `j` ≤ `max(abs(a))`), `b[j]` will be the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` where `abs(a[i]) == j`.
        #
        #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `b` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in list `a` grouped by their absolute values.
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            
            r -= b[i]
            
        #State: Output State: `r` is `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:n])`.
        #
        #To understand this, let's break down the process:
        #
        #- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. 
        #- In each iteration, `r` is incremented by `k` and then decreased by `b[i]`.
        #- After `n` iterations, `r` will have been incremented `n` times by `k` and decreased `n` times by the sum of the first `n` elements of the list `b`.
        #
        #So, the final value of `r` will be `k * n - sum(b[1:n])`. However, since the loop stops as soon as `r < b[i]`, the actual number of iterations could be less than `n` if `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:i-1]) < b[i]` for some `i`. But based on the given information, we assume the loop runs for all `n` iterations without any early termination conditions affecting the general formula derived.
        #
        #Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is `r` being `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:n])`.
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `r` is `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:n])` if no `ValueError` occurs; otherwise, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for \( n \), \( k \), a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a list \( b \) of \( n+1 \) zeros. It then updates list \( b \) such that for each index \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq j \leq \text{max}(\text{abs}(a)) \)), \( b[j] \) contains the sum of \( a[i] \) for all \( i \) where \( \text{abs}(a[i]) = j \). After updating \( b \), the function iterates through the first \( n \) elements of \( b \) and calculates a running total \( r \) by adding \( k \) and then subtracting each element of \( b \). If at any point \( r \) becomes less than the current element of \( b \), the function prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. If the input format is invalid, the function prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases; n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9; a_i and x_i are integers for each monster such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n with x_i ≠ 0.
def func_2():
    try:
        t = int(input())
        for _ in range(t):
            func_1()
            
        #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.
        #
        #In natural language: The value of `t` must be at least 0 after all the iterations of the loop have finished. This is because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, and even if `t` becomes 0, the loop will stop executing. Therefore, regardless of how many times the loop runs, `t` cannot become negative.
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k`, and lists of integers `a_i` and `x_i`. It ensures that the input `t` is non-negative. If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'. After processing all test cases, the function guarantees that the value of `t` is at least 0.
