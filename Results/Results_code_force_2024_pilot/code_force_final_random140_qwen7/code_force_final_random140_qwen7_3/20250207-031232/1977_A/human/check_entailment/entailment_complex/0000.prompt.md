Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\). After all iterations of the loop, if `n` is less than `m` at any point, the loop will print 'NO' and continue with the next iteration. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even, the loop will print 'YES'. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged unless they are updated within the loop, which does not happen based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: `t`, `n`, and `m`. For each test case, it checks if `n` is less than `m`; if true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even; if true, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the specified conditions for each test case.
