Reasoning:
The given program aims to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move involves adding or removing one cube. The logic in the program checks if `n` is less than `m`, which is an incorrect condition because adding cubes can never result in fewer cubes than the number of moves made. Instead, the logic should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, as each pair of add and remove operations cancels out to zero net change in the number of cubes.

The current logic:
- Prints 'NO' if `n < m`, which is incorrect.
- Prints 'YES' if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, which is also incorrect because it doesn't account for the parity of the difference between `n` and `m`.

The correct logic should be:
- Print 'YES' if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even.
- Print 'NO' if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is odd.

Given this analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
