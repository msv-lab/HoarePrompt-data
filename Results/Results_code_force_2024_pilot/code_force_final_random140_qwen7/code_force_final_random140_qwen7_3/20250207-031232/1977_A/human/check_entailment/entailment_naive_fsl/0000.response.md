Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program checks if `n` is less than `m`, which is not a valid condition according to the problem description. Instead, the program should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves determines whether the final number of cubes can match `m`.

A correct implementation would be:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This version correctly checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for Nikita to be able to achieve a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
