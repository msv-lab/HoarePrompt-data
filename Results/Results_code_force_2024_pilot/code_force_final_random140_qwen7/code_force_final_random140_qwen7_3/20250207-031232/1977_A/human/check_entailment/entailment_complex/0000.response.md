Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- The logic in the program checks if `n` is less than `m`. If `n < m`, it prints 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves made.
- The program then checks if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even using the bitwise AND operator (`&`). This check is necessary because the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the final number of cubes in the tower. If `n` is even and `m` is odd, or vice versa, it would be impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

Given these points, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
