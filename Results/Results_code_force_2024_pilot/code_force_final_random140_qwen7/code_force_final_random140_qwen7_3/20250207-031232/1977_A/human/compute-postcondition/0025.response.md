Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user converted to an integer, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user converted to an integer. If `n` is less than `m`, the program continues with these values of `t`, `n`, and `m`. Otherwise, the program continues with `n` and `m` being either both odd or both even.**
