Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user converted to an integer, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user converted to an integer, and if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even. Regardless of the condition in the if statement, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**
