Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, and `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user. If `n` is less than `m`, there are no additional changes. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, then both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even.
