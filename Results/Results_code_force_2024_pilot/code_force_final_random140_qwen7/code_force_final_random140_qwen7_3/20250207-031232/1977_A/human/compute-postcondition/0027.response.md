Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). It does not return a specific value but rather processes these inputs according to certain conditions or operations defined within the function body.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `t`, `n`, and `m`. The function will process these integers based on the given constraints and perform some operations or checks, though the exact operations are not specified in the provided information.
