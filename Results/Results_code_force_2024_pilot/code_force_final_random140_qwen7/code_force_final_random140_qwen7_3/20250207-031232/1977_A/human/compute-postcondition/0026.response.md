Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\). After all iterations of the loop, if `n` is less than `m` at any point, the loop will print 'NO' and continue with the next iteration. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even, the loop will print 'YES'. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged unless they are updated within the loop, which does not happen based on the given conditions.**

This means that after all iterations, the final values of `n` and `m` will depend on the last valid pair entered by the user that satisfies the condition `n >= m` and either both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even. If at any point `n < m`, the loop will print 'NO' and proceed to the next iteration without changing `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains as it was initially set.
