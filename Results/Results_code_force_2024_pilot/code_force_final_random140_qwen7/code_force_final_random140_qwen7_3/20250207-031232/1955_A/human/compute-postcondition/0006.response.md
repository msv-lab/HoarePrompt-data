Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `b` is the third integer from the new input, `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `t`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged from their initial state. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now updated to the integers provided by the user.
