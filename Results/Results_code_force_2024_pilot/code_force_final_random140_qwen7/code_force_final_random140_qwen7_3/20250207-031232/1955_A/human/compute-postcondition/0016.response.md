Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all test cases specified by the initial integer `t` have been processed. After all iterations, the following will be true:

- `t` will be the initial input integer specifying the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the most recent values entered by the user during that iteration.
- `s1` will be the value of `n * a` for the last processed test case.
- `s2` will be the value of `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a` for the last processed test case.
- The final output will be the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for the last processed test case, printed for each test case as the loop progresses.

This means that after all iterations, the output will consist of the minimum values of `s1` and `s2` calculated for each of the `t` test cases, printed one per line in the order they were processed.
