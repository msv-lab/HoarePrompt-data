Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `b` is the third integer from the new input, `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `s1 = n * a` simply reassigns the value of `s1` to be `n * a`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s1`, or `s2` in a way that would require updating their values. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values entered by the user, but since no new values are assigned to them within this snippet, they remain as the user inputs. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state.
