Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all test cases specified by the initial integer `t` have been processed. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` test cases will have been handled, with each test case involving the calculation of `s1` and `s2` as defined by the formulas `s1 = n * a` and `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. For each test case, the minimum value between `s1` and `s2` will be printed. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated according to the inputs provided for each test case, and `s1` and `s2` will reflect the latest values calculated based on the most recent `n`, `a`, and `b`.

All other variables outside the loop, including the initial value of `t`, will remain unchanged after the loop completes.
