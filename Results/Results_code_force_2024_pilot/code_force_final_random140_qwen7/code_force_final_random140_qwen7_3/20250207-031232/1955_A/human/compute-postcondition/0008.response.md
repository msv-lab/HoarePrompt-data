Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `b` is the third integer from the new input, `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code does not change any of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s1`, `s2`). Instead, it updates the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` to the new input values provided by the user. The value of `s2` is recalculated using the updated values of `n` and `a` based on the formula `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
