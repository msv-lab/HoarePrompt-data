Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `n` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `a` is the second integer from the new input.
   - `b` is the third integer from the new input.
   - `s1` is calculated as `n * a`.
   - `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(min(s1, s2))` will print the minimum value between `s1` and `s2`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to express `s1` and `s2` in terms of `n`, `a`, and `b`:
- `s1 = n * a`
- `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`

We need to consider two cases for `n // 2` and `n % 2`:
- If `n` is even, then `n // 2` is `n / 2` and `n % 2` is `0`.
- If `n` is odd, then `n // 2` is `(n - 1) / 2` and `n % 2` is `1`.

In both cases, `s2` simplifies to:
- If `n` is even: `s2 = b * (n // 2) + 0 * a = b * (n // 2)`
- If `n` is odd: `s2 = b * ((n - 1) // 2) + 1 * a = b * ((n - 1) // 2) + a`

Now, we compare `s1` and `s2`:
- `s1 = n * a`
- `s2 = b * (n // 2)` if `n` is even, or `b * ((n - 1) // 2) + a` if `n` is odd.

The minimum value between `s1` and `s2` will depend on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not specified, we can only describe the expression for the minimum value.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum of `n * a` and either `b * (n // 2)` (if `n` is even) or `b * ((n - 1) // 2) + a` (if `n` is odd).

Output: **min(n * a, b * (n // 2) if n is even else b * ((n - 1) // 2) + a)**
