You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        s1 = n * a
        
        s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a
        
        print(min(s1, s2))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all test cases specified by the initial integer `t` have been processed. After all iterations, the following will be true:
    #
    #- `t` will be the initial input integer specifying the number of test cases.
    #- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the most recent values entered by the user during that iteration.
    #- `s1` will be the value of `n * a` for the last processed test case.
    #- `s2` will be the value of `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a` for the last processed test case.
    #- The final output will be the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for the last processed test case, printed for each test case as the loop progresses.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the output will consist of the minimum values of `s1` and `s2` calculated for each of the `t` test cases, printed one per line in the order they were processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers: t, n, a, and b. The integer t represents the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. The function does not return a specific value but rather processes these integers according to their constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
