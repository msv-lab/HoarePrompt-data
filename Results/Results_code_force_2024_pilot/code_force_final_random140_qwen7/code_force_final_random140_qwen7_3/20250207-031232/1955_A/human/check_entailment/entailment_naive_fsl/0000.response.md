Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given promotion rules. Here's why:

1. The program iterates over the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it calculates the total cost in two ways:
   - `s1 = n * a`: This represents the cost if each yogurt is bought individually at the regular price `a`.
   - `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`: This represents the cost if pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotion price `b`, and any remaining yogurt is bought individually at the regular price `a`.
3. It then prints the minimum of these two costs.

Given the constraints and the logic used, the program handles all potential cases correctly. For instance:
- In the third test case (3 yogurts, price per yogurt 5, promotion price for two 11), the program correctly calculates the minimum cost as 15 (buying 3 yogurts at 5 each).
- In the fourth test case (4 yogurts, price per yogurt 5, promotion price for two 11), the program correctly calculates the minimum cost as 20 (buying 2 pairs at 11 each).

Since the program accurately computes the minimum cost for all given examples and potential cases within the described problem, it is correct.
