### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `s1 = n * a`: This calculates the cost if each yogurt is bought individually at the regular price `a`.
   - `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`: This calculates the cost if pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotion price `b`, and any remaining yogurt is bought individually at the regular price `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for each test case.

The original assessment claims that the program is correct because it handles all potential cases correctly. Let's validate this claim with the provided examples and general logic.

#### Example Analysis:
1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculations:
     - `s1 = 2 * 5 = 10`
     - `s2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 5 = 9 * 1 + 0 * 5 = 9`
   - Minimum cost: `min(10, 9) = 9`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculations:
     - `s1 = 3 * 5 = 15`
     - `s2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 5 = 9 * 1 + 1 * 5 = 14`
   - Minimum cost: `min(15, 14) = 14`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculations:
     - `s1 = 3 * 5 = 15`
     - `s2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 5 = 11 * 1 + 1 * 5 = 16`
   - Minimum cost: `min(15, 16) = 15`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculations:
     - `s1 = 4 * 5 = 20`
     - `s2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 4 % 2 * 5 = 11 * 2 + 0 * 5 = 22`
   - Minimum cost: `min(20, 22) = 20`

From the above calculations, we can see that the program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case. The logic used in the program is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given promotion rules.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
