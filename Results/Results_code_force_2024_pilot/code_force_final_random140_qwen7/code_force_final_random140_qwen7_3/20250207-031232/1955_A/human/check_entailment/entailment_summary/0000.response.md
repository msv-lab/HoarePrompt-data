Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying \( n \) yogurts under the given conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
3. It calculates two possible total costs:
   - \( s1 = n \times a \): This represents the cost if Maxim buys each yogurt individually at the regular price.
   - \( s2 = b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a \): This represents the cost if Maxim takes advantage of the promotion for every pair of yogurts and buys any remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
4. It then prints the minimum of these two calculated costs for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program accurately follows the required logic. There are no logical errors or omissions that would make the program incorrect.

Correctness: **True**
