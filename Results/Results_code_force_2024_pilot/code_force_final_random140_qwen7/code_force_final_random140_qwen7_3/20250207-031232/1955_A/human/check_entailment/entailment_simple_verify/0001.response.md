### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step to confirm the correctness of the program.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculating Costs**:
   - `s1` is calculated as `n * a`, which is the total cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price.
   - `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. This formula accounts for the promotion price:
     - `n // 2` gives the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price.
     - `n % 2` gives the number of remaining yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2`, which is the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

#### Verification with Examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - `s1 = 2 * 5 = 10`
   - `s2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 5 = 9 * 1 + 0 * 5 = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - `s1 = 3 * 5 = 15`
   - `s2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 5 = 9 * 1 + 1 * 5 = 14`
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - `s1 = 3 * 5 = 15`
   - `s2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 5 = 11 * 1 + 1 * 5 = 16`
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - `s1 = 4 * 5 = 20`
   - `s2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 4 % 2 * 5 = 11 * 2 + 0 * 5 = 22`
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

#### Annotations and Program Behavior:

- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The calculations for `s1` and `s2` are performed accurately according to the problem statement.
- The minimum cost is correctly determined and printed for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis and verification, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
