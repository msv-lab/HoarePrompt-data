Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the prices `a` (regular price for one yogurt) and `b` (promotion price for two yogurts). The program iterates over the number of test cases, calculates the total cost using both the regular pricing and the promotion pricing, and then prints the minimum of the two costs for each test case. This matches the problem description and examples provided.
