Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program accurately calculates the minimum cost for buying \( n \) yogurts under the given promotion rules. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step using the provided function summary and the problem description.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates two expressions:
     - \( s1 = n \times a \): This represents the cost if each yogurt is bought individually at the regular price \( a \).
     - \( s2 = b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a \): This represents the cost if pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotion price \( b \), and any remaining yogurt is bought individually at the regular price \( a \).
   - It then prints the minimum of these two values.

2. **Problem Description Verification**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to buy \( n \) yogurts, considering the regular price \( a \) and the promotion price \( b \) for two yogurts.
   - The program correctly handles the logic for both individual purchases and promotional purchases.

3. **Edge Cases and Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
     - \( s1 = 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
     - \( s2 = 9 \)
     - Minimum cost: \( \min(10, 9) = 9 \)
   - **Example 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
     - \( s1 = 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
     - \( s2 = 9 + 5 = 14 \)
     - Minimum cost: \( \min(15, 14) = 14 \)
   - **Example 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
     - \( s1 = 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
     - \( s2 = 11 + 5 = 16 \)
     - Minimum cost: \( \min(15, 16) = 15 \)
   - **Example 4**: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
     - \( s1 = 4 \times 5 = 20 \)
     - \( s2 = 2 \times 11 = 22 \)
     - Minimum cost: \( \min(20, 22) = 20 \)

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for each test case, and the provided examples confirm its accuracy.

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
