Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts without any promotion (`s1 = n * a`).
- It also calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion as much as possible (`s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`).
- Finally, it prints the minimum of these two costs for each test case.
- The logic for calculating the minimum cost is correct. If `b` is less than `2 * a`, it's cheaper to use the promotion. Otherwise, it's better to buy each yogurt individually.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
