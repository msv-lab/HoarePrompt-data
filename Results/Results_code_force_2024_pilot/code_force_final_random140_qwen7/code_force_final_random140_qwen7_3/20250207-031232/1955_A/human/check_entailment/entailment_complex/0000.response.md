Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for purchasing \( n \) yogurts under the given conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case, reading \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) for each case.

2. **Cost Calculations**:
   - \( s1 = n \times a \): This represents the total cost if each yogurt is bought individually at the regular price \( a \).
   - \( s2 = b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a \): This represents the total cost if the maximum number of pairs (each pair costing \( b \)) are bought, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price \( a \).

3. **Minimum Cost Determination**: The program prints the minimum of \( s1 \) and \( s2 \) for each test case, which ensures that the cost is minimized according to the given conditions.

4. **Loop Execution**: The loop continues to process each test case until all \( t \) test cases are completed, ensuring that the output for each test case is printed in the correct order.

Given the logic and the provided example, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
