### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Stepan can send all \( n \) messages with the given initial charge \( f \).
   - The phone loses \( a \) units of charge per unit of time.
   - Turning the phone off and on consumes \( b \) units of energy.
   - If the phone's charge drops to 0 or below, it cannot send further messages.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It initializes an array `arr` with the first element as 0 and the rest as the given message times.
   - It sets a boolean variable `possible` to `True`, assuming initially that it is possible to send all messages.
   - It iterates through the message times and calculates the energy cost for sending each message either by keeping the phone on or by turning it off and on.
   - The energy cost is determined by taking the minimum of the energy required to keep the phone on for the duration between two messages (`energy_keep_on`) and the energy required to turn the phone off and on (`energy_turn_off_on`).
   - If the current charge \( f \) is less than or equal to the calculated energy cost, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints 'YES' if `possible` is still `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly calculates the energy cost for each message.
   - It correctly updates the charge and checks if the charge is sufficient.
   - The approach of checking the minimum energy cost ensures that the phone is used optimally.
   - The code handles the edge case where the charge might drop to 0 or below, making it impossible to send further messages.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to 0 or below.

### Correctness:
**True**
