Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. The list m contains n integers such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
            energy_turn_off_on = b
            energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
            if f <= energy_cost:
                possible = False
                break
            f -= energy_cost
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `f` is `f - total_energy_cost`, `i` is `n + 1`, `possible` is `False`.
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `f` will have been reduced by the total energy cost (`total_energy_cost`) calculated over all iterations. The value of `i` will be `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `possible` will be set to `False` because the loop eventually sets it to `False` when `f` becomes insufficient to cover the `energy_cost` for any iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` along with a list `m` of `n` integers. It then calculates the energy cost to keep a device on or turn it off at each step and checks if the available energy `f` is sufficient to cover these costs without depleting below zero. If `f` ever falls below the required energy cost, it sets `possible` to `False`. After processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' if `possible` remains `True` for all cases, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function modifies the input variable `f` by subtracting the total energy cost across all iterations.
