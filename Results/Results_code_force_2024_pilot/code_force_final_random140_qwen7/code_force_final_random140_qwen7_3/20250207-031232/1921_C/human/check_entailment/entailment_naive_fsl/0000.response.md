Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the phone's charge might be insufficient even if the energy cost is calculated correctly. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that the phone might run out of charge between two consecutive messages if the remaining charge is less than `a` (charge loss per unit of time) but more than `b` (energy cost of turning off and on).

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
3 10 5 2
1 6 11
```
- Expected Output:
```
NO
```
- Program Output:
```
YES
```

In this case:
- At moment 0, the phone has 10 units of charge.
- Between moment 0 and moment 1, the phone loses 5 units of charge, leaving 5 units.
- Between moment 1 and moment 6, the phone loses 5 units of charge, leaving 0 units.
- Between moment 6 and moment 11, the phone would need to lose another 5 units of charge, but since the phone has 0 units of charge, it cannot send the message at moment 11.

The program incorrectly assumes that if the remaining charge is greater than `b`, the phone can always turn off and on without running out of charge. However, if the remaining charge is less than `a`, the phone will run out of charge before reaching the next message.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, making it incorrect.
