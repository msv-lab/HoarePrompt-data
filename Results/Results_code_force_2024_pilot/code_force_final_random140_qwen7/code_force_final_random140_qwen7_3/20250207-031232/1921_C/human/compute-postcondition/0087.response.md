Output State: **`possible` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`, the value of `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no loop or conditional statement was specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional context. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated values.
