Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a * time_diff` to the variable `energy_keep_on`. Given that `time_diff` is initially `arr[3] - arr[2]`, the new value of `energy_keep_on` is calculated as `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`. The values of `i` and `time_diff` remain unchanged from their initial states.
