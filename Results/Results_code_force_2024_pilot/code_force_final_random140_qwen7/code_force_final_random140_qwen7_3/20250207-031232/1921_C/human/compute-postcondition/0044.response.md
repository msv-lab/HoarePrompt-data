Output State: **`i` is 1; `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`; `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a * time_diff` to the variable `energy_keep_on`. Given that `time_diff` is initially `arr[1] - arr[0]`, the new value of `energy_keep_on` is calculated as `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`. The values of `i` and `time_diff` remain unchanged from their initial states.
