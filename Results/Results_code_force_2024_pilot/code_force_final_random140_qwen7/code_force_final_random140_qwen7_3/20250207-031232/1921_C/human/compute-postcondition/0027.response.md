Output State: **`f` is reduced by `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False`, `i` is `i + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` and assigns this difference to the variable `time_diff`. The values of `f`, `possible`, and `i` are updated according to their previous states, while `time_diff` is newly introduced with the calculated value.
