Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`**

Explanation: The line `possible = False` sets the variable `possible` to `False`. The other variables (`i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, and `energy_turn_off_on`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
