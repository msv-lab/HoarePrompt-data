Output State: `f` is `f - total_energy_cost`, `i` is `n + 1`, `possible` is `False`.

After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `f` will have been reduced by the total energy cost (`total_energy_cost`) calculated over all iterations. The value of `i` will be `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `possible` will be set to `False` because the loop eventually sets it to `False` when `f` becomes insufficient to cover the `energy_cost` for any iteration.
