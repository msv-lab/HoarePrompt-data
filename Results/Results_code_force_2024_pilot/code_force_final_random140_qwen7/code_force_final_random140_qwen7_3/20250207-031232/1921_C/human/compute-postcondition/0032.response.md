Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `possible`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, and `energy_turn_off_on`.
