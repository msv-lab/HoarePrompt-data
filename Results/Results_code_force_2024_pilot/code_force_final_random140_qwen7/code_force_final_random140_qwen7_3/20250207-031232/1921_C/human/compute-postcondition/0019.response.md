Output State: **`i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `b`, and `f` is reduced by `b`.**

Explanation: The code sets `energy_turn_off_on` to `b`. This changes the value of `energy_turn_off_on` directly. Since `energy_cost` is defined as `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, and `energy_turn_off_on` is now `b`, `energy_cost` also becomes `b`. The other variables (`i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, and `f`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
