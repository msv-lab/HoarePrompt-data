Output State: **`i` is 1; `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`; `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`; `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`; `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`**.

This means that the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, `time_diff` remains as `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` remains as `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` remains as `b`, and a new variable `energy_cost` is assigned the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`.
