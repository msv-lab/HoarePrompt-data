Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`. For the loop to start, `i` should be at least `1` and `n` should be at least `1`.

4. **Check the current state**:
   - `i` is currently set to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, and the loop starts when `i` is `1`, `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to start.
   - `i` should be adjusted to `1` at the beginning of the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `i` should be `1`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
