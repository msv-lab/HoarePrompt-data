Output State: **`f` is reduced by `energy_cost`, and `possible` is `False`.**

Explanation: The variable `f` is reduced by the value of `energy_cost`, which is `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`. The value of `possible` remains `False` because it was set to `False` in the initial state and there is no code that changes its value. The other variables (`i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
