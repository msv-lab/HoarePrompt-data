Output State: **`f` is `f - energy_cost`, `i` is `n + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * time_diff, b)`, `possible` is `False`**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is set to `False`, but none of the other variables (`f`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
