Output State: **`i` is 1; `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in the list `arr`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `time_diff` is set to `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.
