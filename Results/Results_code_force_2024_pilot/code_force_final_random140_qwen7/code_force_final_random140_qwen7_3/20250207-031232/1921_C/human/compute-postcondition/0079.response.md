Output State: **`i` is `n`, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, `possible` is `True`, `t` is `0`, `arr` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))**.

Explanation: The variable `possible` is set to `True`. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
