Output State: **`f` is `f - energy_cost`, `i` is `n + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `a * time_diff`**

Explanation: The code updates `energy_keep_on` to `a * time_diff`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `energy_cost` is now equal to `a * time_diff` because the code reassigns `energy_keep_on` to `a * time_diff`, and `energy_cost` is defined as the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Since `energy_keep_on` is updated to `a * time_diff`, `energy_cost` also becomes `a * time_diff`.
