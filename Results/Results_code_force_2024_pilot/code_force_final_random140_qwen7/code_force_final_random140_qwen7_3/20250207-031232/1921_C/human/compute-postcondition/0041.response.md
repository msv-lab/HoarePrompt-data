Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `f` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `True`, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` hold the values calculated during the last iteration, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers read from input.**

Explanation: The line `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
