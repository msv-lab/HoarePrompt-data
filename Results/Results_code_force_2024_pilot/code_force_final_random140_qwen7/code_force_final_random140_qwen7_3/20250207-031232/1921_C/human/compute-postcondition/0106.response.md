Output State: **`f` is `f - 2 * energy_cost`, `i` is `2`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`**.

Explanation: The line `possible = False` sets the variable `possible` to `False`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `f`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` remain unchanged from their initial states.
