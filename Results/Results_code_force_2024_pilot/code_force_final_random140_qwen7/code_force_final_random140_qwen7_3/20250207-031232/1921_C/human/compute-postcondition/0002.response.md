Output State: **`t` is an input integer and greater than 0, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `m` is not yet defined.**

The code splits the input into four integers and assigns them to `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not part of the input split. Therefore, `t` is still an input integer and greater than 0. The values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are the integers obtained from the input split, and `m` is not yet defined.
