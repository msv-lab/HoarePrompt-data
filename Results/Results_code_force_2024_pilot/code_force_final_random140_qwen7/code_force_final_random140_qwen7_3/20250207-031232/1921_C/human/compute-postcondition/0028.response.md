Output State: **`f` is reduced by `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False`, `i` is `i + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`**.

This means that the variable `energy_keep_on` is now assigned the value of `a * time_diff`. The other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
