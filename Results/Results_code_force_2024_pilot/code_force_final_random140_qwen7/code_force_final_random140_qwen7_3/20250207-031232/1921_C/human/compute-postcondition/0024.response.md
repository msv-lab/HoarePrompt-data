Postcondition: `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`, and `f` is reduced by `b`, and `possible` is `False`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
