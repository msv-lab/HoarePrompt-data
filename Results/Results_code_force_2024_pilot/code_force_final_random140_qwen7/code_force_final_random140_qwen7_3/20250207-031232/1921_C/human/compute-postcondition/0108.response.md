Postcondition: **`f` is `f - 2 * energy_cost`, `i` is `2`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `f <= energy_cost`.**
