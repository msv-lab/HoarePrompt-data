Output State: **`f` is `f - 2 * energy_cost`, `i` is `2`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `energy_keep_on` to `a * time_diff`. Given that `time_diff` is defined as `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, the new value of `energy_keep_on` becomes `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
