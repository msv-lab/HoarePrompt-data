Output State: `i` is `n`, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, and `possible` is `False`.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has gone through all integers from 1 to `n`. The `time_diff` will be the difference between the last two elements in the `arr` list, `arr[n]` and `arr[n-1]`. The `energy_keep_on` will be `a` multiplied by `time_diff`. `energy_turn_off_on` remains as `b`. `energy_cost` will be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Since the loop breaks when `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `f` will be reduced by `energy_cost` after the last iteration. Finally, `possible` is set to `False` because the loop breaks as soon as `f` is not sufficient to cover the cost, which happens at some point during the iterations.
