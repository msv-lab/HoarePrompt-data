Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b) - energy_cost`, `possible` is `False`, and `f` is `f - energy_cost`**.

Explanation: The value of `f` is decreased by `energy_cost`, which is the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
