Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n - 1]`**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the `n`-th element and the `(n-1)`-th element in the list `arr` and assigns this difference to the variable `time_diff`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
