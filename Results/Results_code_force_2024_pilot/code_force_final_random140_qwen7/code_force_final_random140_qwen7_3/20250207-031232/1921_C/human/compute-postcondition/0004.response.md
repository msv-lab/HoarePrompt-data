Output State: **`t` is an input integer and greater than 0, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `m` is not yet defined, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers split from the input, `possible` is set to `True`**.

In this case, the code simply assigns `True` to the variable `possible`. No other changes are made to the variables or their values. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the assignment of `True` to `possible`.
