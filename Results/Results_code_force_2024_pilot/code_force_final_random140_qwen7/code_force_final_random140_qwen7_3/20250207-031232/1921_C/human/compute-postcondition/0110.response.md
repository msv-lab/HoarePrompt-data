Output State: `f` is `f - (number_of_iterations * energy_cost)`, `i` is `n + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`.

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `f` will be reduced by the total energy cost (`energy_cost`) for each iteration that was completed, which is `number_of_iterations * energy_cost`. The variable `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from `1` to `n + 1`. The `time_diff` will be the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` for the last iteration. The `energy_keep_on` is calculated as `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` remains `b`, and `energy_cost` is the minimum of these two values. Since the loop breaks when `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False`.
