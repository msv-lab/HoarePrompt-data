Postcondition: `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, and `possible` is `False`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
