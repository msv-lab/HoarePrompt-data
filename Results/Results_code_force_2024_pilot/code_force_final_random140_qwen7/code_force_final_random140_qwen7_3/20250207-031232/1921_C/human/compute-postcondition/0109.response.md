Output State: **`f` is `f - 2 * energy_cost - energy_cost`, `i` is `2`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code `f -= energy_cost` subtracts `energy_cost` from `f`. Since `energy_cost` is defined as `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, the updated value of `f` becomes `f - 2 * energy_cost - energy_cost`, which simplifies to `f - 3 * energy_cost`. All other variables remain unchanged.
