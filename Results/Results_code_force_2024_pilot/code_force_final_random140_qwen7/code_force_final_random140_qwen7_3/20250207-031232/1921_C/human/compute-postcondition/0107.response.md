Output State: **`f` is `f - 2 * energy_cost`, `i` is `2`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `possible` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only causes the loop or conditional block to terminate. Therefore, the values of `f`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, and `possible` remain unchanged. We also note that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
