Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`**.

In this output state, the variable `energy_cost` is assigned the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
