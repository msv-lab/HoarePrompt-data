Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value `b` to the variable `energy_turn_off_on`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the original conditions plus the new assignment for `energy_turn_off_on`.
