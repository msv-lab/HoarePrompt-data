Output State: `f` is `f - total_energy_cost`, `i` is `n + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * time_diff, b)`, `possible` is `False`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `f` will have been reduced by the total energy cost (`total_energy_cost`) calculated over all iterations. The value of `i` will be `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `time_diff` will be the difference between the last two timestamps in the array `arr`. The `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on` remain as defined, and `energy_cost` will be the minimum of these two values. Since the loop breaks when `f` is less than or equal to the energy cost, `possible` will be set to `False`.
