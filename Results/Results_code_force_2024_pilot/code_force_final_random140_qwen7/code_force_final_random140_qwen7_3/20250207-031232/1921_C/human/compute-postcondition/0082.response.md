Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a * time_diff` to the variable `energy_keep_on`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `time_diff` remain unchanged from their initial states.
