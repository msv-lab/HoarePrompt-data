Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `i - 1` is 2. Therefore, `time_diff` is assigned the value of `arr[3] - arr[2]`. The initial value of `i` is 3, which remains unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 is still valid, but since `n` is not directly involved in the calculation, its specific value is not updated.
