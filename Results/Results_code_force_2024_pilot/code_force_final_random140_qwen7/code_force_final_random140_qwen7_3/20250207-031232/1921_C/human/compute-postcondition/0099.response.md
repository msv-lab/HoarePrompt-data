Postcondition: **`f` is `f - energy_cost`, `i` is `n + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * time_diff, b)`, and `possible` is `False`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
