Postcondition: `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`, and if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, then `possible` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `f` is greater than `energy_cost`, then the else part does not execute, and the values remain as they were before the if statement.
