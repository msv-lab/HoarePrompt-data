Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `f` is reduced by `energy_cost`.
   - `possible` is `False`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i < n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `possible` remains `False` because the loop condition does not change the value of `possible`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `f` remains reduced by `energy_cost`.
- `possible` remains `False`.

Since the exact initial values of `i` and `n` are not provided, we can express the state in terms of these variables.

**State: **`f` is reduced by `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n`**.
