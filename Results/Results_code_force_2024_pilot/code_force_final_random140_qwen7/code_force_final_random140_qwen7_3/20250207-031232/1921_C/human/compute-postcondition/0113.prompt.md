Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and we are ready to read the next input for `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `m`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    possible = True
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
        energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
        energy_turn_off_on = b
        energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
        if f <= energy_cost:
            possible = False
            break
        f -= energy_cost
    print('YES' if possible else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in `f` being reduced to a value that is less than or equal to `energy_cost` after the last iteration. `possible` is set to `False`, indicating that it was not possible to satisfy the condition `f > energy_cost` throughout the entire loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop iterates from 1 to `n`. The variables `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` will hold the values calculated during the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `n`, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, and `possible` is `False`.

In this final output state, the loop has executed all its iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n`. The variable `i` has reached its upper limit `n`. The `time_diff` is calculated as the difference between the last two elements in the `arr` list. The `energy_keep_on` is computed as `a` multiplied by `time_diff`. The `energy_turn_off_on` remains constant at `b`. The `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `f` is reduced by `energy_cost`. After all iterations, `possible` will be `False` because the loop eventually sets it to `False` when `f` becomes insufficient to cover the `energy_cost`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `f` is `f - total_energy_cost`, `i` is `n + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * time_diff, b)`, `possible` is `False`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `f` will have been reduced by the total energy cost (`total_energy_cost`) calculated over all iterations. The value of `i` will be `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `time_diff` will be the difference between the last two timestamps in the array `arr`. The `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on` remain as defined, and `energy_cost` will be the minimum of these two values. Since the loop breaks when `f` is less than or equal to the energy cost, `possible` will be set to `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
