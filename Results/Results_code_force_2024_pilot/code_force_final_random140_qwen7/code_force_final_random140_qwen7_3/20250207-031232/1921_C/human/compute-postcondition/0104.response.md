Output State: **`f` is `f - 2 * energy_cost`, `i` is `2`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`**

Explanation: The code `energy_turn_off_on = b` simply reassigns the value of `energy_turn_off_on` to `b`. No other variables are affected, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
