Output State: **`f` is `f - 2 * energy_cost`, `i` is `2`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `time_diff` to `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is `2`, `time_diff` is updated to `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
