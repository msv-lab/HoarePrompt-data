Output State: `i` is `n`, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, and `possible` is `False`.

In this final output state, the loop has executed all its iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n`. The variable `i` has reached its upper limit `n`. The `time_diff` is calculated as the difference between the last two elements in the `arr` list. The `energy_keep_on` is computed as `a` multiplied by `time_diff`. The `energy_turn_off_on` remains constant at `b`. The `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `f` is reduced by `energy_cost`. After all iterations, `possible` will be `False` because the loop eventually sets it to `False` when `f` becomes insufficient to cover the `energy_cost`.
