Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `f` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False`, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` hold the values calculated during the last iteration.**

Explanation: The code reads four integers (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`) from input using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `f`, `possible`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` remain unchanged from their previous states. The new values of `a` and `b` are assigned to `a` and `b` respectively.
