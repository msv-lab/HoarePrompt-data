Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `f` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False`, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` hold the values calculated during the last iteration, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers read from input.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` that starts with 0 and is followed by integers read from input using `map(int, input().split())`. The other variables (`n`, `f`, `possible`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
