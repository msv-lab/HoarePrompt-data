Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in `f` being reduced to a value that is less than or equal to `energy_cost` after the last iteration. `possible` is set to `False`, indicating that it was not possible to satisfy the condition `f > energy_cost` throughout the entire loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop iterates from 1 to `n`. The variables `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` will hold the values calculated during the last iteration of the loop.**

In more detail:
- `i` will be `n` because the loop runs from 1 to `n`.
- `time_diff` will be `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`.
- `energy_keep_on` will be `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`.
- `energy_turn_off_on` will be `b`.
- `energy_cost` will be `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`.
- `f` will be reduced by `energy_cost` after the last iteration, making `f` less than or equal to `energy_cost`.
- `possible` will be `False` because the condition `f > energy_cost` could not be satisfied at any point during the loop's execution.
