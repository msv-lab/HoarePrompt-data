Based on the initial state, `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), and `k` is an integer. Both `n` and `k` are updated to the values entered by the user. The print statement is:

```python
print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The expression `('1 ' * n)` generates a string consisting of `n` repetitions of the substring `'1 '` (a space after each '1').
2. The `[:-1]` slice removes the last character from this string, which is a space.
3. Therefore, the resulting string is `n` ones separated by spaces, with no trailing space.

For example, if `n` is 5, the string generated would be `'1 1 1 1 1'`, and after removing the trailing space, it becomes `'1 1 1 1 1'`.

Output: **'1 ' repeated n times without trailing space**
