Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (1000) inclusive.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - The current value of `k` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `x + 1` is applied to each number in the sequence, so the sequence becomes 1, 2, 3, ..., n.
   - `str(x + 1)` converts each number to a string.
   - `' '.join(...)` joins these strings with a space separator.
   - The result is a single string where the numbers from 1 to n are separated by spaces.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, let's consider the general case where `n` can be any value within this range.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, the output would be "1 2 3 4 5".
   - If `n = 10`, the output would be "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10".

Given the general form, the output will always be a space-separated string of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Output: **"1 2 3 ... n" (where n is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive)**
