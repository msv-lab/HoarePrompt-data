Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `k` is an integer, and they are the values entered by the user separated by a space**.

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input from the user, separated by a space, and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` will be one of these values. The value of `k` will also be an integer but its range is not specified in the initial state, so it can be any integer.
