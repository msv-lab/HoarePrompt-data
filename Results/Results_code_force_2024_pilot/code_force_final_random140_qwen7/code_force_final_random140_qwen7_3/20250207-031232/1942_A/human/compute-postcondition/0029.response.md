Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all test cases provided by the input are processed. After all iterations, `n` and `k` will retain their original values as entered by the user for each test case. The output will consist of either a sequence of '1's or a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, depending on the conditions specified in the if-else statements, for each test case.

In more detail, for each test case:
- If `n` equals `k`, the output will be a string of `n` '1's.
- If `k` equals 1, the output will be a string of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- Otherwise, the output will be '-1' for that test case.

All these outputs will be printed sequentially based on the inputs provided.
