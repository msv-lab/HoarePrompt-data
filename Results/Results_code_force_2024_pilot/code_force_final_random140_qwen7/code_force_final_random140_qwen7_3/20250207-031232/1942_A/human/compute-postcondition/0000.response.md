Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. This value represents the number of test cases. We need to ensure that this input value is within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).

3. **Consider the initial state**: The initial state is given as `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be a valid test case count, i.e., it must be an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())` to ensure it is within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive**
