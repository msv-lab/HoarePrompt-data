Based on the initial state provided, `n` and `k` are integers entered by the user and are between 1 and \(10^3\). The code snippet prints a string consisting of `n` occurrences of the substring "1 ", but the last character (a space) is removed.

Let's break it down:

1. The expression `('1 ' * n)[:-1]` creates a string with `n` repetitions of "1 " and then removes the last character, which is a space.
2. Therefore, if `n` is, for example, 5, the string generated would be "1 1 1 1 1", and after removing the last space, it becomes "1 1 1 1".

Given this, the output will be a string of `n-1` ones followed by a space.

Output: **"1 " repeated n-1 times**
