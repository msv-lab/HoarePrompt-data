Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, where `n` and `k` are such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3, the function determines a result based on the relationship between `n` and `k` and returns it.**

Given the constraints, the function likely evaluates some condition involving `n` and `k` and returns a specific value or result based on that evaluation. However, since the exact logic isn't provided, the focus here is on the input and output structure.
