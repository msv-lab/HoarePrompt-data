Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (1000) inclusive.
- `k` is an integer.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `k` is not equal to 1.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **-1**
