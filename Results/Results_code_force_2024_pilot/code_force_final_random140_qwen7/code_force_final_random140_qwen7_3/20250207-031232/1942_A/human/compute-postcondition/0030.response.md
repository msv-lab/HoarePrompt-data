Output State: The values of `n` and `k` will be the integers entered by the user for each test case, and these values will remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final values of `n` and `k` for each test case will be the same as the initial values provided for that test case.

In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop, the values of `n` and `k` will be the same as the values entered by the user for each test case, and these values will not be altered by the loop.
