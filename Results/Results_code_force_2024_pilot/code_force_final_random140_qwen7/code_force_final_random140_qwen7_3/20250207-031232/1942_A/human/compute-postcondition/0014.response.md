Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved in this loop head is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the Postcondition:**
   - The postcondition given is: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) inclusive, and `k` is an integer.
   - If `n` equals `k`, then `n` and `k` are equal. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - If `k` is 1, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition; otherwise, `k` is not equal to 1.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the value of `int(input())` will determine how many times the loop will run.
   - We need to consider the postcondition for the next iteration, which means we need to account for the input value that will be used to control the loop.

Given that the loop will run based on the input value, let's assume the input value for the next iteration is `m`.

- If `m` is 1, the loop will run once.
- If `m` is greater than 1, the loop will run `m` times.

Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on the input value `m`.

4. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The new state will include the updated values of `n` and `k` based on the input `m`.
   - If `m` is 1, `n` and `k` remain the same.
   - If `m` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` will be updated according to the postcondition.

Since the exact value of `m` is not provided, we can represent the state in a general form:

**State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) inclusive, and `k` is an integer. If `n` equals `k`, then `n` and `k` are equal. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and if `k` is 1, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition; otherwise, `k` is not equal to 1. The loop will run `m` times where `m` is the input value for the next iteration.**
