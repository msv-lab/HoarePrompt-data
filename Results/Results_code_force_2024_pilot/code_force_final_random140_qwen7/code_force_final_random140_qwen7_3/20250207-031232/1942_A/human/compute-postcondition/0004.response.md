Given the initial state where `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) inclusive and `k` is an integer such that `n == k`, the code snippet to be analyzed is:

```python
print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` function:

1. `('1 ' * n)` creates a string consisting of `n` repetitions of the substring `'1 '` (a space after each '1').
2. `[:-1]` slices the string to remove the last character, which is a space.

Therefore, the string generated will be `n-1` occurrences of '1 ' followed by no trailing space.

For example, if `n` is 5, the string would be `'1 1 1 1 1'`.

So, the `print` statement will output a string of `n-1` ones separated by spaces.

Output: **'1 ' * (n-1)**
