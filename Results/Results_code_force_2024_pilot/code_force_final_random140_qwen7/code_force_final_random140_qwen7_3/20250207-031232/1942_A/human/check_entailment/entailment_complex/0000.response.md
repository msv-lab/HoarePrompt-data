Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and constraints.
2. It processes each test case independently, ensuring that the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged after each iteration.
3. The logic for determining the output based on the relationship between `n` and `k` is as follows:
   - If `n == k`, it prints a sequence of `n` ones, which ensures that every cyclic shift is sorted.
   - If `k == 1`, it prints a sequence of integers starting from 2 up to `n+1`. This ensures that only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid array exists.
4. The program does not alter the values of `n` and `k` after processing all test cases, maintaining consistency with the problem statement.
5. The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
