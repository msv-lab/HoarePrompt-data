Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not generate arrays that meet the requirement of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for all test cases. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - For `n == k`, the program prints `1 1 ... 1` (n times), which is correct because all cyclic shifts will be sorted.
   - For `k == 1`, the program prints a sequence `1 2 3 ... n`, which is also correct because only the first cyclic shift will be sorted.
   - However, for other values of `n` and `k`, the program always prints `-1`, which is incorrect. The problem statement allows for more complex solutions where `k` sorted cyclic shifts can be achieved without printing `-1`.

2. **Example Counter-Case**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 3` and `k = 2`. According to the problem, we need an array with exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts. One possible solution is `[1, 3, 2]`:
     - Cyclic shifts: `[1, 3, 2]` (not sorted)
     - Cyclic shifts: `[3, 2, 1]` (sorted)
     - Cyclic shifts: `[2, 1, 3]` (not sorted)
   - This array has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts, but the program incorrectly prints `-1`.

Since the program fails to generate valid arrays for certain test cases (like `n = 3` and `k = 2`), it does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
