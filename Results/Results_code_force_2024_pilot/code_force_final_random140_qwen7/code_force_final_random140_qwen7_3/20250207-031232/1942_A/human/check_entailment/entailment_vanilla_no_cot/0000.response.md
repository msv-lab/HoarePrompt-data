Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all test cases according to the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Case where `n != k` and `k > 1`:**
   - The solution only handles the cases where `n == k` or `k == 1`. For other cases, it prints `-1`, which is incorrect.
   - According to the problem, if `n != k` and `k > 1`, there should be no valid array, so the solution should indeed print `-1`. However, the current implementation fails to handle this correctly for all values of `n` and `k`.

2. **General Case Handling:**
   - The solution does not provide a general approach to generate an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k > 1` and `n != k`.
   - A valid approach would involve constructing an array where certain cyclic shifts are sorted while others are not. This requires more complex logic than what is currently implemented.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        # If k is 1, we can create a simple increasing sequence
        if k == 1:
            print(' '.join(str(i + 1) for i in range(n)))
        # If n == k, we can create a sequence where all cyclic shifts are sorted
        elif n == k:
            print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
        # If k > 1 and n != k, it's impossible to have exactly k sorted cyclic shifts
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This solution correctly handles all cases as per the problem statement.
