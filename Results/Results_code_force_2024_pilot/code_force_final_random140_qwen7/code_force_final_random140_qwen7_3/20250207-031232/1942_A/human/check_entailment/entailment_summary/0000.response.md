Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case where \( n = k \). In this scenario, it prints a sequence of \( n \) ones, which ensures that every cyclic shift is sorted.
2. The program also correctly handles the case where \( k = 1 \). It prints a sequence of integers starting from 2 up to \( n+1 \), ensuring that only one specific cyclic shift is sorted. This is achieved by making sure that the smallest element (2) is at the end of the array, and the rest are in increasing order.
3. However, the program incorrectly handles other cases. Specifically, it always prints -1 when neither \( n = k \) nor \( k = 1 \). According to the problem statement, we need to check if there exists an array with exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. The provided solution does not explore all possibilities and fails to generate arrays for other valid \( n \) and \( k \) pairs.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all valid test cases.

Correctness: **False**
