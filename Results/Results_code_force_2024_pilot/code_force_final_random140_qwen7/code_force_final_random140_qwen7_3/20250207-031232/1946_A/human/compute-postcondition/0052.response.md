Output State: **`i` equals `n`, `n` is an input integer, all elements in the list `a` are sorted integers and are less than or equal to `median`, and `t` must be greater than 1; `median` is `a[n // 2]; median_index` is `n // 2; operations` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `operations` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `median`, `median_index`, or `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
