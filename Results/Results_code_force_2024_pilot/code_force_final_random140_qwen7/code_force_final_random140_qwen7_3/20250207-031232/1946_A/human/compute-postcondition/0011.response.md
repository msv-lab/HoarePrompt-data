Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of `a[p]` in the sublist `a[p:]`, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new state of `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.
