Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, the value of `a[i]` is updated to be less than the median, and `operations` is increased by the difference between `median` and the original value of `a[i]`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the if part, where `operations` is now `operations + (median - a[i])`.
