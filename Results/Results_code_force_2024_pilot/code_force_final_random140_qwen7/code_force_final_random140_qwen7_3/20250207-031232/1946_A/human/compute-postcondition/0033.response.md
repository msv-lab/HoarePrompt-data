Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, operations is increased by `median - a[i]`, the current value of `a[i]` is less than the median**

Explanation: The line `operations += median - a[i]` increases the value of `operations` by the difference between `median` and the current value of `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is less than the median, `median - a[i]` will be a positive value. The conditions and values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
