Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- All elements in the list `a` are sorted integers and are less than or equal to `median`.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `median` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `a`.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[i])` for all `i` in the range of `n` where `a[i] < median`.

The `print(operations)` statement will print the value of `operations`, which is the sum of the differences between `median` and each element in the list `a` that is less than `median`.

Output: **the sum of (median - a[i]) for all i in the range of n where a[i] < median**
