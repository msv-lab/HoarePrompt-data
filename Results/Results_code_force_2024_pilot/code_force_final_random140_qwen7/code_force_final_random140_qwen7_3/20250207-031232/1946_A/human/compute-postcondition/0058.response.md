Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - All elements in the list `a` are sorted integers and are less than or equal to `median`.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `median` is `a[n // 2]`.
   - `median_index` is `n // 2`.
   - `operations` is either `median - a[0]` if `a[i] < median` is true, or remains `median - a[0]` if `a[i] < median` is false.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(n)`, the next value of `i` will be `1` (since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration).
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop itself, so it remains the same as the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still needs to be greater than `0`.

6. **Post-Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` must be `1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `0`.
   - The conditions for `a`, `t`, `median`, `median_index`, and `operations` remain the same as they are not affected by the loop incrementing `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, all elements in the list `a` are sorted integers and are less than or equal to `median`, `t` must be greater than 1, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, and `operations` is either `median - a[0]` if `a[i] < median` is true, or remains `median - a[0]` if `a[i] < median` is false.**
