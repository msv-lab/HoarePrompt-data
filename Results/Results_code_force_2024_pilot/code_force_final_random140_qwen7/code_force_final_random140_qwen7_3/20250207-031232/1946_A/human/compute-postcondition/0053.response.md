Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
   - The variable `i` will take on values from 0 to `n-1` during each iteration.

3. **Adjust the given states**:
   - The initial value of `i` is given as `i` equals `n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The value of `i` should be adjusted to start from 0, which is the default starting point for the `range` function.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states such that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` starts from 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, all elements in the list `a` are sorted integers and are less than or equal to `median`, and `t` must be greater than 1; `median` is `a[n // 2]; median_index` is `n // 2; operations` is 0**
