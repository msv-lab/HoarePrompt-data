Based on the initial state provided:

- All elements in the list `a` are less than or equal to `median`.
- The variable `i` equals `n`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- The variable `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[i])` for all `i` where `a[i]` was originally greater than `median`.

Given that all elements in the list `a` are less than or equal to `median`, there are no elements in `a` that were originally greater than `median`. Therefore, the expression `(median - a[i])` will never be evaluated for any `i`, because there are no such elements.

Thus, the value of `operations` remains 0.

Output: **0**
