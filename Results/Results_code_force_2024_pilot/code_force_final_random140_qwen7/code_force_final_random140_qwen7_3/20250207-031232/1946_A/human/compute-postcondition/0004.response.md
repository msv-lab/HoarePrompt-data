Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
