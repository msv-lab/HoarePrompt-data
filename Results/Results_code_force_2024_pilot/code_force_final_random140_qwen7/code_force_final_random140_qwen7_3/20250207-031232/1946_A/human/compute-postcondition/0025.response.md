Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (representing the number of test cases), an integer `n` (representing the length of the array `a`), and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function does not return a specific value but processes each test case according to the given constraints and relationships.**

This means the function handles multiple test cases, each involving an array of integers, and processes them based on the specified conditions without returning a single value outside of its internal logic.
