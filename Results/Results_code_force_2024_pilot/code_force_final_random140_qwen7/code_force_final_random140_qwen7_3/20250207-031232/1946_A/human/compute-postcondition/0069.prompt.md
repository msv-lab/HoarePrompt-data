Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    median_index = n // 2
    median = a[median_index]
    operations = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < median:
            operations += median - a[i]
    print(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `operations` is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i] < median`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements in the list `a` are less than or equal to `median`, and `i` equals `n`. The variable `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[i])` for all `i` where `a[i]` was originally greater than `median`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, all elements in the list `a` are sorted integers and are less than or equal to `median`, and `t` must be greater than 1; `median` is `a[n // 2]`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[i])` for all `i` in the range of `n` where `a[i] < median`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `operations` will hold the total difference between `median` and each element in the list `a` that is less than `median`. The other variables such as `i`, `n`, `a`, `t`, `median`, `median_index` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
