Output State: **`operations` is increased by `median - a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `operations += median - a[i]` updates the value of `operations` by adding `median - a[i]` to its current value. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `i` is still `i + 1` and `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.
