Output State: **`i` equals `n`, `n` is an input integer, all elements in the list `a` are sorted integers and are less than or equal to `median`, and `t` must be greater than 1; `median_index` is `n // 2`.**

The code calculates the index of the median element in the list `a` using the formula `median_index = n // 2`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `t`, or the sorted condition of `a`. The value of `median_index` is now determined based on the value of `n`.
