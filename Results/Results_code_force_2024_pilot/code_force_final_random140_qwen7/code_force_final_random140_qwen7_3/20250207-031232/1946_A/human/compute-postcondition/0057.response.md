Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, all elements in the list `a` are sorted integers and are less than or equal to `median`, and `t` must be greater than 1; `median` is `a[n // 2]; median_index` is `n // 2; operations` is either `median - a[0]` if `a[i] < median` is true, or remains `median - a[0]` if `a[i] < median` is false.
