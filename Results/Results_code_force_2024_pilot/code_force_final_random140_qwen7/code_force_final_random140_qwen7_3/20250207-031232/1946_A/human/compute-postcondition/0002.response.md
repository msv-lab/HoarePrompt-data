Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
   - The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.
   - The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop execution directly.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
