Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, all elements in the list `a` are sorted integers and are less than or equal to `median`, `t` must be greater than 1, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, and `operations` is updated to either `operations + (median - a[i])` if `a[i] < median` is true, or remains `operations` if `a[i] < median` is false.
