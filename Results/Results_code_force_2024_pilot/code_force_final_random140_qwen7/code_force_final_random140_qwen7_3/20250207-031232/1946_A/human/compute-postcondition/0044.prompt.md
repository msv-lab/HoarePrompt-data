Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `operations` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] < median:
        operations += median - a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, and the value of `a[i]` is updated to be less than the median. Additionally, the variable `operations` is increased by the difference between `median` and the original value of `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, the value of `a[i]` is updated to be less than the median, and `operations` is increased by the difference between `median` and the original value of `a[i]`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the if part, where `operations` is now `operations + (median - a[i])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`, and `operations` is increased by `median - a[i]` if `a[i]` is less than `median`. If `a[i]` is not less than `median`, the values of `i`, `n`, and `operations` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
