Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This sets `t` as the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `a` remain as part of the initial state, waiting for further input.
