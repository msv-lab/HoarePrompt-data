Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Analyze the postcondition from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
   - The value of `a[i]` is updated to be less than the median.
   - `operations` is increased by the difference between `median` and the original value of `a[i]` (`operations += (median - a[i])`).

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `i + 1` (which is the new value of `i`).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `i + 1` (new value of `i`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
