Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes input through a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. It returns the results of processing each test case.**

This means the function takes no explicit parameters but expects input in a specific structured format (multiple test cases with lengths and arrays of integers) and processes each test case accordingly, returning the results of these processes.
