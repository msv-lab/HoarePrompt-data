Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Median**: The function calculates the count of the middle element in the second half of the sorted array, which is not the correct approach to finding the median. The median should be the element at position `p` in the sorted array, where `p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, or the average of the elements at positions `p` and `p+1` if `n` is even.

2. **Incorrect Objective**: The goal is to increase the median, but the function simply counts how many times the current median appears in the second half of the array. This does not provide the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

3. **No Increment Operations**: The function does not perform any increment operations to change the values in the array. Instead, it only counts occurrences, which is irrelevant to the problem's objective.

Given these issues, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
