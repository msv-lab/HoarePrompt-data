Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it counts how many times the element at the median position appears in the sorted array. This is not equivalent to the problem's requirement.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2 2 8
```

The median of the array `[2, 2, 8]` is `2`. To increase the median to `3`, we only need to increase one of the `2`s to `3`, which requires 1 operation. However, the program will output `1` because it counts the occurrences of `2`, which is correct but does not solve the problem as intended.

Another example is:

```
4
7 3 3 1
```

The median of the array `[1, 3, 3, 7]` is `3`. To increase the median to `4`, we need to increase one of the `3`s to `4`, which requires 1 operation. However, the program will output `2` because it counts the occurrences of `3`, which is again correct but does not solve the problem as intended.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and should be considered incorrect.
