The function processes a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^6, along with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and a series of queries defined by pairs of integers `l` and `r` (where 1 <= l < r <= n). For each query, it prints either the value at index `r` in the list `a` if it meets the condition `a[r] >= l`, otherwise it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.
