Output State: **`q` is `q - 1`, `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` assigns the values returned by the function `R()` to the variables `l` and `r`. Since the function `R()` returns a value each time it is called, `l` and `r` will be assigned new values from `R()`. The value of `q` is decremented by 1 but remains unchanged in terms of its relationship to itself, hence it is represented as `q - 1`. The initial state of `l` and `r` being values returned by `R()` is preserved.
