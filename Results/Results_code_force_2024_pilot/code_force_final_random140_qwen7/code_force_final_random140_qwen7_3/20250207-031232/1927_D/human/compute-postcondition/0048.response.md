Output State: **`p` is equal to `x`, `j` is set to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value; `a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The values of `p`, `j`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `p` is still equal to `x`, `j` is set to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value, and `a` is increased by `j`. Additionally, `i` is now increased by 1.
