Output State: **`p` is equal to `x`, `j` is set to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value; `a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 1.**

This means that `i` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `p`, `j`, and `a` remain as they were initially described, with `j` potentially changing based on the condition `x != p`.
