Output State: **`q` is 0, `l` must be an element returned by `R()`, `r` must be an element returned by `R()`, `t` is False, `a` is [1, (0, 1), 2], `p` is `new_x`, `i` is 2, `j` is (2, 2)**

Explanation: The code `a += j,` adds the tuple `j` (which is `(2, 2)`) to the list `a`. Initially, `a` is `[1, (0, 1)]`. After adding `j`, `a` becomes `[1, (0, 1), 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
