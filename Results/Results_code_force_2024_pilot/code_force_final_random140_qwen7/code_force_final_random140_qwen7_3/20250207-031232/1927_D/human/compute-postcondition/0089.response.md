Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in R()`. This means the loop variable is `x`, and it is being assigned values from the function `R()`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `q` is 0
   - `l` must be an element returned by `R()`
   - `r` must be an element returned by `R()`
   - `t` is False
   - `a` is `[1, (0, 1)]`
   - `p` is `x`
   - `i` is 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, the value of `x` must be obtained from the function `R()`. Since `x` is the loop variable, the value of `x` will change at each iteration.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `q` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` and `r` must be new elements returned by `R()`.
   - `t` remains False as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains `[1, (0, 1)]` as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `p` will now be the new value of `x` because `p` is set to `x` in the loop head.
   - `i` remains 2 as it is not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`q` is 0, `l` must be an element returned by `R()`, `r` must be an element returned by `R()`, `t` is False, `a` is [1, (0, 1)], `p` is `x`, `i` is 2** (with `x` being a new value from `R()`).

However, since `x` is the loop variable and its value changes at each iteration, we need to explicitly state the new value of `x` for the next iteration. Let's denote the new value of `x` as `new_x`.

State: **`q` is 0, `l` must be an element returned by `R()`, `r` must be an element returned by `R()`, `t` is False, `a` is [1, (0, 1)], `p` is `new_x`, `i` is 2**
