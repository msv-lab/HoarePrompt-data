Output State: **`t` is now the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2*10^5, `R` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into a tuple of integers.**

The code `t, = R()` assigns the first element of the tuple returned by the lambda function `R()` to the variable `t`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `q`, and `R`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
