Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in R()`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x`.

2. **Understand the Iteration Context**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
   - `t` is a non-zero value
   - `a` is a list containing the elements `[0, 0]`
   - `p` is the value of `x`
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 0

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as there are values available from `R()`. Since `x` is being iterated over, the loop will continue if `R()` provides a new value for `x`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must receive a new value from `R()`. This means that `p` (which was the value of `x` in the previous iteration) will change to the next value provided by `R()`. 

5. **Update the States**:
   - `t` remains a non-zero value since it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `a` remains `[0, 0]` since it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `p` will now be the next value provided by `R()`.
   - `i` remains 1 since it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `j` remains 0 since it is not directly affected by the loop.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`t` is a non-zero value, `a` is a list containing the elements [0, 0], `p` is the next value provided by `R()`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
