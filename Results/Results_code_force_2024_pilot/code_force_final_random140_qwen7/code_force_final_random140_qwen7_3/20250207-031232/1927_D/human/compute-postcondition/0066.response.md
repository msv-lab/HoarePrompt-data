Output State: **`q` is now `q - 1`, `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`**

Explanation: The value of `q` is decremented by 1, making it `q - 1`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged as they are assigned the result of the function `R()` which is not affected by the operation on `q`.
