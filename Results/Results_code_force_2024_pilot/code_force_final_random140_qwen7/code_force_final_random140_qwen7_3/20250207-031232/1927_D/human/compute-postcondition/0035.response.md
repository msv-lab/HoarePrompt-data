Output State: **`q` is 0, `l` is a value returned by R(), `r` is a value returned by R()**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` assigns the values returned by the function `R()` to the variables `l` and `r`. Since the initial state shows that `l` and `r` are values returned by `R()`, and `q` remains unchanged, the output state reflects that `q` is still 0, while `l` and `r` are updated to the new values returned by `R()`.
