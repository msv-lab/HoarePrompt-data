Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is set to `q - 1`. This means `q` is one less than its original value.
   - `l` is a value returned by `R()`. Since `R()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`, but we know it is a value returned by `R()`.
   - `r` is a value returned by `R()`. Similarly, we do not know the exact value of `r`, but we know it is a value returned by `R()`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

   Let's analyze this line by line:
   - `a[r]` refers to the element in the list `a` at index `r`.
   - We need to evaluate the condition `a[r] < l`. If this condition is true, the expression evaluates to `(a[r], r)`. Otherwise, it evaluates to `[-1] * 2`, which is a list with two `-1`s.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the tuple or list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

Given the initial state, we can summarize the possible outputs:

- If `a[r] < l` is true, then the print statement will output `a[r]` followed by `r`.
- If `a[r] < l` is false, then the print statement will output `-1, -1`.

Since we don't have the exact values of `a`, `r`, and `l`, we can only describe the output in terms of the conditions.

Output: **a[r], r if a[r] < l, otherwise -1, -1 (where a[r] is the element in list a at index r, r is a value returned by R(), and l is a value returned by R())**
