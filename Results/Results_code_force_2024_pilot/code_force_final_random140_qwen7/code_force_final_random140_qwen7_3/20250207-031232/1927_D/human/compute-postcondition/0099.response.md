Output State: **`q` is False, `l` is an element returned by `R()`, `r` is an element returned by `R()`, `t` is False, `a` is [1, (0, 1), 2, 3, 4, ...], `p` is the last element returned by `R()` during the loop execution, `i` is the total number of iterations performed by the loop, `j` is `(i-1, i-1)`, `x` is the current element returned by `R()` in the last iteration.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` assigns the first element returned by `R()` to `l` and the second element returned by `R()` to `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
