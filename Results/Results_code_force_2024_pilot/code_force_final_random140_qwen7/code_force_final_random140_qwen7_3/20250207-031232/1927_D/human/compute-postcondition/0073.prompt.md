Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is equal to the value returned by `R()`, `j` is set to `i` if the last value of `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value; `a` is a list containing the sum of all `j` values added during each iteration, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations which is also the number of times `R()` was called, `p` is equal to the last value returned by `R()`, `j` is set to `i` if the last value of `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value, `a` is a list of all `j` values added during each iteration, `i` is the total number of iterations, `q` retains its initial value, `l` retains its initial value, `r` retains its initial value, `t` remains false.
Code of the loop:
while q:
    q -= 1
    l, r = R()
    print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is `q - 1`; `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `q` is `q - 1`, `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `q` is decreased by 1, `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
