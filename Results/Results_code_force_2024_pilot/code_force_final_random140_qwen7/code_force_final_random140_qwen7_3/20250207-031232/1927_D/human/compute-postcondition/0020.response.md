Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value, `a` is a list containing the elements [0, 1, (j, i)[x != p]], `p` is the next value of `x` generated by `R()`, `i` is 2, `j` is (j, i)[x != p], `x` is equal to `p`.**

Explanation: The code `p = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `p`. Since `x` is the next value generated by `R()`, `p` now holds this value. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
