Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value, `a` is a list containing the elements [0, 1, (j, i)[x != p]], `p` is the next value of `x` generated by `R()`, `i` is 2, `j` is (j, i)[x != p]**.

Explanation: The code `a += j,` appends the value of `j` to the list `a`. Since `j` is defined as `(j, i)[x != p]`, it means that `j` will take the value of `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise, it will remain as `j`. The values of `t`, `p`, `i`, and the original `a` are not affected by this operation.
