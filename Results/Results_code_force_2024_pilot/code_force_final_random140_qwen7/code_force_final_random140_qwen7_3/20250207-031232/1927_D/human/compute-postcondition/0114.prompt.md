You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2*10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        R()
        
        a = [0]
        
        p = i = j = 0
        
        for x in R():
            j = (j, i)[x != p]
            a += j,
            p = x
            i += 1
        
        q, = R()
        
        while q:
            q -= 1
            l, r = R()
            print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
        
    #State: Output State: `q` is `False`; `l` is an element returned by `R()`, `r` is an element returned by `R()`, `t` is `False`, `a` is a list starting with `[1, 0]` followed by a sequence of integers where each integer represents the cumulative count of elements processed so far, `p` is the last element returned by `R()` during the loop execution, `i` is the total number of iterations performed by the loop, `j` is `(i-1, i-1)`, `x` is the last element returned by `R()` during the loop execution.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` becomes `False` because the `while t:` condition is initially true and `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `False`. The variable `q` also becomes `False` because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the inner `while q:` loop and eventually reaches `False`. The values of `l` and `r` will be the last values returned by the function `R()` during the loop's final iteration. The list `a` will contain the cumulative counts of elements processed, starting with `[1, 0]` and continuing with a sequence of integers representing the cumulative count. The variables `p`, `i`, `j`, and `x` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^6, along with two integers `t`, `q`, and a series of queries defined by pairs of integers `l` and `r` (where 1 <= l < r <= n). For each query, it returns a result based on the specified range within the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
