Output State: **`q` is 0, `l` is a value returned by R(), `r` is a value returned by R(), `t` is False**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` must be initially True, decrementing it results in `t` becoming False. The values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
