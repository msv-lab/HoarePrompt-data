Output State: **`q` is a non-zero value - 1, `l` is a value returned by R(), `r` is a value returned by R()**

Explanation: The value of `q` is decremented by 1. Since `q` was initially a non-zero value, after the operation, `q` becomes a non-zero value - 1. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged as they were assigned values from the function `R()` and are not affected by the operation on `q`.
