Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is 1 less than the original value returned by `R()`.**

Explanation: The initial state specifies that `t` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()` and must be non-zero. The code `t -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `t`. Since `t` was originally a non-zero value, after executing the code, `t` will be that original value minus 1, which is still a non-zero value.
