Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `while q:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `q` is truthy (non-zero).

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `q` is 0.
   - `l` is a value returned by `R()`.
   - `r` is a value returned by `R()`.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: Since the loop condition is based on `q`, and `q` is currently 0, we need to change the state of `q` to a non-zero value for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to set `q` to a non-zero value. Since `q` is currently 0, we can set it to any non-zero value, such as 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `q` to a non-zero value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`q` is a non-zero value, `l` is a value returned by R(), `r` is a value returned by R()**
