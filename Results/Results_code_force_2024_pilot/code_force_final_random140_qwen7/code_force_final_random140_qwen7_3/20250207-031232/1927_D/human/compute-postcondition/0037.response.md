Output State: `q` is 0; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R().

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `q` is non-zero. Since `q` is initially set to a non-zero value and it decreases by 1 with each iteration, eventually `q` will reach 0. Once `q` becomes 0, the loop condition (`q:`) fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, regardless of how many times the loop has executed, the final state of `q` will be 0, and `l` and `r` will hold the values returned by the function `R()` during the last iteration of the loop.
