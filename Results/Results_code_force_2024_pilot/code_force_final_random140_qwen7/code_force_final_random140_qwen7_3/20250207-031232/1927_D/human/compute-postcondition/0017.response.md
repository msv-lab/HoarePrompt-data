Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in R()`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `R()`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is a non-zero value.
   - `a` is a list containing the elements `[0, 1]`.
   - `p` is the value of `x`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `(0, 1)[x != p]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `x` is in the range `R()`. Since the exact nature of `R()` is not specified, we assume it is a function that generates a sequence of values for `x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `x` will change in the next iteration because the loop is iterating over `R()`.
   - The variable `p` will also change since it is dependent on the value of `x`.
   - The variable `j` will change based on the new value of `x` and the old value of `p`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `x` will be the next value generated by `R()`.
   - `p` will be the value of `x` in the next iteration.
   - `j` will be `(0, 1)[x != p]` based on the new value of `x`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is a non-zero value, `a` is a list containing the elements [0, 1], `p` is the next value of `x` generated by `R()`, `i` is 2, `j` is `(0, 1)[x != p]`**
