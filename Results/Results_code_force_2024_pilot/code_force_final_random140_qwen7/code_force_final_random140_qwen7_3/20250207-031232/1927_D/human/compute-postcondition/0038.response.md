Output State: `q` is 0; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R().

**Natural Language Explanation:** After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `q` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration and starts from a non-zero value that is reduced to 0 after 3 iterations. The values of `l` and `r` will be the last values returned by the function `R()` during the loop's final iteration.
