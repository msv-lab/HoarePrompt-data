Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^6, along with two integers `t`, `q`, and a series of queries defined by pairs of integers `l` and `r` (where 1 <= l < r <= n). For each query, it returns a result based on the specified range within the list `a`.**
