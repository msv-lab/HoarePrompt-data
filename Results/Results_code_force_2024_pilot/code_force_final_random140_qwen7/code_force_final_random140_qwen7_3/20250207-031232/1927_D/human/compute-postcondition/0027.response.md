Output State: **`q` is 0; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R().**

In this scenario, the code `l, r = R()` calls the function `R()`, which returns two values. These values are assigned to `l` and `r` respectively. The initial value of `q` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `l` and `r` as the results of the function call, while `q` retains its original value.
