Output State: **`p` is equal to the next value of `x` from `R()`, `j` is set to `i` if the next value of `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value, `a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `a += j` increments the value of `a` by `j`. The value of `j` is determined by the condition `j = i if x != p else j`, which means if the next value of `x` from `R()` is not equal to `p`, then `j` is set to `i`; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged. Since the exact values of `x`, `p`, and `i` are not specified, we keep them in their general form. The output state reflects that `a` has been updated by adding `j`, and `i` has been incremented by 1.
