Output State: **`p` is equal to `x`, `j` is set to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value; `a` is increased by `j`.**

Explanation: The code `p = x` simply assigns the current value of `x` to `p`. This does not affect the value of `j` or `a`. The condition for setting `j` to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p` remains the same as before the assignment, because `p` is now equal to `x`. Therefore, the value of `j` will remain unchanged unless `x` changes in a subsequent line of code. The value of `a` is increased by `j`, but since `j` is unchanged, `a` is increased by its original value of `j`.
