Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `q` is a non-zero value, but its specific value is not important for this particular print statement.
   - `l` is a value returned by `R()`. Since the function `R()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.
   - `r` is a value returned by `R()`. Similarly, since the function `R()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `r`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

   - The expression `a[r]` refers to the element in a list `a` at index `r`. However, the list `a` is not defined in the initial state.
   - The expression `a[r] < l` checks if the element at index `r` in list `a` is less than `l`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, then the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)` is used. This results in a tuple where the first element is `(a[r], r)` and the second element is a list of two `-1`s.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, then the expression `[-1] * 2` is used, resulting in a list of two `-1`s.

Given the lack of specific values for `a`, `l`, and `r`, we need to consider the general case. Since `a[r]` is not explicitly defined, we can only describe it in terms of `l` and `r`.

- If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the print statement will output `(a[r], r), -1, -1`.
- If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the print statement will output `-1, -1`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(a[r], r), -1, -1** if `a[r] < l` is `True`, otherwise **-1, -1**
