Output State: **`q` is `q - 1`; `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `q` is `q - 1`. The code `l, r = R()` calls the function `R()` which returns two values. These returned values are assigned to `l` and `r`. Since the exact values returned by `R()` are not specified, they are represented as the values returned by `R()`. The value of `q` remains as `q - 1` from the initial state.
