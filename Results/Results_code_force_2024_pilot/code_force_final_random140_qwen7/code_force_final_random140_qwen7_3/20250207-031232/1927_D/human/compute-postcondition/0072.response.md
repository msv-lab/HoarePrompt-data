Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `q` is decreased by 1. This means `q` is now one less than its original value, but since the value of `q` itself is not relevant to the print statement, we can ignore it.
   - `l` is a value returned by `R()`. Since `R()` is a function whose behavior is not specified, we will denote the value it returns as `l`.
   - `r` is a value returned by `R()`. Similarly, the value returned by `R()` is denoted as `r`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement**:
   - `a[r]` refers to the element at index `r` in a list named `a`. However, the list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `a[r]`.
   - `[-1] * 2` creates a list with two `-1`s: `[-1, -1]`.
   - The expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` checks if `a[r]` is less than `l`. If true, it selects the tuple `(a[r], r)`, otherwise, it selects the list `[-1, -1]`.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the selected tuple or list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

4. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `a[r] < l` is true, the print statement will output `a[r]` followed by `r`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is false, the print statement will output `-1` twice.

Since we don't have the exact value of `a[r]` or `l`, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the conditions.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l, otherwise -1 -1**
