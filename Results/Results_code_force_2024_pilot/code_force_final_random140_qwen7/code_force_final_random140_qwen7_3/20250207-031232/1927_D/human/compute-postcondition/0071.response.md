Output State: **`q` is decreased by 1, `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` calls the function `R()` twice and assigns the returned values to `l` and `r` respectively. The value of `q` is already decreased by 1 before this line of code, so it remains decreased by 1. The values of `l` and `r` are updated to the new values returned by `R()`.
