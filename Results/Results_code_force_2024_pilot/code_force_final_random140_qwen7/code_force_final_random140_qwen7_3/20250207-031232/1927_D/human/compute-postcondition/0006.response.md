Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is 1 less than the original value returned by `R()`, `a` is a list containing the single element 0, `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes three new variables `p`, `i`, and `j` to 0. The initial values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
