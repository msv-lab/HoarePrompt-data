Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: The program only checks if `a[r] >= l` for each query and prints `a[r]` if true, otherwise `-1`. However, the problem requires finding two distinct indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. The current implementation does not ensure that `i` and `j` are distinct or even exist within the queried range.

2. **Misunderstanding of the Problem Requirements**: The program does not maintain information about distinct elements within the queried range. It only uses a single variable `p` to track the last seen element and updates another variable `j` based on whether the current element matches `p`. This approach does not help in identifying distinct elements within the range `[l, r]`.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs a single value or `-1` for each query without providing two distinct indices as required by the problem statement.

Given these issues, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
