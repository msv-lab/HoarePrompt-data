You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2*10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.

    #State: Output State: `q` is `False`; `l` is an element returned by `R()`, `r` is an element returned by `R()`, `t` is `False`, `a` is a list starting with `[1, 0]` followed by a sequence of integers where each integer represents the cumulative count of elements processed so far, `p` is the last element returned by `R()` during the loop execution, `i` is the total number of iterations performed by the loop, `j` is `(i-1, i-1)`, `x` is the last element returned by `R()` during the loop execution.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` becomes `False` because the `while t:` condition is initially true and `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `False`. The variable `q` also becomes `False` because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the inner `while q:` loop and eventually reaches `False`. The values of `l` and `r` will be the last values returned by the function `R()` during the loop's final iteration. The list `a` will contain the cumulative counts of elements processed, starting with `[1, 0]` and continuing with a sequence of integers representing the cumulative count. The variables `p`, `i`, `j`, and `x` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^6, along with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and a series of queries defined by pairs of integers `l` and `r` (where 1 <= l < r <= n). For each query, it prints either the value at index `r` in the list `a` if it meets the condition `a[r] >= l`, otherwise it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to find a pair of different elements within the queried range for certain inputs.

Consider the following example:

- Input:
```
5
2
1 2
1
1 2
```

- Expected Output:
```
1 2
```

- Actual Output:
```
-1 -1
```

The program incorrectly returns `-1 -1` because it does not properly track the indices of the elements within the queried range. The program uses a single index `i` to keep track of the last seen element's position, but it does not ensure that the indices `i` and `j` fall within the queried range `[l, r]`.

To fix this, the program needs to maintain a separate index for the start of the current subarray being considered and ensure that the indices `i` and `j` are within the bounds of the query. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    from collections import defaultdict

    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = next(R())
        a = list(R())
        q = next(R())
        queries = [tuple(R()) for _ in range(q)]

        results = []
        for l, r in queries:
            i, j = l, l
            found = False
            for k in range(l, r):
                if a[k] != a[i]:
                    j = k
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                results.append((i, j))
            else:
                results.append((-1, -1))

        for res in results:
            print(*res)
        if t > 0:
            print()  # Separate outputs for different test cases

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each query, it finds the first pair of different elements within the range `[l, r]` and prints their indices. If no such pair exists, it prints `-1 -1`.
