Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**: The array `a` is sorted and then reversed. Sorting helps in easily identifying the smallest elements, and reversing makes it easier to consider the largest elements first.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The initial sum of the array (`sum1`) is calculated correctly.

4. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `k` inclusive.
   - For each iteration, the program calculates a new sum (`sums`) based on the current value of `i`.
   - The logic inside the loop is designed to handle different scenarios based on the value of `i` and the condition `i + x - 1 < n`.
   - The program updates the `sums` value by considering the removal of elements by Alice and the negation of elements by Bob.
   - The final result is the maximum value among all the intermediate sums calculated during the loop iterations.

5. **Output**: The program prints the maximum value found in the list `ans`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob and calculate the final sum of the array elements after their moves.

Correctness: **True**
