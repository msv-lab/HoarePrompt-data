Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation. The list `a` is updated to its sorted version.
