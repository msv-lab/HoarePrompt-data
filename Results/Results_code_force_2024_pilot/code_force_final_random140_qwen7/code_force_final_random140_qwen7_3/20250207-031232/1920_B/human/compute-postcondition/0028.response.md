Output State: **`sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]` from the current value of `sums`. The initial values of `sums` and `a` are not specified, but the operation performed on them is clear. Therefore, the new value of `sums` is the old value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]` minus `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
