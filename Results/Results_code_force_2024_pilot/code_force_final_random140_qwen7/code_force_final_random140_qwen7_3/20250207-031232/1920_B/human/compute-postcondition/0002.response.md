Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
