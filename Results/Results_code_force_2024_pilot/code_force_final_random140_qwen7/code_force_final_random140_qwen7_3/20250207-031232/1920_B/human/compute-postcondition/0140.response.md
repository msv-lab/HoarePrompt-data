Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i == 0`, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and `ans` is a list with one element `sums`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` is a list with one additional element which is `sums`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`.
