Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `a[0]`**

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding the value of `a[i-1]` to it. Given that `i` is initially 1, `i-1` equals 0. Therefore, `sums` is updated to be the value of `a[0]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
