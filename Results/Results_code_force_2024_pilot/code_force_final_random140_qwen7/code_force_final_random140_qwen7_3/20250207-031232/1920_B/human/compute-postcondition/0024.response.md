Postcondition: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is a list. If `i` equals 0, then `ans` contains the value of `sum1`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` contains the value of `a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]` and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` contains the value of `a[1]` and `i` is 2.**
