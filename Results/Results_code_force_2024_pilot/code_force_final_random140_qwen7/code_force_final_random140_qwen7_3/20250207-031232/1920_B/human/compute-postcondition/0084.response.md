Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` to be the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The expression `sum(a[:x + 1])` calculates the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of the list `a`, and this result is multiplied by 2 and subtracted from `sum1`. The updated value of `sums` is dependent on the values of `sum1`, `a`, and `x`.
