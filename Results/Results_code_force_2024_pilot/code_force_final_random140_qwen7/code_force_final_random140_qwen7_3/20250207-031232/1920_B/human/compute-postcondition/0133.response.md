Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to the current value of `sums`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The exact value of `sums` depends on the values of `a[i - 1]` and `a[i + x - 1]`, which are not specified in the initial state.
