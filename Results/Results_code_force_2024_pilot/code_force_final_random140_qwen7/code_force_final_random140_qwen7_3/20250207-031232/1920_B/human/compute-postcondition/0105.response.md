Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is initially set to 0 and remains unchanged. The variable `k` is mentioned to be a non-negative integer, which also remains unchanged. The new variable `sums` is assigned the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. The other variables `sum1` and `a` are not defined in the initial state, so their values are not specified. The value of `x` is also not defined, but it is used in the calculation of `sums`.
