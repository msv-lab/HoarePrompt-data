Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list since no iterations have occurred yet, `sum1` is now the sum of all elements in the original list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `sum1 = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `sum1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
