Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), each test case consists of n, k, and x where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq x, k \leq n\), and an array of n integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations will be as follows: `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values calculated by the loop for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = k`. 

The final state of `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements, where:
- The first element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- For each subsequent element (from index 1 to `k`), the value is determined by either adding `a[i - 1]` to the previous value of `sums` or subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]` from it, depending on whether `i + x - 1 < n` holds true. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, then only `a[i - 1]` is added to `sums`.

The variable `sums` is updated within the loop for each iteration, and `ans` accumulates these updated values. After the loop completes, `ans` will contain the sequence of sums calculated according to the given conditions for each iteration of `i` from `0` to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` will be updated based on the loop conditions for each iteration from `0` to `k`. The variable `ans` will contain a list of `k + 1` elements, where each element represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. Specifically, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i == 0`, and for subsequent iterations, it is updated as follows: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. Each updated value of `sums` is appended to the list `ans`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `ans` will be a list of length `k + 1`, containing the intermediate values of `sums` calculated during each iteration of the loop, starting from the initial value and updating according to the specified conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
