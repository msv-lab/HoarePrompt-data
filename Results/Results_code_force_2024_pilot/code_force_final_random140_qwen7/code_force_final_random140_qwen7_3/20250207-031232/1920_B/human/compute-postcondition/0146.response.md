Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer \(t\), and for each test case within \(t\), it takes \(n\), \(k\), and \(x\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq x, k \leq n\)), and an array of \(n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) (where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\)). It returns a result based on the specified conditions for each test case.**

This means the function handles multiple test cases defined by \(t\). For each test case, it processes \(n\), \(k\), \(x\), and an array of integers \(a\), and returns a specific result based on the given conditions.
