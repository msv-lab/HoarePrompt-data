Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `ans` contains the value `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is already defined in the initial state as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, it adds this value to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `sums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
