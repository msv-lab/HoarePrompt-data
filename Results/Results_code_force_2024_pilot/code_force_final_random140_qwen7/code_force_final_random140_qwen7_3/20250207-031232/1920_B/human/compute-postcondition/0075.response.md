Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[0]` since `i` is 1) and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]` (which is `a[x]`). The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
