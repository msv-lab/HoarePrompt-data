Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `a[0]`, `ans` contains `[sums]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given that `sums` is initially equal to `a[0]`, after executing `ans.append(sums)`, the list `ans` will contain the element `[sums]`, which is `[a[0]]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
