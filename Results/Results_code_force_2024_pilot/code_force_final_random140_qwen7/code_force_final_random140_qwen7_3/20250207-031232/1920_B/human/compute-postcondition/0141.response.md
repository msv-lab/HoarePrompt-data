Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` will be updated based on the given conditions for each iteration from 0 to `k`. The variable `ans` will be a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.

To summarize, `ans` will contain the sequence of `sums` values calculated for each iteration of the loop from 0 to `k`.
