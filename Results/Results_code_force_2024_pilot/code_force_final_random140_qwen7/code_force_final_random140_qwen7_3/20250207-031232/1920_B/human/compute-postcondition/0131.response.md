Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` to the variable `sums`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The expression `sum(a[:x + 1])` calculates the sum of the slice of list `a` from index 0 to index `x + 1`. The value of `sums` depends on the values of `sum1`, the list `a`, and the value of `x`.
