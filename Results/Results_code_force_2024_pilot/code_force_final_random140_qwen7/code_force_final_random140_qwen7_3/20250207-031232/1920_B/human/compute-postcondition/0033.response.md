Postcondition: `i`, `x`, `n`, `ans`, and `sums` are as follows: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` contains the value of `sums`, which is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, then `ans` now contains `sums + a[i - 1]`, and `sums` is equal to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
