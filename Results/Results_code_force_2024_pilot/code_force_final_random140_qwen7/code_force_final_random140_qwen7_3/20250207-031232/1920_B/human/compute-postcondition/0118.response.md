Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k`.

3. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.
   - `sums` is updated based on certain conditions.
   - `ans` is a list containing the updated `sums`.

4. **Analyze the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `k + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_end`), and `k` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the States**:
   - Since `i` was `i_end` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.
   - `k` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `k` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `i_end + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated according to the rules mentioned, and `ans` is a list containing the updated `sums`.**

To provide a concrete example, if `i_end` was 2 and `k` was 5, the new state would be:

**State: `i` is 3, `k` is 5, `sums` is updated according to the rules mentioned, and `ans` is a list containing the updated `sums`.**
