Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is a non-negative integer. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and `ans` is a list with one additional element which is `sums`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, and `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`.
