Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers entered by the user, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a` in-place. This means the original list `a` is modified to be its reverse. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the operation.
