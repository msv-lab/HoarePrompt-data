Output State: **`sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `k + 1` must be greater than 0.**

This means that the variable `sums` has been updated to the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial conditions.
