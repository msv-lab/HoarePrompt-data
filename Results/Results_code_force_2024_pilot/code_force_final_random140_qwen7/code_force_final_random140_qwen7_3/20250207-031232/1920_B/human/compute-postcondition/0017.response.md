Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]`, `i` is 3, `sums` is `a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given that `sums` is defined as `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `i` is 3, `sums` simplifies to `a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]`. Since `ans` was initially an empty list, after appending `sums`, `ans` now contains this single value. All other variables remain unchanged.
