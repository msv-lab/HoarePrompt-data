Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is a list. If `i` equals 0, then `ans` contains the value of `sum1`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` contains the value of `a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]` and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` contains the value of `a[1]` and `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i`, `x`, `n`, `ans`, and `sums` are as follows: if `i == 0`, then `ans` contains the value of `sums`, which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` contains the value of `sums`, which is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, then `ans` now contains `sums + a[i - 1]`, and `sums` is equal to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing either the value of `sums` updated based on the conditions for `i = 1 + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` or the value of `sums + a[0]`, and `sums` is updated to either `sums + a[0]` or `sums` updated based on the conditions for `i = 1 + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
