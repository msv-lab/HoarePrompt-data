Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `a`. The initial values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
