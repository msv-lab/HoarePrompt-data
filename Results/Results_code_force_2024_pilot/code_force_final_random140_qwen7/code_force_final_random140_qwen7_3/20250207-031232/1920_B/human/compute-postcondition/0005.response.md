Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `sum1`. Since the initial values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` are unchanged, they remain the same. The new variable `sum1` is created and holds the sum of the elements in `a`.
