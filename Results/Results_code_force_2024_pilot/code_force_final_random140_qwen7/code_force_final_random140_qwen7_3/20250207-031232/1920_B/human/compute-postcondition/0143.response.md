Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `i` starts at 0 and will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k + 1`.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.
   - `sums` is updated based on the loop conditions.
   - `ans` is a list that collects the intermediate values of `sums` after each iteration.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For `i = 0`, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
   - For subsequent iterations (`i > 0`), `sums` is updated as follows:
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - After the loop completes, `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration.
   - The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value among these `k + 1` elements.

Given this understanding, the output will be the maximum value found in the list `ans`.

Output: **max value in ans (where ans is a list of k + 1 elements representing the intermediate values of sums after each iteration of the loop)**
