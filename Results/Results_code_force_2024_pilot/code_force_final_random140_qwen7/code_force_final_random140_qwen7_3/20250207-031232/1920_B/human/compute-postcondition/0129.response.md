Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated either to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i == 0`, or to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or to `sums + a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`. `ans` is a list containing one element which is the updated `sums`.
