Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated according to the following rules: if `i` is 0, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and `ans` contains `[sums]`. If `i` is not 0, then `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise `sums` is updated by adding `a[0]`. The final value of `ans` is a list containing the updated `sums`.
