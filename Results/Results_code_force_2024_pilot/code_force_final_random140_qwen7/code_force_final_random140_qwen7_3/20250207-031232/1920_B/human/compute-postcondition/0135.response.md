Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding the element `a[i - 1]` to its current value. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` remains unchanged as it is a non-negative integer. The exact value of `sums` depends on its initial value and the value of `a[i - 1]`, but it is updated to include `a[i - 1]`.
