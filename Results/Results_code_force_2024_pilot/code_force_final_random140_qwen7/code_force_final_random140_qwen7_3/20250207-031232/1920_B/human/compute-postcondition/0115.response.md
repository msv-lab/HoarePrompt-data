Postcondition: `i` is an integer not equal to 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated according to the following rules: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated by adding `a[0]`. The final value of `ans` is a list containing the updated `sums`.
