Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` will be updated based on the loop conditions for each iteration from `0` to `k`. The variable `ans` will contain a list of `k + 1` elements, where each element represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. Specifically, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i == 0`, and for subsequent iterations, it is updated as follows: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. Each updated value of `sums` is appended to the list `ans`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `ans` will be a list of length `k + 1`, containing the intermediate values of `sums` calculated during each iteration of the loop, starting from the initial value and updating according to the specified conditions.
