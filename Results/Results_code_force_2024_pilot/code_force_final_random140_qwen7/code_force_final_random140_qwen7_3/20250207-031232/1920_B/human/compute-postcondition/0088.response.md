Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[1]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is 2, so `a[i-1]` refers to `a[1]`. The variable `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[1]` to its current value. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
