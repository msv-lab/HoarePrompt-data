Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is an empty list since no iterations have occurred yet.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input, splits the input string into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
