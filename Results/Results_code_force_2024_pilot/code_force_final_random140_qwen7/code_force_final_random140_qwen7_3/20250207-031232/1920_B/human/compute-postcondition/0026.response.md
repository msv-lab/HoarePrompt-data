Output State: **`sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `sums` as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. This means that `sums` is assigned the result of subtracting twice the sum of the slice of list `a` from index 0 to `x + 1` (inclusive) from the value of `sum1`. The initial values of `sum1`, `a`, and `x` are used to compute this expression. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
