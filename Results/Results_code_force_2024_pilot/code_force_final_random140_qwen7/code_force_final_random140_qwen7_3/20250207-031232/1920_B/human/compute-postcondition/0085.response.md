Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` contains `[sums]`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, this value is added to `ans`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
