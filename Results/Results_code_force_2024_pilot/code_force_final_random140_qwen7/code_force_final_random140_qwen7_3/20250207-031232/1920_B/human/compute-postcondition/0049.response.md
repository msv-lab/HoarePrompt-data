To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `k` is an integer input from the user.
   - `x` is an integer input from the user.
   - `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the values calculated by the loop for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = k`.

2. **Calculation of `ans`**:
   - The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
   - For each subsequent element (from index 1 to `k`), the value is determined by either adding `a[i - 1]` to the previous value of `sums` or subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]` from it, depending on whether `i + x - 1 < n` holds true. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, then only `a[i - 1]` is added to `sums`.

3. **Determine the Value of `max(ans)`**:
   - The `max(ans)` function will return the maximum value among the elements in the list `ans`.

Given the above, the `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value among the elements in the list `ans`.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is the list containing the calculated values based on the given conditions)**
