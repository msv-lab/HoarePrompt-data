Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `sums` is currently `sums + a[i - 1]`. After appending, `ans` will contain this value as its first (and only) element. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
