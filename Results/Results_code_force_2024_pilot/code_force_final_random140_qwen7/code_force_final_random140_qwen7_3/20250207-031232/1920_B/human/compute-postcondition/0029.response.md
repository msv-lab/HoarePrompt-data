Output State: **`ans` contains the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` itself remains unchanged by this operation, but it is now stored in `ans`. The calculation for `sums` (which is `sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`) is already completed before this line of code is executed, so no further changes occur to `sums` after appending it to `ans`.
