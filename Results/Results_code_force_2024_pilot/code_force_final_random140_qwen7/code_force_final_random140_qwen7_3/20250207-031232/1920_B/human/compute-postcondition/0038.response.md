Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 1, the conditions for `i = 1` are already considered, and `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the updated value of `sums` is added to the list `ans`.
