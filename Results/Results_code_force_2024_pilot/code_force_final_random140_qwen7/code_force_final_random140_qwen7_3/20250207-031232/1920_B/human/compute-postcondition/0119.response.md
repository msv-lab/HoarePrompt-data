Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `k`.
   - Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was an integer and `k` was a non-negative integer.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Since `i` was less than `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) must still be less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `k`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

5. **Final State:**
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `k` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer**
