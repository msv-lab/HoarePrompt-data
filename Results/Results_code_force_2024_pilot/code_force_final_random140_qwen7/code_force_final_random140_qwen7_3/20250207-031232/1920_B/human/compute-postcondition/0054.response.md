Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list since no iterations have occurred yet.**

Explanation: The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a` in-place, changing its order from ascending to descending. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
