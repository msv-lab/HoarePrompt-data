Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated as follows: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`. `ans` is a list with either one additional element which is `sums` (if `i + x - 1 < n`) or containing one element which is `sums` (if `i + x - 1 >= n`).
