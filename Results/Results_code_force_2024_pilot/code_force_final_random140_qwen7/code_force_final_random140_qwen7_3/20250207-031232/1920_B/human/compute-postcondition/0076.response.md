Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`**.

The code appends the current value of `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` to the list `ans`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a[0]` and `a[x]`, the updated value of `sums` remains as it was initially defined. The variable `i` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` now contains the computed value of `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`.
