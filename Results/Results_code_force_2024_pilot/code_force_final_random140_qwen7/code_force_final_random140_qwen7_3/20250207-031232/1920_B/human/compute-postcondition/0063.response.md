Output State: **`sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to the existing value of `sums`. The variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition that the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n` also remains valid.
