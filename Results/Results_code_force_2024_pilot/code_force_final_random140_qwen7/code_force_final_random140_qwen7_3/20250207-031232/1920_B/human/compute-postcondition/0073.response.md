Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`**.

The code updates the variable `sums` to be the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. However, the values of `sum1` and `a` are not specified, nor is the value of `x`. Therefore, we express `sums` in terms of these variables. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
