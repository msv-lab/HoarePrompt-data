Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `k` is a non-negative integer. If `i == 0`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is set to `a[0]` and `ans` contains `[sums]`.
