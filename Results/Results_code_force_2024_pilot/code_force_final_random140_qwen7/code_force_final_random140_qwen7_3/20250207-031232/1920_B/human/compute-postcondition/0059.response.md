Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` to the variable `sums`. The variables `i` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated value of `sums` based on the given expression.
