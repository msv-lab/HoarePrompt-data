Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range()` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as the input value (let's call it `num_tests`) is a positive integer. From the problem statement, we know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means the input value `num_tests` should be within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the input value being a positive integer, we need to ensure that the input value meets this criterion. The initial state mentions that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, the input value `num_tests` must be within this range for the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value `num_tests`, which must be a positive integer within the specified range.

**State:**
**`num_tests` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num_tests \leq 10^4\)**
