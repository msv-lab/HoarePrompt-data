Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`, the value of `sums` remains unchanged during this operation. The variable `i` and `k` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `ans` with the new element.
