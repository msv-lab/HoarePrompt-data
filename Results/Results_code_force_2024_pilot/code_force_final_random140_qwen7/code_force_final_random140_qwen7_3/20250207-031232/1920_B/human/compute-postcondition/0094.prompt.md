Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `sum1` is now the sum of all elements in the original list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `k` is a non-negative integer. If `i` equals 0, `ans` contains the value `sums` which is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Otherwise, `ans` is either the value of `sums` where `i + x - 1 < n`, or `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0]` with `i` remaining 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `k` is a non-negative integer. If `i == 0`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is set to `a[0]` and `ans` contains `[sums]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i == 0`, then `sums` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`. The list `ans` contains either `[sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]]` or `[sums + a[1]]` depending on the condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
