Output State: **`ans` contains the value of `sums`, `i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `k`, and the condition `i + x - 1 < n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
