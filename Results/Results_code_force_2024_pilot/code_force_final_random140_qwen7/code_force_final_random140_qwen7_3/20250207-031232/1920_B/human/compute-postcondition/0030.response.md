Output State: **`sums' is equal to `sums` plus `a[i - 1]`.**

This means that the value of `sums` has been updated to include the value of `a[i - 1]`. The previous value of `sums` is added to `a[i - 1]`, and the result is assigned back to `sums`. The state of `a` and `i` remains unchanged from the initial state.
