Output State: **`sums` is `sums + a[0]`, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is initially 0, `i - 1` results in -1, which means `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[-1]`. However, since the initial state does not specify the existence or value of `a[-1]`, we cannot determine its exact value. But we know that `sums` is updated by adding `a[0]` to its current value. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only affects `sums`. The conditions that `k` must be a non-negative integer and `(i + x - 1 >= n)` remain valid as no changes were made to these conditions.
