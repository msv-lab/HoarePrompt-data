Output State: **`ans` now contains `sums + a[i - 1]`, and `sums` is equal to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. At the same time, `sums` is updated to be `sums + a[i - 1]`. The initial state of `sums` being equal to `sums + a[i - 1]` is maintained, and `ans` now includes the latest value of `sums`.
