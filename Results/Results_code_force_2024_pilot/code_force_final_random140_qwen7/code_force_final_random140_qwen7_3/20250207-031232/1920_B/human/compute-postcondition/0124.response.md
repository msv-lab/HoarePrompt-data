Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `i` was initially set to `i + 1`. The variable `k` remains a non-negative integer. The code snippet updates the variable `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to the current value of `sums`. Therefore, `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.
