State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` from the expression `range(t)`.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is less than or equal to 0, the sequence would be empty, and the loop would not execute.
- Since `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, it must be greater than 0 for the loop to run. The initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and 100 does not guarantee that the loop will execute; therefore, it needs to be explicitly adjusted to ensure `t > 0`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
