Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes three integer values: t, x, and y, where t is between 1 and 100 inclusive, and x and y are between 0 and 9 inclusive. Based on these values, the function returns different outputs for each test case.**

However, since the function definition itself does not appear in the given format, we can only describe the expected behavior based on the constraints and output cases provided.
