Output State: **i is n-1, n remains greater than 0, a is an integer entered by the user, b is an integer entered by the user, and t remains 0.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, meaning the loop has completed all its intended iterations. The variable `n` will still be greater than 0 as it was initially. The variables `a` and `b` will each hold an integer value that was input by the user during one of the loop iterations. Importantly, the variable `t` remains unchanged at 0 throughout the entire process.
