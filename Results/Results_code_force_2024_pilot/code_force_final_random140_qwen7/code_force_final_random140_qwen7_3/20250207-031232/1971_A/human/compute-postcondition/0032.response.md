Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it prints the pair \((a, b)\) in ascending order. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads the number of test cases from the user and then iterates through each test case, comparing the two integers and printing them in ascending order.**
