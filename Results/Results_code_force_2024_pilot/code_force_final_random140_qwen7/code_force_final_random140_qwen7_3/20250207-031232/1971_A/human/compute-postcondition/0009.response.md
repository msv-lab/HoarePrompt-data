Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input, which means they are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.

The print statement is:
```python
print(max(a, b), min(a, b))
```

Here, `max(a, b)` will return the larger of the two numbers `a` and `b`, and `min(a, b)` will return the smaller of the two numbers `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output will be the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`.

Output: **max(a, b) min(a, b)**
