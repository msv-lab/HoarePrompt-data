Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `a` and `b` respectively. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the initial states of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided as input.
