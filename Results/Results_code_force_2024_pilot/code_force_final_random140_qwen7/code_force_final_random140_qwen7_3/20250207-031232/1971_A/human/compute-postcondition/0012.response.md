Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints, the function does not take any parameters. The provided constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9) seem to describe the range of values for potential inputs but do not indicate that these values are passed to the function `func`. Therefore, the function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything based on the given information.
