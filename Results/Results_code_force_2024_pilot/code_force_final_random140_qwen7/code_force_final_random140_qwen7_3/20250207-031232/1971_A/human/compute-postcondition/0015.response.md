Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` must be 0
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `b` is an input integer
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, then no changes are made.
   - If `a` is equal to `b`, no changes are made.
   - Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Post-Iteration State:**
   - `t` remains 0 (no changes are made outside the loop).
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `a` and `b` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
