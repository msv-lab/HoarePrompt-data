Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0, as the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. For each iteration, `a` and `b` will hold the maximum and minimum values from the pairs of integers provided by the input, respectively. The loop will continue to read pairs of integers from the input until `t` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.
