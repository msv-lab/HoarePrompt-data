Reasoning:
1. The problem requires processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers \(x\) and \(y\).
2. For each test case, the program should output the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) followed by the maximum of \(x\) and \(y\).
3. The annotated program correctly initializes the number of test cases \(t\) and iterates through each test case, reading two integers \(a\) and \(b\) for each case.
4. Inside the loop, it uses the `max()` and `min()` functions to determine the maximum and minimum values of \(a\) and \(b\) and prints them in the required order.
5. The logic inside the loop is correct and matches the problem requirements.
6. There are no conditions or operations outside the loop that would alter the behavior for individual test cases.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
