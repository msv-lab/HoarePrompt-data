Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. According to the problem description, for each test case, the program should output the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. However, the current implementation prints the maximum followed by the minimum, which is the opposite of what is required. For example, for the input `1 9`, the program outputs `9 1` instead of `1 9`.
