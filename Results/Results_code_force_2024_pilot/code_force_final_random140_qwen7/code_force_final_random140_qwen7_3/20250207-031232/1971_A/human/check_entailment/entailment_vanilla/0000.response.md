### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: It then iterates `t` times using `for _ in range(t)` to handle each test case.
3. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` separated by a space using `map(int, input().split())`. This ensures that the input is correctly parsed into two integers.
4. **Output Calculation**: Inside the loop, it calculates the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b` using `max(a, b)` and `min(a, b)` respectively.
5. **Output Formatting**: It prints the maximum value followed by the minimum value, which matches the required format.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to be handling the input and output correctly according to the specifications.

### Correctness:
**True**
