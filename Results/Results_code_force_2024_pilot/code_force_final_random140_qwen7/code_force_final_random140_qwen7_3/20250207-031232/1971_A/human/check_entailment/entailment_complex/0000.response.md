Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
3. It then prints the maximum and minimum of these two integers in the required format.
4. This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.

Given the problem constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9), the program handles all possible inputs within these ranges. The logic inside the loop correctly identifies the maximum and minimum values for each pair of integers and prints them in the correct order.

Since the program matches the expected behavior as described in the problem statement and the annotated comments, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
