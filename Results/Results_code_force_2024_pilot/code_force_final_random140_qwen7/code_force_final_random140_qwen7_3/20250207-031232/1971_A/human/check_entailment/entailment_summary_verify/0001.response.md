### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: It then iterates `t` times using `for _ in range(t)` to handle each test case.
3. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` separated by a space using `map(int, input().split())`. This ensures that the input is correctly parsed into two integers.
4. **Output Calculation**: Inside the loop, it calculates the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b` using `max(a, b)` and `min(a, b)` respectively.
5. **Output Formatting**: It prints the maximum value followed by the minimum value, which matches the required format.

However, there is a logical error in the order of printing the results. According to the problem description, the output should be the minimum value followed by the maximum value. But the program currently prints the maximum value followed by the minimum value.

To correct this, the line `print(max(a, b), min(a, b))` should be changed to `print(min(a, b), max(a, b))`.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program does not meet the requirements because it outputs the maximum value before the minimum value instead of after.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
