Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
- It then calculates the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b` using the `max()` and `min()` functions, respectively.
- The program prints the maximum value followed by the minimum value for each test case.
- Based on the provided example, the program's output matches the expected output.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be functioning as intended according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
