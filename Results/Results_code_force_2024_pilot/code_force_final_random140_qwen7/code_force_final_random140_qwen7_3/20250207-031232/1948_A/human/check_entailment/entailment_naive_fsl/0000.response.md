Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd correctly. According to the problem description, a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For `n` being odd, it is impossible to construct a string where every character is special because there will always be one character without a pair to satisfy the condition of being equal to exactly one neighbor. However, the provided solution does not account for this scenario and prints 'YES' and a constructed string for odd `n`, which is incorrect.

For example, if `n = 3`, the program will generate a string like "AAAB" or "AB", but none of these strings can have all characters as special. Therefore, the program should print "NO" for odd `n`.
