Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :

        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is 50, `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `res` is a string consisting of 49 repetitions of 'AA'.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it appends 'AA' to `res` and decreases `n` by 2. If `n` is 1, it appends 'A' to `res` and decreases `n` by 1. The variable `i` increments by 1 in each iteration. Given that `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, after 50 iterations, `i` will be 50. Since `n` starts as an integer between 2 and 50 and decreases by 2 or 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0, `n` will be 0 after 50 iterations. The string `res` will consist of 49 repetitions of 'AA' because in each full iteration (where `n` is 2), 'AA' is appended to `res`.
        print(res)
        #This is printed: AAAAAAA...AAAAAA (49 repetitions of 'AA')
    #State: `i` is 50, `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `res` is a string consisting of 49 repetitions of 'AA'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 2.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` must be greater than 2. This is because the loop runs `t` times, and for it to run at least 3 times, `t` must initially be greater than 2. If `t` were 2 or less, the loop would not complete all its iterations.
