Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string.
3. **Special Character Generation**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the function prints "YES".
   - It initializes a string `letter` containing all uppercase Latin letters.
   - A variable `i` is used to cycle through the letters.
   - A result string `res` is initialized to store the generated string.
   - A loop runs until `n` becomes 0:
     - If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it appends two consecutive letters from `letter` to `res` and decreases `n` by 2.
     - If `n` is exactly 1, it appends one letter from `letter` to `res` and decreases `n` by 1.
4. **Output**: The function prints the result string `res`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - For `n <= 1`, the function correctly prints "NO", which matches the requirement to report "NO" if there is no suitable string.

2. **Special Character Generation**:
   - The function generates a string where every pair of consecutive characters is different, ensuring that each character is special (appears exactly once among its neighbors).
   - The loop ensures that the string length does not exceed 200, which is within the constraints.

3. **Output Format**:
   - For strings with more than one special character, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string.
   - For strings with exactly one special character or none, it prints "NO".

### Example Verification

- **Input**: 
  ```
  3
  6
  1
  2
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  YES
  AAABAACC
  NO
  YES
  MM
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  - For `n = 6`: The output "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8), which is correct.
  - For `n = 1`: The output "NO" is correct since it's impossible to have exactly one special character.
  - For `n = 2`: The output "MM" has 2 special characters (positions 1 and 2), which is correct.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to generate a string with the specified number of special characters or report that no such string exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
