Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `j` and the condition `range(n // 2)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. This means the loop has already executed for `j = 0, 1, 2`.

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n // 2`. Since `j` is currently 2, `n // 2` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to adjust `j` to `3` (the next value after 2) and ensure that `n // 2` is still greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` is 3
- `n` must be such that `n // 2` is greater than 3, meaning `n` must be greater than 6.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 6**
