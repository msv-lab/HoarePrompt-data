Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignment statements or direct variable manipulations are shown), the only precondition that remains valid is that `t` must be greater than 1. The other variables are not mentioned or affected by this code snippet.
