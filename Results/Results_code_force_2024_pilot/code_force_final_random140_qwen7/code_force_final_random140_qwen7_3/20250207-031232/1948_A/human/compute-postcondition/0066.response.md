Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and checks if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `ans` consisting of pairs of uppercase letters from the English alphabet and prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
