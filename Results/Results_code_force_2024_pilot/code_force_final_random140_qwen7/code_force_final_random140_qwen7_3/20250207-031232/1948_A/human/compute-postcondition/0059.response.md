Output State: `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `x` is `n`, `ans` is the concatenation of `s[x-n+1] * 2` to `s[x-1] * 2`.

Explanation: The loop runs `n // 2` times. After all iterations, `j` will be `n // 2 - 1`. Since `x` starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration, after `n // 2` iterations, `x` will be `n`. Therefore, `x` is `n` at the end. The variable `ans` accumulates the value of `s[x] * 2` for each iteration, so it will contain the concatenated result of `s[x-n+1] * 2` to `s[x-1] * 2`.
