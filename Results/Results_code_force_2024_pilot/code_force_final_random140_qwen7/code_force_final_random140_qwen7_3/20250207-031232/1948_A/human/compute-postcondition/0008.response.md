Output State: `t` must be greater than 2.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` must be greater than 2. This is because the loop runs `t` times, and for it to run at least 3 times, `t` must initially be greater than 2. If `t` were 2 or less, the loop would not complete all its iterations.
