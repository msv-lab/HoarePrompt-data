Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `t` is the same, `n` is an integer input from the user, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `ans` is an empty string, `x` is 0.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `x` to 0, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `j`, `ans`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
