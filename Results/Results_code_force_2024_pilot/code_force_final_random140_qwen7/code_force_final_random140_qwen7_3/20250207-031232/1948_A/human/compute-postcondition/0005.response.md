Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: `t` must be greater than 0.
- **For Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for _ in range(t):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `t` iterations. The loop variable `_` (which is an underscore, typically used as a throwaway variable) is incremented each time the loop runs.
2. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop runs based on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration. Additionally, the condition `t > 0` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was greater than 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 after decrementing it by 1.
- Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

### Final State:
- `t` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute one more time.

### Answer:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1**
