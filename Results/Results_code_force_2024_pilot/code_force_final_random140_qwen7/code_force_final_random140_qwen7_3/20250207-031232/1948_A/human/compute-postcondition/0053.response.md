Output State: **`j` is 2, `ans` is `ans + s[x] * 2`, where `x` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding `s[x] * 2` to its current value. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `s` and `x`, we can only say that `ans` is updated by adding `s[x] * 2` to its current value. Additionally, `x` is increased by 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 2. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 5 is still valid.
