Output State: `i` is an integer between 50 and 100 inclusive, `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `res` is a string consisting of 100 characters, each being either 'A' or 'B'.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. Each iteration either subtracts 2 from `n` and appends two characters to `res` (if `n` is 2 or more) or subtracts 1 from `n` and appends one character to `res` (if `n` is 1). Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, after 100 iterations, `i` will be between 50 and 100 (inclusive), depending on how many times the loop subtracted 1 from `n`. Once `n` reaches 0, the loop terminates. Given the pattern of appending 'A' or 'B' based on `i % 26`, the final string `res` will consist of 100 characters, alternating between 'A' and 'B'.
