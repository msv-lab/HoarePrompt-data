You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is 50, `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `res` is a string consisting of 49 repetitions of 'AA'.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it appends 'AA' to `res` and decreases `n` by 2. If `n` is 1, it appends 'A' to `res` and decreases `n` by 1. The variable `i` increments by 1 in each iteration. Given that `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, after 50 iterations, `i` will be 50. Since `n` starts as an integer between 2 and 50 and decreases by 2 or 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0, `n` will be 0 after 50 iterations. The string `res` will consist of 49 repetitions of 'AA' because in each full iteration (where `n` is 2), 'AA' is appended to `res`.
        print(res)
        #This is printed: AAAAAAA...AAAAAA (49 repetitions of 'AA')
    #State: `i` is 50, `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `res` is a string consisting of 49 repetitions of 'AA'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer n where 1 <= n <= 50.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
