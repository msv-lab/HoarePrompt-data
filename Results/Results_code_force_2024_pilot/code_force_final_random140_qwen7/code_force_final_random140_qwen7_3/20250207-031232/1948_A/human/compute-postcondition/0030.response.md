Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive and must still be greater than 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `n` is decreased by 1.**

The value of `n` is decremented by 1, so `n` is now an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, still greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
