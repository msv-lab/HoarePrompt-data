Output State: **`j` is 0, `ans` is `ans + s[x] * 2`, where `s[x] * 2` is calculated using the current value of `s[x]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` increments `ans` by twice the value of `s[x]`. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The precondition that `n` must be an integer such that `n // 2` is at least 1 is still valid, but since `n` is not mentioned in the code, it is not updated.
