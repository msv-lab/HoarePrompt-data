Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is set to `n // 2 - 1`
- `x` is set to `n`
- `ans` is the concatenation of `s[x] * 2` for each `x` from `0` to `n-1`

However, the code snippet only contains a single `print('YES')` statement. This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `j`, `x`, and `ans`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
