Output State: **`j` is 3, `x` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans + s[x] * 2`**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` increments `ans` by twice the value of `s[x]`. Since the initial state does not specify what `s` is, we keep it as `s[x]`. The value of `j` remains 3, and `x` is increased by 1 from its previous state. The value of `ans` is updated to include `s[x] * 2`.
