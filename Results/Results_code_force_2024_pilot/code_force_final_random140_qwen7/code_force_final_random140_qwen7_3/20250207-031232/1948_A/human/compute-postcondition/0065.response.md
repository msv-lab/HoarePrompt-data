Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. It returns either an error message if `t` or `n` is out of the specified range, or it returns a value based on the relationship between `t` and `n`.**

This means the function indirectly accepts two parameters, `t` and `n`, with specific constraints, and returns either an error message if the inputs are invalid or a value based on their relationship.
