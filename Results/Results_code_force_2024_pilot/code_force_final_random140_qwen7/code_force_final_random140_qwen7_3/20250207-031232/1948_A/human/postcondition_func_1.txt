The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. It then executes a loop `t` times, running the `func_1()` function for each iteration. After the loop completes, the value of `t` must be greater than 2, ensuring that at least three test cases were processed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
