Postcondition: **`x` will be equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, and `rev_res` will be a concatenated string formed by alternating the non-zero trailing digits stripped from `operational_list` elements (if their index `x` is even) and the full elements (if their index `x` is odd). The length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`.**
