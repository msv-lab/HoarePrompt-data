Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `y`. The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations.

2. **Understand the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`.
   - `list_len` remains as a string representing a positive integer.
   - `rev_res` is constructed by concatenating elements of `operational_list` based on the specified rules (even indices: `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')`, odd indices: `operational_list[x]`).

3. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we need to focus on `y`. The other variables (`x`, `list_len`, and `rev_res`) remain unchanged until the loop body modifies them.

5. **Construct the New State**: The new state should reflect that `y` is now one more than it was in the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, `list_len` remains as a string representing a positive integer, `rev_res` is constructed by concatenating every element of `operational_list` according to the specified rules, and `y` is `int(input()) + 1`**.
