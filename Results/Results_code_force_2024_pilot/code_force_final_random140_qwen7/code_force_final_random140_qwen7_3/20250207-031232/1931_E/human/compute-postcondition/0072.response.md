Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies `x` as the variable that iterates over the range defined by `int(list_len)`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `x` is a non-negative integer incremented by 1.
   - `rev_res` is a string with either `operational_list[x]` stripped of trailing zeros or just `operational_list[x]` appended to it.
   - `y` is incremented by 1.
   - `list_len` is the first input split by space.
   - `max_power` is the second input split by space.
   - `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `int(list_len)`.
4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration, `x` will be `int(list_len)` (the current value of `x`) + 1.
   - `rev_res` will be updated based on `operational_list[x]` (which is now `operational_list[int(list_len)]`).
   - `y` will be incremented by 1 again.
5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `x` will be `int(list_len) + 1`.
   - `rev_res` will be updated based on `operational_list[int(list_len)]`.
   - `y` will be incremented by 1.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is int(list_len) + 1, `rev_res` is a string with either operational_list[int(list_len)] stripped of trailing zeros or just operational_list[int(list_len)] appended to it, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space, and `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.**
