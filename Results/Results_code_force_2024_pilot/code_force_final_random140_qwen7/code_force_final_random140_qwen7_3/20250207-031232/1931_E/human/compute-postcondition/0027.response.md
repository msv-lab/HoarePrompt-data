Postcondition: `x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, `list_len` remains as a string representing a positive integer, and `rev_res` is constructed by concatenating every element of `operational_list` according to the specified rules: if `x` is even, `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` is added; if `x` is odd, `operational_list[x]` is added. Additionally, the length of `rev_res` is either greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1` or less than `int(max_power) + 1`, depending on the condition of the if statement.
