Output State: **`x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 2`, `rev_res` is the value of `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')`.**

Explanation: The code updates `rev_res` by adding the value of `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')`. Since `x` was initially set to `int(list_len) - 1`, after executing `x = x - 1`, `x` becomes `int(list_len) - 2`. The value of `rev_res` is now updated to include the stripped value from the list element at index `x`. The condition that `x` is even remains valid since subtracting 1 from an even number results in an odd number, and then subtracting 1 again results in an even number.
