Output State: **`rev_res` is the value of its previous value plus `operational_list[x]`, `x` is `int(list_len)`, `operational_list` remains unchanged, `list_len` remains unchanged**.

This means that `rev_res` has been updated by adding the value of `operational_list[x]` to its previous value, where `x` is equal to `int(list_len)`. The other variables (`operational_list` and `list_len`) remain unchanged.
