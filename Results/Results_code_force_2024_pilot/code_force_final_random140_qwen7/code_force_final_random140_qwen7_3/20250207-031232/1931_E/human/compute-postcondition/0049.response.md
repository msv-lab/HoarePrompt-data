Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `rev_res` is the result of adding either the value of `operational_list[x]` with trailing zeros removed (if `x % 2 == 0`), or the value of `operational_list[x]` directly (if `x % 2 != 0`), to the original `rev_res`. `operational_list` and `list_len` remain unchanged.
