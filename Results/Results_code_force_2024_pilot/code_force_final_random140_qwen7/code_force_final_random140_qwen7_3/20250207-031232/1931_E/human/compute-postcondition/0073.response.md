Output State: **`x` is `int(list_len) + 1`, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` plus the stripped trailing zeros of `operational_list[x]`, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space, and `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.**

Explanation: The code appends the string from `operational_list` at index `x` (after stripping trailing zeros) to `rev_res`. The value of `x` is `int(list_len) + 1`, so the string from `operational_list` at this index is accessed and stripped of trailing zeros before being added to `rev_res`. The other variables (`y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list`) remain unchanged.
