Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `list_len`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `x < int(list_len)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`.
   - If `x` is even (`x % 2 == 0`), then `rev_res` is set to `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')`.
   - Otherwise, `rev_res` is increased by `operational_list[x]`.

4. **Next iteration analysis**:
   - Since `x` is currently `int(list_len) - 1`, the next value of `x` would be `int(list_len) - 1 + 1 = int(list_len)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `x` must be less than `int(list_len)`. However, since `x` is now `int(list_len)`, the condition `x < int(list_len)` is no longer true, and the loop will terminate.

5. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since the loop will not execute again, there are no changes needed for the loop variables.
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `x`, which should be set to `int(list_len)` to indicate the loop termination condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the end of the current iteration and the loop termination) is:

**State: **`x` is `int(list_len)`, `rev_res` remains unchanged, `operational_list` remains unchanged, `list_len` remains unchanged**.
