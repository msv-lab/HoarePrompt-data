Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, `list_len` remains as a string representing a positive integer, and `rev_res` is constructed by concatenating every element of `operational_list` according to the specified rules: if `x` is even, `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` is added; if `x` is odd, `operational_list[x]` is added.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will be the last index of `operational_list`. The variable `list_len` stays the same as it was initially. The string `rev_res` will contain the concatenation of all elements from `operational_list`, where each element is processed based on whether its index is even or odd: elements at even indices have their trailing zeros removed before being added to `rev_res`, while elements at odd indices are added as they are.
