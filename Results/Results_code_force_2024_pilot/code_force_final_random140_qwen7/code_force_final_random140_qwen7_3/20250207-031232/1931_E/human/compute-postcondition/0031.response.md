Output State: **`x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer, `rev_res` is an empty string, `y` is `int(input()) + 1`, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts and assigns them to `list_len` and `max_power`. The values of `x`, `rev_res`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
