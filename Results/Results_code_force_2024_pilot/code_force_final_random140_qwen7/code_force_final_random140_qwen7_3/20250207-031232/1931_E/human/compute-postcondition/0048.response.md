Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `rev_res` is updated based on the value of `operational_list[x]`. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` plus the value of `operational_list[x]` with trailing zeros removed. If `x % 2 != 0`, then `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` plus the value of `operational_list[x]`. `operational_list` and `list_len` remain unchanged.
