Output State: **`x` is `int(list_len) - 1`, `rev_res` is an empty string, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string by space and assigns the first part to `list_len` and the second part to `max_power`. The values of `x` and `rev_res` remain unchanged, and `y` is incremented by 1.
