Postcondition: `x` will be equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, and `rev_res` will be a concatenated string formed by alternating the non-zero trailing digits stripped from `operational_list` elements (if their index `x` is even) and the full elements (if their index `x` is odd). The final state of `rev_res` will satisfy the condition of having a length that is either greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1` or less than `int(max_power) + 1`, depending on the outcome of the if condition.
