Output State: **`x` is 1, `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer, and `rev_res` is concatenated with `operational_list[1].rstrip('0')`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` increments `rev_res` by the value of `operational_list[x]` after stripping trailing zeros. Given that `x` is initially 1, `rev_res` is updated to include the stripped value from `operational_list[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
