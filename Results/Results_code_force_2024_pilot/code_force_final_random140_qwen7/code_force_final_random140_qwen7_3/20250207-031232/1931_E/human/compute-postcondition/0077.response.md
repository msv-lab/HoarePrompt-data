Postcondition: **`x` will be equal to `int(list_len)`, `rev_res` will be a string constructed by concatenating either the right-stripped version of every element in `operational_list` (if its index is even) or the unmodified version (if its index is odd), `y` will be incremented by the total number of iterations (which is `int(list_len)`), `list_len` will remain as the first input split by space, `max_power` will remain as the second input split by space, and `operational_list` will remain a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros. The current length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to the sum of `int(max_power)` and 1.**
