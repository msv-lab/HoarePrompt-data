Output State: **`x` is decreased by 1; `rev_res` is the string obtained by appending the right stripped version of `operational_list[x]` to `rev_res`; `y` is incremented by 1; `list_len` is the first input split by space; `max_power` is the second input split by space; the current value of `x` is even.**

Explanation: The code appends the right stripped version of `operational_list[x]` to `rev_res`. Since `x` was initially even and the code does not change its parity (it only accesses `operational_list[x]`), `x` remains even after the operation. All other variables remain unchanged except for `rev_res`, which now includes the stripped string from `operational_list[x]`.
