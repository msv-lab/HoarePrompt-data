Output State: **`x` is `int(list_len) - 1`, `rev_res` is an empty string, `y` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `rev_res` as an empty string. This means that the concatenation process described previously does not occur. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
