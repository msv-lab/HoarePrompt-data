Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is `int(list_len) - 1`, `rev_res` is an empty string, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(int(list_len)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
    else:
        rev_res += operational_list[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is a non-negative integer, `rev_res` is a string, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the right stripped version of `operational_list[x]` to it. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` remains unchanged and `x` is left as is.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is a non-negative integer incremented by 1, `rev_res` is a string with either `operational_list[x]` stripped of trailing zeros or just `operational_list[x]` appended to it, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space, and `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is `int(list_len) + 1`, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` concatenated with either the stripped trailing zeros of `operational_list[x]` or `operational_list[x]` itself, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space, and `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
