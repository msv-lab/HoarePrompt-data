Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `x`. The loop runs from `0` to `int(list_len) - 1`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`.
   - `rev_res` is updated based on the value of `operational_list[x]`:
     - If `x` is even (`x % 2 == 0`), then `rev_res` is set to the value of `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')`.
     - Otherwise, `rev_res` is increased by `operational_list[x]`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop variable `x` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `x` would be `int(list_len) - 1 + 1 = int(list_len)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be within the range `0` to `int(list_len) - 1`.

Given that `x` is currently `int(list_len) - 1`, the next value of `x` will be `int(list_len)` if the loop continues. However, since the loop condition is `range(int(list_len))`, `x` cannot be `int(list_len)` because it will exceed the upper bound of the range.

Therefore, the loop will not execute one more time because `x` will exceed the range `0` to `int(list_len) - 1`.

However, if we assume the loop should continue (which is unusual but possible based on the problem statement), we need to update the state accordingly:

- `x` will be `int(list_len)`.
- `rev_res` remains unchanged as the loop does not execute.

Since the loop does not execute, the state remains the same.

**Final State**:
State: **`x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, and `rev_res` is updated as follows: if `x` is even (`x % 2 == 0`), then `rev_res` is set to the value of `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')`; otherwise, `rev_res` is increased by `operational_list[x]`**.
