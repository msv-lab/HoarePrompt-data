Output State: **`x` is 1; `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer; `rev_res` is `operational_list[1]` added to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates `rev_res` by adding `operational_list[x]` to its current value. Given that `x` is initially 1, `rev_res` is updated to include `operational_list[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
