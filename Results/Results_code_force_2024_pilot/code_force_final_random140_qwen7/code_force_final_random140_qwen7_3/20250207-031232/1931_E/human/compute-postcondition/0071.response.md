Postcondition: **`x` is a non-negative integer incremented by 1, `rev_res` is a string with either `operational_list[x]` stripped of trailing zeros or just `operational_list[x]` appended to it, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space, and `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.**
