Output State: **`x` is 2; `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer that must be greater than 2; `rev_res` is concatenated with `operational_list[2].rstrip('0')`**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` increments `rev_res` by the right stripped version of `operational_list[2]` because `x` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `x` is 2, the condition `x % 2 == 0` is true, so `operational_list[2].rstrip('0')` is directly concatenated to `rev_res`.
