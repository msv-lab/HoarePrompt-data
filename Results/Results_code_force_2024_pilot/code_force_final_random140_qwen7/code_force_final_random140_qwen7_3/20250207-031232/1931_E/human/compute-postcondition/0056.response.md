Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `x` will be equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, and `rev_res` will be a concatenated string formed by alternating the non-zero trailing digits stripped from `operational_list` elements (if their index `x` is even) and the full elements (if their index `x` is odd). The length of `rev_res` will be at least `int(max_power) + 1` if the condition `len(rev_res) >= int(max_power) + 1` is true; otherwise, the length of `rev_res` will be less than `int(max_power) + 1`**.
