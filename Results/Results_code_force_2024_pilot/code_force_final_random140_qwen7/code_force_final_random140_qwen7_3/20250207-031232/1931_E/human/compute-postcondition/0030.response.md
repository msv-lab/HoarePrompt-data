Output State: **`x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, `list_len` remains as a string representing a positive integer, `rev_res` is an empty string, and `y` is `int(input()) + 1`.**

The code `rev_res = ''` initializes `rev_res` as an empty string. This operation does not affect the values of `x`, `list_len`, or `y`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
