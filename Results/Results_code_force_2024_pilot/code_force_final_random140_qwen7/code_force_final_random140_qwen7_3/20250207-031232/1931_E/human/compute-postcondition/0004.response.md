Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` and the expression `int(list_len)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x` is the loop variable, and its initial value is determined by `int(list_len)`.
   - `list_len` is a string that represents the length of some list or sequence.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `x < int(list_len)`. This means `x` starts from 0 and increments until it reaches the value of `int(list_len)`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `x` should start from 0.
   - `list_len` should be a string representing a non-negative integer, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the above points, we need to adjust the states of `x` and `list_len` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `x` is 0.
- `list_len` is a string that must represent a positive integer (greater than 0).

So, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`x` is 0, `list_len` is a string that must represent a positive integer**.
