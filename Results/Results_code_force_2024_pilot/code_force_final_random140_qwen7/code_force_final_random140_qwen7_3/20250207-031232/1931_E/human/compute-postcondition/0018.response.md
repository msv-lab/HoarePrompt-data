Output State: **`x` is 2; `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer that must be greater than 2; `rev_res` is either concatenated with `operational_list[1].rstrip('0')` if `x % 2 == 0`, or `operational_list[1]` added to its current value if `x % 2 != 0`; `rev_res` is updated by adding `operational_list[2]` to it.**

Explanation: Since `x` is 2, which is even (`x % 2 == 0`), `rev_res` is concatenated with `operational_list[1].rstrip('0')`. After the operation, `rev_res` is further updated by concatenating `operational_list[2]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
