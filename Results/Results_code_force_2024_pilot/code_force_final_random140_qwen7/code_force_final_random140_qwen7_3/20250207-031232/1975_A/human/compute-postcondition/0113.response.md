Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether not all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `new`, and `check_all` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement it was inside.
