Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` equals `n`.
   - `new` is either an empty list or a list starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
   - `new_all` is either `None` or a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are non-decreasing.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the value of `t`, we need to decrease `t` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - All other variables (`i`, `new`, `new_all`, `a`, `n`, `check_all`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (decreased by 1 from the previous iteration).
   - `i` remains equal to `n`.
   - `new` remains either an empty list or a list starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
   - `new_all` remains either `None` or a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are non-decreasing.
   - `a` remains a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `n` remains at least 2.
   - `check_all` remains a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` must be greater than 1, `i` equals `n`, `new` is either an empty list or a list starting from index `i` to the end of `a`, `new_all` is either `None` or a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are non-decreasing, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` must be at least 2, and `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`.**
