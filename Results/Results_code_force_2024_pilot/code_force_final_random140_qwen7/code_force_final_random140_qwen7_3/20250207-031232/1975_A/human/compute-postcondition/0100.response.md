Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` equals `n`, `new` is either an empty list or a list starting from index `i` to the end of `a`, `new_all` is either `None` or a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are non-decreasing, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all adjacent elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in increasing order.**

Explanation: The code calculates `check_all` which checks if all elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in increasing order. This is done using a list comprehension inside the `all()` function. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
