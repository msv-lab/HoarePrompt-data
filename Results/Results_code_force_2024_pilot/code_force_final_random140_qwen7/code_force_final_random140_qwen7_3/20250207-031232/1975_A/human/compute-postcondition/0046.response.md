Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` is an array, and after the execution of the if statement, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 3 onwards are less than or equal to the corresponding next element in the slice. If the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is true, `check_all` will be determined based on the comparison of elements in the slice. If the condition is false, `check_all` retains its previous value.
