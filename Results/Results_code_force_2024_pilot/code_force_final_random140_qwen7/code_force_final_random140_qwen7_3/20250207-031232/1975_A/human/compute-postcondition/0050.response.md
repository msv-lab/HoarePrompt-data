Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` equals `n`.
   - `new` is an empty list.
   - `check_all` retains its final value determined during the last iteration of the loop.
   - `new_all` is `None`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t > 0`, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - All other variables (`i`, `new`, `check_all`, `new_all`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not modified within the loop body (as indicated by the omission).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `n`, `new` is an empty list, `check_all` retains its final value determined during the last iteration of the loop, and `new_all` is `None`**
