Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`. In either case (whether `check_all` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
