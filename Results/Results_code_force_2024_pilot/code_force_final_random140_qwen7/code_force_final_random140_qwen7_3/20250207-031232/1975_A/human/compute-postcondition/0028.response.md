- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from `a[2]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to their consecutive elements in `new`.
