Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `n`, `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`, `new_all` is True, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` must be at least 2**.

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` assigns a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` (inclusive) to the end of the list to the variable `new`. The values of `t`, `i`, `new_all`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
