Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values and Conditions**:
   - From the postcondition, we know that `i` equals `n` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The loop starts with `i` as 1 and increments `i` until it reaches `n-1`.
   - Since `i` equals `n` now, the loop condition `i < n` is no longer true.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` equals `n`, the loop will not execute again because the condition `i < n` is false.
   - We don't need to change `i` since it won't be incremented further.
   - We also don't need to change `n` because the loop condition does not depend on modifying `n` within the loop itself.

4. **Maintain Other States**:
   - The other states (`t`, `new`, `new_all`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted (or rather, remain unchanged) are:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `n`, `new` is an empty list, `new_all` is True, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` must be at least 2**
