Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `n`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end, `check_all` is False, `new_all` is True, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` must be at least 2, and the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`. **`check_all` and `new_all` are not both True**.
