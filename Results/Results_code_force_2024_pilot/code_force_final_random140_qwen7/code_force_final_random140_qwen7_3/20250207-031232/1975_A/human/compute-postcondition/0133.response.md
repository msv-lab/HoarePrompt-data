Given the initial state:
- `i` is 3.
- `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the list `a`.
- `new_all` is the result of evaluating the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print('YES')` is executed.

Let's break it down:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.

2. **Value of `new`:**
   - `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the list `a`. This means `new` contains elements from `a[3:]`.

3. **Value of `new_all`:**
   - `new_all` is determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`.
   - For this condition to evaluate to `True`, every element in `new` must be greater than or equal to the previous element.
   - Since the exact elements in `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `new_all`. However, the value of `new_all` does not affect the `print('YES')` statement.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
