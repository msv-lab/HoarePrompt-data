Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`
   - `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `2`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Given that `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 1, the loop will execute again if `i` is incremented to 2.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 2.
   - `new` remains the same, starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`.
   - `check_all` remains unchanged and indicates the same condition as before.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`**.
