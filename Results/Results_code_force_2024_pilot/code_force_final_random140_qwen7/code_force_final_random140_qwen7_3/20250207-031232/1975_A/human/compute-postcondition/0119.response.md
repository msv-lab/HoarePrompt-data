Output State: **`i` is 2; `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 2) to the end of the list. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and a new variable `new` is created holding the sliced portion of the list `a`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid but no changes are made to `n` by this code snippet.
