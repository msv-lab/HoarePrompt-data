Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from `a[2]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to their consecutive elements in `new`, and in both cases (whether the condition `check_all and new_all` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
