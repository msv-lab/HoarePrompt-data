Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether not all elements in `a` (except the first one) are greater than their preceding element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`. In either case (whether `check_all` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from `a[2]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to their consecutive elements in `new`, and in either case (whether `check_all` and `new_all` are true or not), the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` is an array, and after the execution of the if statement, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 3 onwards are less than or equal to the corresponding next element in the slice. If the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is true, `check_all` will be determined based on the comparison of elements in the slice. If the condition is false, `check_all` retains its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
