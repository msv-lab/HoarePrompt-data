Postcondition: `i` is 3, `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the list `a`. If `a[2] > a[3]`, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])` is evaluated, and if it is true, `check_all` remains False; if it is false, `check_all` becomes True.
