Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`, and both `check_all` and `new_all` are True.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
