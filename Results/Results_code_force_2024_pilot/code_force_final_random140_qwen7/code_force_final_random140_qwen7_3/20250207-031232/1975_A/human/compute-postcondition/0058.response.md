Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `n`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end, `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[i - 1] < a[i])` for all `i` in the range 1 to `n-1`, `new_all` is `None`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` must be at least 2, and the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `new = a[i:]` assigns a new list to `new` which contains elements from index `i` to the end of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
