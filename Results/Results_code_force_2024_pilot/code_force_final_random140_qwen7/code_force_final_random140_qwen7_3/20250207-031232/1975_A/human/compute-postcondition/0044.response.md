Postcondition: **`i` is 3; `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of variable `a`; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the corresponding next element in `new`; `new_all` is the result of the comparison which is a boolean value; in either case (whether `check_all` and `new_all` are true or not), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
