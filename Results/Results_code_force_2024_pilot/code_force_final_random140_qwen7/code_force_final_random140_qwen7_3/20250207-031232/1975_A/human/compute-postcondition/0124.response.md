Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 2.
- `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all` is a boolean that is True if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the previous element, otherwise it is False.

However, the `print('NO')` statement does not depend on the values of `i`, `new`, or `check_all`. It simply prints the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
