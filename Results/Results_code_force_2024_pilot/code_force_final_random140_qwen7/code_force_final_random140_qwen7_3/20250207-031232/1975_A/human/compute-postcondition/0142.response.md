Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `i` equals `n`, `new` is an empty list because `i` is now equal to `n` and the loop has finished, `check_all` retains its last evaluated value (which could be True or False depending on the input list `a`), and `a` remains the same list of integers obtained from input.
