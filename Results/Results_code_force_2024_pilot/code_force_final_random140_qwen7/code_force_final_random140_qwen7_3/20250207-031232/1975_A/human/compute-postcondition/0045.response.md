Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` is an array. If `a[2] > a[3]`, then a boolean `check_all` is determined indicating whether all elements in the slice starting from `a[3]` onwards are less than or equal to the next element in the slice. If `a[2] <= a[3]`, then no additional conditions are applied to `check_all`.
