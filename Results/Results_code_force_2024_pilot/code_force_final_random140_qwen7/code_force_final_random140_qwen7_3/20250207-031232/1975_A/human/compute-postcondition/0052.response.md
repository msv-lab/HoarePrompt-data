Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `n`, `new` is an empty list, `check_all` retains its final value determined during the last iteration of the loop, `new_all` is `None`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer in the input to a list element, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `new`, `check_all`, `new_all`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
