Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` equals `n`.
   - `new` is a list starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
   - `new_all` is the result of the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, and it is calculated as `all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

Given the print statement `print('YES')`, it directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
