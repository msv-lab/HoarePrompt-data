You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] < a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be exactly equal to the number of times the loop was executed, `i` equals `n`, `new` is an empty list, `new_all` is either `None` or a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are non-decreasing, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`, and `check_all` retains its last evaluated value (which could be True or False depending on the input list `a`).
    #
    #In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be equal to the total number of times the loop was executed. The variable `i` will always be equal to `n`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`. The variable `new` will be an empty list since it is only assigned when a certain condition is met within the loop, but that condition never leads to `new` being assigned across multiple iterations. The variable `new_all` will either be `None` (if `new` was never assigned) or a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. The list `a` will contain the integers input by the user, and `check_all` will hold the final result of the condition checked in the first part of the loop, which could be either `True` or `False` based on the input list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The function returns a value based on the given constraints and relationships between the input parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
