Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` equals `n`.
- `new` is a list starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- `new_all` is the result of the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, and it is calculated as `all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
