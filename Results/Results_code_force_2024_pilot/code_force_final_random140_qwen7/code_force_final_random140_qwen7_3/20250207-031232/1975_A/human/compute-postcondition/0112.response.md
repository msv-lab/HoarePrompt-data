Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether not all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`.

The `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string 'NO'. Since no other variables or conditions affect this print statement, the output is simply the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
