### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - The function `func()` takes input for the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes the array to check if it can be made non-decreasing.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The code first checks if the array is already non-decreasing using `all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. This is a valid approach to check if the array is strictly increasing.

3. **Handling Non-Non-Decreasing Arrays:**
   - If the array is not already non-decreasing, the code iterates through possible split points (from index 1 to n-1).
   - For each split point, it creates a new array `new` from the part of the original array starting from the current index.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all` checks if the first element of the original array is greater than all elements in the new array.
     - `new_all` checks if the new array itself is non-decreasing.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such split point satisfies the conditions, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is correct.
   - The initial check for a fully non-decreasing array is handled correctly.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the nested loop and conditional checks for the split points and their validity.

   Specifically, the condition `check_all = all([a[0] > new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` is incorrect. This condition checks if the first element of the original array is greater than all elements in the new array, which is not a valid condition for determining if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping.

   Instead, the correct condition should be checking if the new array itself is non-decreasing (`new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`), and ensuring that the first element of the original array is less than or equal to the last element of the new array.

5. **Example Counter-Case:**
   Consider the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`.
   - The initial check fails because the array is not strictly increasing.
   - When considering the split at index 1, `new = [9, 2, 2, 3]`.
   - The condition `check_all = all([7 > 9, 2, 2, 3])` is evaluated as `False` because `7 > 9` is `False`.
   - However, even if the condition were correct, the new array `[9, 2, 2, 3]` is not non-decreasing, so the correct logic should still fail.

   The current implementation incorrectly returns 'YES' for this case because it does not properly check the conditions for making the array non-decreasing.

### Conclusion:
The provided function has a logical error in the way it checks the conditions for making the array non-decreasing. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final:
Final: **False**
