Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Specifically, the logic to check if the array can be made non-decreasing after one split and swap is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Check for Non-Decreasing Array**: The initial check `check_all = all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not sufficient.

2. **Split and Swap Logic**: The logic to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is incorrect. It assumes that if the first element of the original array is greater than the first element of the second part after a split, and the second part is non-decreasing, then the array can be made non-decreasing. This is not always true.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already sorted
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Try splitting and swapping
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                # Split the array at index i
                x = a[:i]
                y = a[i:]
                
                # Check if the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing
                if all(x[j - 1] <= x[j] for j in range(1, len(x))) and all(y[j - 1] <= y[j] for j in range(1, len(y))):
                    # Check if the concatenated array is non-decreasing
                    if all(a[k - 1] <= a[k] for k in range(n - 1)):
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping according to the problem statement.
