You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: Output State: `t` must be exactly equal to the number of times the loop was executed, `i` equals `n`, `new` is an empty list, `new_all` is either `None` or a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are non-decreasing, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`, and `check_all` retains its last evaluated value (which could be True or False depending on the input list `a`).
    #
    #In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be equal to the total number of times the loop was executed. The variable `i` will always be equal to `n`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`. The variable `new` will be an empty list since it is only assigned when a certain condition is met within the loop, but that condition never leads to `new` being assigned across multiple iterations. The variable `new_all` will either be `None` (if `new` was never assigned) or a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. The list `a` will contain the integers input by the user, and `check_all` will hold the final result of the condition checked in the first part of the loop, which could be either `True` or `False` based on the input list `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - The function `func()` takes input for the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes the array to check if it can be made non-decreasing.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The code first checks if the array is already non-decreasing using `all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' immediately.

3. **Handling Non-Non-Decreasing Arrays:**
   - If the array is not already non-decreasing, the code iterates through possible split points (from index 1 to n-1).
   - For each split point, it creates a new array `new` from the part of the original array starting from the current index.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all` checks if the first element of the original array is greater than all elements in the new array.
     - `new_all` checks if the new array itself is non-decreasing.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such split point satisfies the conditions, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is correct.
   - The initial check for a fully non-decreasing array is handled correctly.
   - The nested loop and conditional checks for the split points and their validity are implemented correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided function correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.
