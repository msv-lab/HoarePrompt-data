Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It first checks if the array `a` is already in non-decreasing order (`check_all = all([(a[i - 1] < a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])`). If it is, it prints 'YES'.
4. If the array is not in non-decreasing order, it iterates through the array to find a split point `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
5. For each potential split point, it creates a new subarray `new` starting from index `i` and checks if this subarray is non-decreasing (`new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`).
6. Additionally, it checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to the first element of the subarray `new` (`check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`).
7. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
8. If no such split point is found that satisfies the conditions, it prints 'NO'.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the function correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
