### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `n <= k`
     2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`

3. **Output Based on Conditions:**
   - If either of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

#### Reasoning:

1. **Condition 1: `n <= k`**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, regardless of Alice's painting. Therefore, the condition should result in 'NO' when true.

2. **Condition 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`**
   - This condition checks if Bob can repaint enough parts to make the ribbon uniform after Alice's painting. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of different colors needed to paint the ribbon with `m` colors. If the difference between `n` and this value is less than or equal to `k`, then Bob can still repaint enough parts to make the ribbon uniform. Therefore, the condition should also result in 'NO' when true.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If neither condition is met, it means that no matter how Bob repainted, he couldn't make all parts the same color, thus 'Yes' should be printed.

#### Testing the Conditions:

- **Case 1: `n <= k`**
  - If `n <= k`, the program correctly prints 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can always repaint all parts.

- **Case 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`**
  - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, the program also correctly prints 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can still repaint enough parts to make the ribbon uniform.

- **Case 3: Neither Condition is True**
  - If neither condition is true, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. This is correct.

#### Re-evaluation of the Program:

The original assessment correctly identified the logic and conditions. However, let's ensure that the program behaves as expected for all edge cases and examples provided.

- **Example 1:** `1 1 1`
  - `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
  - `n <= k` is true, so the program prints 'NO'.
  
- **Example 2:** `5 1 1`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
  - `n <= k` is false, `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 5 = 0 <= k` is true, so the program prints 'NO'.
  
- **Example 3:** `5 2 1`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 > k`, so the program prints 'Yes'.
  
- **Example 4:** `5 2 2`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 <= k`, so the program prints 'NO'.
  
- **Example 5:** `5 5 3`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4 > k`, so the program prints 'Yes'.

The program correctly handles all the examples and edge cases provided.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
