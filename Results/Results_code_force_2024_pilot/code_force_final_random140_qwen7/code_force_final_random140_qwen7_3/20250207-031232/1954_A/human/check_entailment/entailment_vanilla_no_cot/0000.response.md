Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:` is not correctly formulated to ensure that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. This condition does not properly account for the scenario where Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that no single color appears more than `k` times, making it impossible for Bob to repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color.

2. **Output Format**: The output should be in uppercase ('YES' or 'NO') as per the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases**: The current logic fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. For instance, when `m == 1`, the condition should always return 'NO' because Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color regardless of `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        # If m > 1 and n > k, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that no single color appears more than k times.
        if m > 1 and n > k:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- If `m > 1` and `n > k`, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that no single color appears more than `k` times, making it impossible for Bob to make all parts the same color.
- The output is in uppercase as required.
