Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
3. The program evaluates two conditions:
   - \( n \leq k \)
   - \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \leq k \)

4. If either of these conditions is true, the program prints "NO".
5. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

6. The logic behind the conditions:
   - \( n \leq k \): This condition is straightforward; if Bob can repaint all parts, Alice cannot prevent him.
   - \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \leq k \): This condition ensures that even if Alice distributes the colors evenly, Bob still cannot make all parts the same color if the difference between the total number of parts and the maximum number of parts with the same color (due to even distribution) is greater than `k`.

7. The provided examples in the execution summary match the expected behavior of the program:
   - For \( n = 1 \), the program correctly prints "NO".
   - For \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 1 \), the program correctly prints "NO".
   - For \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 2 \), the program correctly prints "YES".
   - For \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 2 \), the program correctly prints "NO".
   - For \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 5 \), the program correctly prints "YES".

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
