Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `n <= k`
     2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`

3. **Output Based on Conditions:**
   - If either of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

### Reasoning:

1. **Condition 1: `n <= k`**
   - This condition checks if Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon. If `n <= k`, then Bob can definitely repaint all parts to the same color, making it impossible for Alice to prevent this. Therefore, the condition should result in 'NO' when true.

2. **Condition 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`**
   - This condition checks if Bob can repaint enough parts to make the ribbon uniform after Alice's painting. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of different colors needed to paint the ribbon with `m` colors. If the difference between `n` and this value is less than or equal to `k`, then Bob can still repaint enough parts to make the ribbon uniform. Therefore, the condition should also result in 'NO' when true.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If neither condition is met, it means that no matter how Bob repainted, he couldn't make all parts the same color, thus 'Yes' should be printed.

### Testing the Conditions:

- **Case 1: `n <= k`**
  - If `n <= k`, the program correctly prints 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can always repaint all parts.

- **Case 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`**
  - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, the program also correctly prints 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can still repaint enough parts to make the ribbon uniform.

- **Case 3: Neither Condition is True**
  - If neither condition is true, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. This is correct.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
