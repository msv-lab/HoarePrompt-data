Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
2. The logic in the provided code checks if it's possible for Alice to achieve this goal:
   - If `n <= k`, it means Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot prevent him from making all parts the same color. Hence, it prints 'NO'.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, it means Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible. Hence, it also prints 'NO'.
   - In all other cases, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the code correctly determines whether Alice can achieve her goal for each test case. The conditions used in the if-statements accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
