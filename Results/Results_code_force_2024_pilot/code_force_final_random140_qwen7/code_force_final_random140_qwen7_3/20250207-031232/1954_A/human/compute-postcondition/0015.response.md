Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `itest` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `itest` is less than `t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `itest` is 1.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `m` is the second integer input.
   - `k` is the third integer input.

4. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `itest` must be less than `t`.
   - Given that `itest` is currently 1, the loop will continue if `t > 1`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.
   - `itest` will be incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains the same.
- `itest` becomes 2.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `itest` is 2, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input**.
