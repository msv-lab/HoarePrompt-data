Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three positive integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (t being the number of test cases). It returns different outputs based on the values of n, m, and k for each test case.**

This means the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers n, m, and k. The function will process these integers according to their values and return appropriate results for each test case.
