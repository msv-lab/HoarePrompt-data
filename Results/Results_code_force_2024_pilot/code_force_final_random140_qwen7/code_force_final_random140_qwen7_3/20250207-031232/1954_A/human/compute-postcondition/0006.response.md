Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `itest` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `m` is the second integer input.
- `k` is the third integer input.
- Neither `n <= k` nor `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` holds true.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Since no other conditions or calculations are performed in the snippet, the output is directly determined by the `print` statement itself.

Output: **Yes**
