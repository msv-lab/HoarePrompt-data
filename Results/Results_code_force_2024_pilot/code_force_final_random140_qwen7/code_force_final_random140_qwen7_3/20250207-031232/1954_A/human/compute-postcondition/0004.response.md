Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `itest` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `m` is the second integer input.
- `k` is the third integer input.
- Either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`.

The `print('NO')` statement will execute regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, as it is not dependent on these variables but rather on a conditional check that is stated to be true according to the precondition.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
