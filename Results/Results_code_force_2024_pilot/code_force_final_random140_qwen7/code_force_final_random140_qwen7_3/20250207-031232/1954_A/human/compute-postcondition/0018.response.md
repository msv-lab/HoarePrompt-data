Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `itest` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the integers split from the input.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output: **Yes**
