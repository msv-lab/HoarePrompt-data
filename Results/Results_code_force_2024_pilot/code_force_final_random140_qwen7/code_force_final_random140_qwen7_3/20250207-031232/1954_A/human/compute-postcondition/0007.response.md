Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `itest` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input. If either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, then one of these conditions is met. Otherwise, neither `n <= k` nor `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` holds true.
