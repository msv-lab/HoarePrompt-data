Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `itest` is 2, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the integers split from the input.**

The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and splits them into `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged.
