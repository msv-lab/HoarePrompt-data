Output State: **t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), itest is equal to \(t-1\), n, m, and k are the last set of integers inputted during the loop's final iteration. The value of `n` is the `n` from the last input, `m` is the `m` from the last input, and `k` is the `k` from the last input. Depending on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, either "YES" or "NO" will have been printed for each iteration, but the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` themselves will retain their last input values.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still hold its initial value (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), `itest` will be \(t-1\) because the loop runs from 0 to \(t-1\), and `n`, `m`, and `k` will be the values of the last set of integers that were inputted. The loop has processed all inputs, and the last printed output ("YES" or "NO") corresponds to the last set of `n`, `m`, and `k` values.
