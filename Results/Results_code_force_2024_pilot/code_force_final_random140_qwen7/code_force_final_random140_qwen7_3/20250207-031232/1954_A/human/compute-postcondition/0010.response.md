Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `itest` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input, splits them by spaces, and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
