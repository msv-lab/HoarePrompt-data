Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `itest` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the integers split from the input.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement outputs the string `'NO'` directly without any dependence on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `t`.

Output: **'NO'**
