The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) where \(1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50\). For each test case, it checks if \(n \leq k\) or \(n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \leq k\). If either condition is true, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints "YES" or "NO" for each test case based on the conditions evaluated.
