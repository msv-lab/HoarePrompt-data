The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 500), `c` and `d` (integers between 1 and 10^6), and `l` (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 and the length of the list is n^2). It first sorts the list `l`. Then, it checks several conditions to determine if the list is symmetric around its center. If any condition fails, it returns 'no'. If all conditions pass, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
