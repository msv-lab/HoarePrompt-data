    #State: Output State: The list `l` is a list where for every index `k` from `0` to `r-1`, the element at index `k` is equal to the element at index `-1 - k`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop condition `for k in range(r)` will have iterated through all indices from `0` to `r-1`. For each iteration, the loop checks if `l[k]` is equal to `l[-1 - k]`. If any pair of elements does not satisfy this condition, the function would have returned 'no' immediately. Since the loop completes without returning, it means that for every `k` in the range `0` to `r-1`, the element at index `k` is indeed equal to the element at index `-1 - k`. Therefore, the final state of the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
    return 'yes'
    #The program returns 'yes', indicating that the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 500), `c` and `d` (integers between 1 and 10^6), and `l` (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 and the length of the list is n^2). It first sorts the list `l`. Then, it checks several conditions to determine if the list is symmetric around its center. If any condition fails, it returns 'no'. If all conditions pass, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
