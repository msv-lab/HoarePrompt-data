Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the given array `l` can form a progressive square based on the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`. The function `func_1` has several issues:

1. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list is not necessary for determining the correctness of the progressive square. Instead, the relative positions and differences between elements need to be checked.

2. **Checking the Difference Between First and Last Element**: The difference between the first and last element should be `(n-1) * (c + d)`, but this alone is not sufficient to validate the entire matrix. The program should check the entire sequence of numbers generated by the rules of the progressive square.

3. **Middle Element Check**: The check for the middle element (`a[r] == a // 2`) is not appropriate for all sizes of `n`. This check only works for odd `n` and does not validate the entire structure of the progressive square.

4. **Pairwise Comparison**: The pairwise comparison at the end only checks if the array is symmetric around the center, which is not a requirement for a progressive square.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to generate the expected values of the progressive square based on `n`, `c`, and `d`, and then compare these with the given array `l`. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    # Generate the expected values of the progressive square
    expected_values = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            value = a11 + i * c + j * d
            expected_values.append(value)
    
    # Sort both lists to compare them
    expected_values.sort()
    l.sort()
    
    # Check if the sorted lists match
    if expected_values == l:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'

# Example usage within the main loop
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))
```

This approach generates the expected values of the progressive square and compares them with the given array `l`. If they match, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
