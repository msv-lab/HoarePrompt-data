Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the given array can form a progressive square. Specifically, the program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array equals \((n-1) \times (c + d)\), which is a necessary but not sufficient condition. However, it does not check if the elements are placed correctly according to the rules of a progressive square.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( c = 2 \)
- \( d = 3 \)
- Array: \( [3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 11, 4, 8] \)

The program sorts the array and checks the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is \(11 - 3 = 8\). Since \((3-1) \times (2 + 3) = 10\), the condition fails, and the program returns "NO". However, this array can actually form a valid progressive square:
\[
\begin{matrix}
3 & 5 & 8 \\
6 & 7 & 9 \\
10 & 11 & 11 \\
\end{matrix}
\]

This counterexample shows that the program incorrectly identifies the array as not forming a progressive square, thus it is incorrect.
