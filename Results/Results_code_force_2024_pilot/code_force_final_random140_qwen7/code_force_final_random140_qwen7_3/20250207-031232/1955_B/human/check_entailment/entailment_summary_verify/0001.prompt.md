You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    l.sort()
    if not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d):
        return 'no'
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if n % 2 != 0:
        if not l[r] == a // 2:
            return 'NO'
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
    return 'yes'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 500), `c` and `d` (integers between 1 and 10^6), and `l` (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 and the length of the list is n^2). It first sorts the list `l`. Then, it checks several conditions to determine if the list is symmetric around its center. If any condition fails, it returns 'no'. If all conditions pass, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list `l` is symmetric around its center.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` of integers.

2. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list `l` before processing it. This is necessary to check the conditions for a progressive square.

3. **Checking the Range Condition**: The condition `if not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d):` checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted list matches the expected range for a progressive square. This is a critical condition but is not sufficient alone to validate the entire matrix.

4. **Middle Element Check**: The program checks if the middle element of the sorted list is equal to half of the sum of the first and last elements. This is a necessary condition for the center of the progressive square, but it doesn't fully validate the structure of the matrix.

5. **Symmetry Check**: The program checks if the elements are symmetric around the center. This is another necessary condition but still incomplete for validating the entire matrix.

6. **Return Values**: The function returns 'no' or 'NO' for invalid cases and 'yes' or 'YES' for valid cases. However, the logic for determining validity is flawed because it only checks a few conditions without ensuring the entire structure of the progressive square.

Given the problem description, the program needs to ensure that the elements form a progressive square according to the rules. The current implementation does not fully validate the structure of the matrix. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem's requirements.
