### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function `func_1`:
1. Sorts the list `l`.
2. Checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted list equals \((n-1) \times (c + d)\).
3. Checks if the middle element (if `n` is odd) is equal to half the sum of the smallest and largest elements.
4. Checks if the elements are symmetric around the center (if `n` is even).

However, the function summary does not mention checking if the elements are placed correctly according to the rules of a progressive square. This is a critical oversight because the problem requires constructing a progressive square, not just verifying symmetry or a simple arithmetic condition.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- A progressive square is constructed using the formula \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\) for \(1 \leq i, j \leq n\).
- The elements of the square must be unique and must match the given array `b`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list `l`, which is a necessary step to ensure the elements are in a specific order.
2. **Checking the Difference Condition**: The program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted list equals \((n-1) \times (c + d)\). This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the elements to form a progressive square.
3. **Checking Symmetry**: The program checks if the middle element (if `n` is odd) is equal to half the sum of the smallest and largest elements and if the elements are symmetric around the center (if `n` is even). These checks are related to the structure of the progressive square but do not fully validate the placement of elements.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( c = 2 \)
- \( d = 3 \)
- Array: \( [3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 11, 4, 8] \)

The program sorts the array to get: \( [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11] \).

- The difference between the maximum and minimum elements is \(11 - 1 = 10\), which matches \((3-1) \times (2 + 3) = 10\).
- The middle element is 6, which is the average of 1 and 11.
- The elements are symmetric around the center.

However, the elements do not form a valid progressive square:
\[
\begin{matrix}
3 & 5 & 8 \\
6 & 7 & 9 \\
10 & 11 & 11 \\
\end{matrix}
\]

The program incorrectly identifies this as "NO" because it does not check the placement of elements according to the progressive square rules.

#### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not fully validate the placement of elements according to the rules of a progressive square. The function summary is incomplete and does not cover the necessary checks for the progressive square construction.

**Final: False**
