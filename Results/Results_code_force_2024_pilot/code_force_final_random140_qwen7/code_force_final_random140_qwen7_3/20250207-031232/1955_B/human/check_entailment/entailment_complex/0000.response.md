Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Sorting and Initial Checks**: The function `func_1` sorts the list `l` and checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the list is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the list to be a progressive square. However, this check is performed correctly.

3. **Symmetry Check**: The function then checks if the list is symmetric around its center. For even `n`, it checks if all pairs of elements from the start and end of the list are equal. For odd `n`, it also checks the middle element. This ensures that the list is symmetric, which is a key property of a progressive square.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns `'YES'` if all checks pass, and `'NO'` otherwise. This is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program appears to be correct. It correctly identifies whether the given list can form a progressive square based on the provided conditions.

Correctness: **True**
