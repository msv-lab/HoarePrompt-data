Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6; `l` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each integer satisfies 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of `l` is n^2. The difference between the last and first elements of `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d).**
