You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and l is a list of integers such that 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of l is n^2.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    l.sort()
    if (not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d)) :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns 'no'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6; `l` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each integer satisfies 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of `l` is n^2. The difference between the last and first elements of `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d).
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if (n % 2 != 0) :
        if (not l[r] == a // 2) :
            return 'NO'
            #The program returns 'NO'
        #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and n is odd; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6; `l` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each integer satisfies 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of `l` is n^2; `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`; `r` is n^2 // 2, and `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and n is odd, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each integer satisfies 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of `l` is n^2, `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is n^2 // 2, and `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
        
    #State: Output State: The list `l` is a list where for every index `k` from `0` to `r-1`, the element at index `k` is equal to the element at index `-1 - k`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop condition `for k in range(r)` will have iterated through all indices from `0` to `r-1`. For each iteration, the loop checks if `l[k]` is equal to `l[-1 - k]`. If any pair of elements does not satisfy this condition, the function would have returned 'no' immediately. Since the loop completes without returning, it means that for every `k` in the range `0` to `r-1`, the element at index `k` is indeed equal to the element at index `-1 - k`. Therefore, the final state of the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
    return 'yes'
    #The program returns 'yes', indicating that the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 500), `c` and `d` (integers between 1 and 10^6), and `l` (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 and the length of the list is n^2). The function returns 'yes' if the list `l` is symmetric around its center; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'no'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'no'

Case_4: The program returns 'no'

Case_5: The program returns 'no'

Case_6: The program returns 'yes', indicating that the list `l` is symmetric around its center.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
