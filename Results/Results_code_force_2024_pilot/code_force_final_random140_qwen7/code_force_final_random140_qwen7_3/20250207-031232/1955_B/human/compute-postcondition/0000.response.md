Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6; `l` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each integer satisfies 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of `l` is n^2**.

The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` itself are updated to reflect this sorting operation. The precondition that `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `c` and `d` are integers between 1 and 10^6, and `l` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 with a length of `n^2` remains valid, but now `l` is sorted.
