Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and n is odd, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each integer satisfies 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of `l` is n^2, `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is n^2 // 2, and `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.
