Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and n is odd, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each integer satisfies 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of `l` is n^2, `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is n^2 // 2, and `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(r):
    if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
        return 'no'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is a list where the element at index `k` is equal to the element at index `-1 - k`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `l` is a list where the element at index `k` is not equal to the element at index `-1 - k`. If the condition `l[k] != l[-1 - k]` is true, the function returns 'no'. If the condition is false, the function does not return anything (or the list remains unchanged).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `l` is a list, `k` is incremented by 1, and `r` remains unchanged. If the element at index `k` is not equal to the element at the index `-1 - k`, the function returns 'no'. Otherwise, no specific action is taken regarding the return value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
