Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` contains the binary representation of `x` (i.e., `x` converted to binary), the list `l2` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length, and `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is an input integer.

Explanation: The loop continues to append the least significant bit of `x` to `l1` until `x` becomes 0. After all iterations, `x` will be 0, and `l1` will contain the binary representation of the original value of `x`. All other variables (`total`, `cnt`, `t`, `l2`, and `y`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
