Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of `total` or `i`. It simply exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no other operations are performed, the values of `total` and `i` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the loop or conditional block is exited.
