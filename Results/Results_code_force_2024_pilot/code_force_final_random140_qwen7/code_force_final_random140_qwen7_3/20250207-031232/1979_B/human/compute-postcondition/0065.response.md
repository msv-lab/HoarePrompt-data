Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` contains the value `x % 2`, the list `l2` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length, and `t` is 1, `x` is non-zero, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `total` stays as 0, `cnt` remains the same, `l2` remains unchanged, `t` stays as 1, `x` is still non-zero, and `y` remains an input integer.
