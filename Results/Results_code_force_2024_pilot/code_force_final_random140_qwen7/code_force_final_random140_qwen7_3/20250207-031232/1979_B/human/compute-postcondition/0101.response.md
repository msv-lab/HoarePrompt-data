Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The initial value of `i` is not specified, but it is initialized to 0 at the start of each iteration.
   - The initial value of `n` is given as the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `total`, `cnt`, `t`, `x`, and `y` are not involved in the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0**
