Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` contains the binary representation of `x` (i.e., `x` converted to binary), the list `l2` is fully constructed with binary digits of `y`, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `y` will eventually become 0 because it is continuously halved in each iteration. At this point, the loop terminates. The list `l2` will contain the binary representation of the original value of `y`, as it appends the least significant bit of `y` in each iteration. The other variables (`total`, `cnt`, `t`, `x`, and `l1`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
