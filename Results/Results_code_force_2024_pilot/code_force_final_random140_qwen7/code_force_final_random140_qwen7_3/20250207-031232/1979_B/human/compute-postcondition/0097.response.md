Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, `n` is the length of `l2`, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the length of `l2` to the variable `n`. This means `n` now holds the value of the length of `l2`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
