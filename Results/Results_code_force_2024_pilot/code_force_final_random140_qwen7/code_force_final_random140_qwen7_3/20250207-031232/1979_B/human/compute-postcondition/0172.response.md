Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`. If the digit at index `i` in `l1` is equal to the digit at index `i` in `l2`, `cnt` is set to 2; otherwise, `cnt` remains either 1 or 0.**
