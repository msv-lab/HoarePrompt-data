Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is now `y // 2`, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value `y % 2` appended to it plus the current value of `y % 2`, `y` is now half of its original value and must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Since `y` was previously greater than 0, after this operation, `y` is now half of its original value and still greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
