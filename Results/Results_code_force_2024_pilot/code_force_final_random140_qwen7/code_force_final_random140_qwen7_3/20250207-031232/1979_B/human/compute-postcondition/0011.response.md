Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is `x // 2` and must be greater than 0, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing `x % 2`, `l1` is now `[x % 2]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x` was previously `x // 2` and must be greater than 0, the value of `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1. Therefore, `l1` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged.
