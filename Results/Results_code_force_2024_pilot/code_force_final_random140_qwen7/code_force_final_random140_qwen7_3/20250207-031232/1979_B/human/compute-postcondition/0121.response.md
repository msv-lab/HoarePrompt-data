The only object in the loop head for the given for loop is the variable `t`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `t`.

Since the loop has completed all its iterations, `t` is now 0 (as it was decremented to 0 during the loop execution). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `i` is `n-1`.**
