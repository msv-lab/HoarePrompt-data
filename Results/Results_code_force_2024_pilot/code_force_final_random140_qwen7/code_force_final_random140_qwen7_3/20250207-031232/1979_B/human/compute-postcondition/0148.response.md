Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is one more than the length of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list `l2`. Since `l2` originally had a length less than the length of `l1`, appending `0` increases the length of `l2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
