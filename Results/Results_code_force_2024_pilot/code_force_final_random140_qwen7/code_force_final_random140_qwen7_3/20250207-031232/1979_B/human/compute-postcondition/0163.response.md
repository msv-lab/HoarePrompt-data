Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`. The current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 0, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables and lists remain unchanged.
