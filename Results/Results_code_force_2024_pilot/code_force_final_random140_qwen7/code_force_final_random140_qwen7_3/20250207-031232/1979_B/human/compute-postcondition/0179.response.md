Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` will have reached the last index of `l1` (which is `n-1`). The variable `cnt` will hold the count of positions where the corresponding elements in `l1` and `l2` are equal, ranging from 0 to `n` depending on how many matches were found before the loop broke due to a mismatch. The other variables (`total`, `t`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
