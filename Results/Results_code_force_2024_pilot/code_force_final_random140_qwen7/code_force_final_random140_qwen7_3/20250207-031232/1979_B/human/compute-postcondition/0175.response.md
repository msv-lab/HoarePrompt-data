Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
