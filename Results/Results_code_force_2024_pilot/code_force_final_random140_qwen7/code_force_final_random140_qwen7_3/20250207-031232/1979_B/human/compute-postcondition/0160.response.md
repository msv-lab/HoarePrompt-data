Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
