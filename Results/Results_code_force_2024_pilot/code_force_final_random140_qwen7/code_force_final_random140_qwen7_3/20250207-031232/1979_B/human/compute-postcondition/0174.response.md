Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is either 2 or 3, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended**.

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. Given that `cnt` was either 1 or 2, it now becomes either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
