Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l2` now has an additional element which is `y % 2`, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` must be non-zero and `l2` has an extra element `y % 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends `y % 2` to the list `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `total` remains 0, `cnt` remains the same, `l2` gains an additional element `y % 2`, `t` remains 1, `x` remains 0, and `y` must still be non-zero.
