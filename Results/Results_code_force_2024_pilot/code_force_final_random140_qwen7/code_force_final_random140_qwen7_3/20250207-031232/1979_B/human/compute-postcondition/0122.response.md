Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `x` and the second input to `y`. The values of `total`, `cnt`, `n`, `t`, `i`, `l1`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
