Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `x` equals 0, `y` equals 0, `l2` contains the complete binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order) and its length is less than the length of `l1`, `n` is the length of `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `l2`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
