Postcondition: `total` is 0, `cnt` is either 1, 2, or 3, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and if `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, `cnt` is incremented by 1; otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
