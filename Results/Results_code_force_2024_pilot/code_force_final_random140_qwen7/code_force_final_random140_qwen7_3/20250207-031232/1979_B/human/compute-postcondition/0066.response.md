Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` contains the value `x // 2 % 2`, the list `l2` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length, and `t` is 1, `x` is non-zero, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 and the result is an integer (floor division). Since `x` was non-zero initially, `x // 2` will also be an integer. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
