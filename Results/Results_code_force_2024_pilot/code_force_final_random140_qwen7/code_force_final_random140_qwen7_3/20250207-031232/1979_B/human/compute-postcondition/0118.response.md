Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is a value between 0 and `n` inclusive, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `i` is `n-1`. 

Explanation: The loop will continue to execute as long as `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`. Once they are not equal, the loop breaks. Therefore, `cnt` will be the number of consecutive elements in `l1` and `l2` that are equal up to the point where they differ. Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, the final value of `i` will be `n-1`. The values of `total`, `n`, `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
