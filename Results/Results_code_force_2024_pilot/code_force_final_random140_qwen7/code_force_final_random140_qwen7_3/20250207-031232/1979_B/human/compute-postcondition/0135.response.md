Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is an input integer, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order, `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `x` will be reduced to 0 through repeated integer division by 2. The variable `i` will be decremented until it becomes -1. The list `l1` will contain all the binary digits of `x` (in reverse order) as it gets appended during each iteration of the loop.
