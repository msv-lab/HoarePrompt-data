Postcondition: `total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `l1` is effectively truncated to match the length of `l2`.
