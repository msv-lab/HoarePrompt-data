Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` contains the binary representation of the original value of `x`, the list `l2` contains the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `y` will eventually become 0 because the loop continues to halve `y` until it reaches 0. At this point, `l2` will contain the binary representation of the original value of `y` (since each iteration appends a bit to `l2`). The variables `total`, `cnt`, `t`, `x`, and `l1` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
