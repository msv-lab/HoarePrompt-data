Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is an input integer, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the binary form of `x` until it becomes 0, `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will eventually become 0 because the loop divides `x` by 2 in each iteration (`x //= 2`). The list `l1` will contain the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order) since the loop appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 to `l1` in each iteration. The variable `i` will be set to -1 after the loop as it is decremented in each iteration starting from `n-1`. The variables `total`, `cnt`, `t`, `y`, and `l2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
