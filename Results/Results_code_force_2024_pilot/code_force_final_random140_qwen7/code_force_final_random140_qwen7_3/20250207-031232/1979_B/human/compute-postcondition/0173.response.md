Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `cnt` is either 1 or 2
   - `n` is the length of `l1`
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `x` is 0
   - `y` is 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended
   - `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended
   - The length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of `l1`.

5. **State the updated state**:
   - `total` remains 0
   - `cnt` remains either 1 or 2
   - `n` remains the length of `l1`
   - `t` remains greater than 0
   - `x` remains 0
   - `y` remains 0
   - `i` becomes 2
   - `l1` remains the same
   - `l2` remains the same

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended**.
