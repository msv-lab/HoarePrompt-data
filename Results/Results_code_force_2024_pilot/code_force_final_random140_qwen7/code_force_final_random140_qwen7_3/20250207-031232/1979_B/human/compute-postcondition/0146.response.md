Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `x` will be reduced to 0 through repeated integer division by 2, and since `y` starts as `x` and gets halved in each iteration, it will also eventually become 0. The variable `i` will be decremented until it becomes -1. The lists `l1` and `l2` will both contain all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order, with `l2` being constructed within the loop and `l1` being the initial binary representation of `x` before the loop starts.
