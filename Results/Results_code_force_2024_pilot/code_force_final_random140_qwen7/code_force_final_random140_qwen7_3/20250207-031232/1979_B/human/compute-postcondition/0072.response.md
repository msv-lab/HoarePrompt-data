Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` now contains the value `x // 2 % 2`, `x % 2 // 2`, and `x % 2`, `t` is 1, `x` is `x // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and floors the result (integer division). This means the value of `x` is updated to its half. The other variables (`total`, `cnt`, `l1`, `l2`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
