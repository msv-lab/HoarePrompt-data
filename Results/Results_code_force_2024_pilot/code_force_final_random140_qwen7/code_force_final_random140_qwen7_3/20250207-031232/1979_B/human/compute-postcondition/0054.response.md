Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `cnt` is either 2 if `l1[0]` equals `l2[0]`, or `cnt` remains 1 if `l1[0]` does not equal `l2[0]`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` must remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Determine the value of `cnt` for the next iteration**:
   - The value of `cnt` depends on the comparison between `l1[0]` and `l2[0]` in the loop body. Since this information is not provided in the loop body, we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt` for the next iteration without additional context. However, based on the initial condition, `cnt` could be either 1 or 2.

Given the information provided, we can only update the values of `i` and `n`. The value of `cnt` remains uncertain but will be determined by the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the same as before, `cnt` is either 1 or 2 depending on the comparison in the loop body.**
