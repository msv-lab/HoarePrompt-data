Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` must be non-zero, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list, `l1` has appended `x % 2`**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x % 2` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `l1` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
