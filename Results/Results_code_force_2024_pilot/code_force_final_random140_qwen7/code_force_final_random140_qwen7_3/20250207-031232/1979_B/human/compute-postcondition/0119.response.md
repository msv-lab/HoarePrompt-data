Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `i` is `n-1`. The loop has executed all its iterations, which means it either found `n` consecutive matching elements in `l1` and `l2` (thus `cnt` equals `n`) or it encountered a non-matching pair before completing all iterations (thus `cnt` is less than `n`).

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `cnt` will hold the count of consecutive matching elements between `l1` and `l2`, up to the length of the shorter list, and `i` will be set to the index just after the last checked element, which is `n-1`.
