Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l1[i] == l2[i]:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `cnt` is either 1 or 0, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`. If the elements at index `i` of `l1` and `l2` are equal, `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is 0, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`. If the digit at index `i` in `l1` is equal to the digit at index `i` in `l2`, `cnt` is set to 2; otherwise, `cnt` remains either 1 or 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `cnt` is either 1, 2, or 3, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and if `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, `cnt` is either 2 or 3, otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
