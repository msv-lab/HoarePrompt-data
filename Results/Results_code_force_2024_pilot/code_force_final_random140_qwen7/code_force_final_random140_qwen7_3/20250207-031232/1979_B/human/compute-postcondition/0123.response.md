Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `l1` is an empty list, `l2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes two empty lists, `l1` and `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
