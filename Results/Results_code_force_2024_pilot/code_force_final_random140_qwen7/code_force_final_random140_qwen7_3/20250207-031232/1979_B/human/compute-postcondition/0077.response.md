Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` contains the binary representation of `x` (i.e., `x` converted to binary), the list `l2` is updated by appending `y % 2` to its end, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is halved (non-zero integer).**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Since `y` was initially a non-zero integer, after this operation, `y` becomes half of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
