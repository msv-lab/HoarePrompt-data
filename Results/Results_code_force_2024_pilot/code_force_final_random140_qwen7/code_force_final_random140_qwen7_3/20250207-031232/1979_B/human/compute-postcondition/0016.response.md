Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` equals 0, `y` must be greater than 0, `l2` contains an element which is `y % 2`**

The code appends the value of `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Since `y` must be greater than 0, `y % 2` will be either 0 or 1. However, without a specific value for `y`, we cannot determine the exact value of `y % 2`. Therefore, `l2` now contains one element, which is the result of `y % 2`.
