The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `y` is given as an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `y` must be non-zero.

State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` contains the binary representation of `x` (i.e., `x` converted to binary), the list `l2` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length, and `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` must be non-zero.**
