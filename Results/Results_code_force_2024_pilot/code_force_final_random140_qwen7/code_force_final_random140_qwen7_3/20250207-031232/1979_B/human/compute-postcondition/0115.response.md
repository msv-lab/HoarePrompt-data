Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is either 2 or 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since there was no loop or conditional block provided in the code snippet, the variables retain their initial states.
