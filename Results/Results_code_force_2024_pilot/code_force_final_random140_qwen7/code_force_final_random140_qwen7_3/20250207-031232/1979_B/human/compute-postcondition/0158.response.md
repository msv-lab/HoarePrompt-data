Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(l2)` assigns the length of the list `l2` to the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, and `n` is now assigned the length of `l2`, the updated state reflects this change.
