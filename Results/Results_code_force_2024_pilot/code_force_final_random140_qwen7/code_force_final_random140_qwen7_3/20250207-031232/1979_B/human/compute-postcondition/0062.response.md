Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l2` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length, and `t` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The values of `total`, `cnt`, `l2`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, these variables retain their initial descriptions, while `x` and `y` are updated to the values entered by the user.
