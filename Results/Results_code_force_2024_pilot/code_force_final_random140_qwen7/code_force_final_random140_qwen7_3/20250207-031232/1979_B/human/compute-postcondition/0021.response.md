Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `y`. The loop will continue as long as `y` is non-zero.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l2` contains the element `y // 2`.
   - `y` is `y // 2`.

3. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to continue, `y` must be non-zero. After the previous iteration, `y` is `y // 2`.
   - Therefore, `y` must be non-zero for the next iteration. Since `y` is already `y // 2`, we need to ensure that `y` is not zero.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `y` itself. Specifically, `y` must be non-zero for the loop to execute one more time.

**State:**
- `l2` contains the element `y // 2`.
- `y` must be non-zero.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`l2` contains the element `y // 2`, and `y` must be non-zero**.
