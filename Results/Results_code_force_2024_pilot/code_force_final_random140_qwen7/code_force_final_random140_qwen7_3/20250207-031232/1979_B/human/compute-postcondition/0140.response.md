Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is now `y // 2` and must be greater than 0, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value `y % 2` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Given that `y` is already defined and must be greater than 0, appending `y % 2` to `l2` updates the list `l2` to include this new value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
