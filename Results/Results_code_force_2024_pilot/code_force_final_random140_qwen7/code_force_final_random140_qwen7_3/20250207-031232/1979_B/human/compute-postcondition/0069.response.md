Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` now contains the value `x // 2 % 2` followed by `x % 2`, the list `l2` remains unchanged, `t` is 1, `x` is now `x // 2`, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `x`. Since `x` was initially a non-zero integer, after the operation, `x` becomes `x // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
