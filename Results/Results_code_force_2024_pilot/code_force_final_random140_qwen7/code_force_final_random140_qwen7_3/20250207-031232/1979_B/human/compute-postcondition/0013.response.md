Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of `y` as its elements, `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is non-zero. Since `x` is being halved each iteration (`x //= 2`), it will eventually become 0. At this point, the loop terminates. The list `l1` accumulates the remainder of `x` when divided by 2 (`x % 2`) in each iteration, which effectively builds the binary representation of the original value of `x` (or `y`, since `x` starts as `y`).
