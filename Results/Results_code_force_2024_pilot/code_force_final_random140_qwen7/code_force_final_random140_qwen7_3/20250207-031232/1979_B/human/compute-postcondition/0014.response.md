Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `x` equals 0, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero. Each iteration of the loop appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 to `l1` and then updates `x` to `x // 2`. This process effectively builds the binary representation of the original value of `x` in `l1` (with each element being a bit from the binary representation). Once `x` becomes 0, the loop terminates.
