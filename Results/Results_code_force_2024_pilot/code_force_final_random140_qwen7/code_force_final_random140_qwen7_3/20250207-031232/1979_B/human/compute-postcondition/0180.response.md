Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0.
- `cnt` is between 0 and `n` inclusive.
- `n` is the length of `l1`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended.
- `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended.
- The length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`.

The loop has completed all its iterations, meaning that `i` has reached the last index of `l1` (which is `n-1`). Since the loop has completed, it implies that the loop did not break early due to a mismatch between `l1` and `l2` at any position. Therefore, `cnt` would be equal to `n`, as there are `n` positions where the elements in `l1` and `l2` are compared and found to be equal.

Given this, the expression `2 ** cnt` will be evaluated as `2 ** n`.

Output: **2 ** n**
