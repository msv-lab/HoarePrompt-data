Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` equals 0, `y` equals 0, `l2` contains the binary representation of `x` (in reverse order) with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is one more than the length of `l1`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list `l2`. Since `x` equals `0`, its binary representation is `0`, which when reversed is still `0`. Appending `0` to `l2` increases its length by 1. The lengths of `l1` and `l2` are such that the length of `l2` was originally less than the length of `l1`, and now it is one more than the length of `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
