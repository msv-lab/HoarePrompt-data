Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` equals 0, `y` equals 0, `l2` contains the complete binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order) and its length is less than the length of `l1`, `n` is the length of `l2`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(l2)` calculates the length of the list `l2` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `l2` contains the complete binary representation of the original value of `x` (which is 0) in reverse order, the length of `l2` is 1 (binary representation of 0 is "0", reversed is still "0"). Therefore, `n` is assigned the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
