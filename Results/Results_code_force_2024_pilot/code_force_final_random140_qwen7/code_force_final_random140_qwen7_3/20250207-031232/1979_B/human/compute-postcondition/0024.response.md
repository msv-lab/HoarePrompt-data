Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `x` equals 0, `y` equals 0, `l2` contains the complete binary representation of the original value of `x` in reverse order.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will be 0 because the loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero, and each iteration of the loop reduces `x` by dividing it by 2 until it reaches 0. The variable `y` starts as an integer input and gets halved with each iteration of the loop, eventually reaching 0 after enough iterations. The list `l2` accumulates the binary digits of the original `x` (each digit representing whether there was a 1 or 0 in the corresponding bit position of `x`'s binary representation) in reverse order, as the loop appends the remainder of `y` divided by 2 to `l2` in each iteration.
