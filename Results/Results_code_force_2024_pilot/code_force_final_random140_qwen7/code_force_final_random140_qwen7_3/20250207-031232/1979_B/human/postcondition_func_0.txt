The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it takes two distinct non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\). It converts these integers into their binary representations, ensures both have the same length by padding with leading zeros if necessary, and then counts the number of matching bits from the start of both binary strings. Finally, it prints \(2\) raised to the power of the count of matching bits.
