#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m) are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. grid is a 2D list of strings representing the field, where each string is a row of the field consisting of characters like '..', 'R0', 'B0', '.Q', etc., indicating empty cells, players, goals, and the Quaffle respectively. t is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` will be equal to `n`, `line` will contain exactly `n` elements, `grid` will be a 2D list with `n` rows, where each row is a list of strings from the input read using `stdin.readline()`. `elements` will be a dictionary where for each key-value pair `{' .B': (i, ind)}` in the initial state, the value `(i, ind)` will now be `(n-1, ind)` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`. `allPlayers` will remain an empty dictionary unless new players are added during the loop, which depends on the input. `goal` will be a list of two lists, each containing tuples `(i, ind)` for each goal position found in the grid, where `i` is the row index and `ind` is the column index, both incremented by the number of iterations the loop executed.
    #
    #In summary, after the loop completes, the grid will be fully populated with the input data, and the dictionaries `elements` and `goal` will reflect the positions of specific elements and goal positions based on the input provided.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a game board represented by a 2D list of strings (`grid`), where players, goals, and other elements are marked. It simulates `t` steps of the game, updating the positions of players and checking for eliminations, goal completions, and catching the golden snitch. After all steps, it prints the final scores for both teams.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pos is a string representing a position on the field, where the position is one of the characters 'RG', 'BG', or a coordinate pair like 'R1', 'B2', etc., indicating a player or a goal. The function checks if the given position is a red goal ('RG') or a blue goal ('BG'), and returns 0 for a red goal, 1 for a blue goal, and -1 otherwise.
def goalIn(pos):
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res
    #The program returns 0 or 1 or -1 depending on the value of `pos`. If `pos` is 'RG', the program returns 0; if `pos` is 'BG', the program returns 1; otherwise, the program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `goalIn` accepts a string `pos` representing a position on the field. It returns 0 if `pos` is 'RG' (indicating a red goal), 1 if `pos` is 'BG' (indicating a blue goal), and -1 for any other value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: el is a string representing an entity on the field, where the first character is the team of the entity ('R' for red, 'B' for blue) and the second character is additional information (e.g., player number or 'G' for goal).
def isPlayer(el):
    res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
    return res
    #The program returns a boolean value 'res' which is True if the first character of 'el' is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `isPlayer` accepts a string `el` and returns `True` if the first character of `el` is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise it returns `False`.
