Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line from standard input and splitting it by whitespace, `grid` is a list that now includes the `line` list.**

The code `grid.append(line)` appends the `line` list to the `grid` list. Since `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line from standard input and splitting it by whitespace, and no other changes are made to `n`, `i`, or `line`, these variables retain their initial states. The `grid` list is updated to include the newly appended `line`.
