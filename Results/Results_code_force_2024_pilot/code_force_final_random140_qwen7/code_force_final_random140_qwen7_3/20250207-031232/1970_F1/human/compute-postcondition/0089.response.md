Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ind in range(len(line))`. The variable `ind` is being used in the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of `ind`**: According to the given information, `ind` is initially set to `len(line) - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `len(line)`. Since `ind` starts at `len(line) - 1`, the loop will execute at least once (because `ind` will become `len(line) - 2` after the first iteration).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The variable `ind` should be set to `len(line) - 1`.
   - The loop will increment `ind` in each iteration until it reaches `len(line)`. Therefore, the final value of `ind` after the loop completes will be `len(line) - 1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `ind` should be set to `len(line) - 1`.

Therefore, the modified state is:

**State: **`ind` is `len(line) - 1`**
