Output State: **`elements[obj]` is now equal to `nxt`, `command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `time` is time + 1, `pos` is equal to `elements[obj]`, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `team`, `points`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, `elements`, etc., remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `elements[obj]` to `nxt`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
