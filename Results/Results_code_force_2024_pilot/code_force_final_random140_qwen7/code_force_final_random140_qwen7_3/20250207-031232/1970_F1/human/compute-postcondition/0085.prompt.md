Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `line` is a list of strings, `grid` is a list that includes the original `line` list as its last element, `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` are populated based on the conditions specified within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element, `elements` is updated such that `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, `ind` is 0, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`. If `line[ind]` is a player, `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to `(i, ind-1)` and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` and the current character in `line[ind]` is `'G'`, then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[tmp]` is appended with `(i, ind)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, `ind` is 1. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)` to its list; otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, `ind` is 2. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[2]]` is set to `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false and `line[ind][1]` equals 'G', then `tmp` is set to 0 and `goal[0]` contains ((i, 2)).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
