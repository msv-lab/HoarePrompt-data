Output State: **`elements[elements[line[ind]]]` is `(i, ind)`, `ind` is `len(line) - 1`, `tmp` is `0`**.

Explanation: The code checks if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B'. Since `ind` is `len(line) - 1`, `line[ind]` refers to the last element in the list `line`. If the first character of this last element is 'B', `tmp` would be 0; otherwise, it would be 1. Given no specific value for `line[ind][0]` is provided, we assume the condition evaluates to 'B' (as per the example logic), making `tmp` equal to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.
