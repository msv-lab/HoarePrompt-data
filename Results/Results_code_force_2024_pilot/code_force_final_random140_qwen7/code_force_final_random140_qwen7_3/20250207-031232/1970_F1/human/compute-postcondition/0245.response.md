Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `time` is time + 1, `player` is determined based on the elements of `command`. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is set to True in the dictionary `allPlayers` if `el` equals '.Q'. If `el` does not equal '.Q', `team` is set to 1 if the first character of `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0; `points[team]` is incremented by 10. `obj` is set to `False` in `allPlayers`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`. `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. `points`, `pos`, `nxt`, `com`, `el`, `team`, `elements`, etc., remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` remains the same.
