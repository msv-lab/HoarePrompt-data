Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **team**: This is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`. We don't have the exact value, but it is a team identifier.

2. **obj**: This is the first element of `comand`.

3. **com**: This is the second element of `comand`. It is given that `com` is equal to 'T'.

4. **pos**: This is the value of the element in the list `elements` at index `obj`. Since `obj` is not equal to '.', `pos` is a valid position in the `elements` list.

5. **nxt**: This is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. Given that `com` is 'T', we need to know the movement vector `mov['T']`. However, since the exact movement vector is not provided, we'll denote it as `mov['T'] = (dx, dy)`. Therefore, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + dx, pos[1] + dy)`.

6. **isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])**: This is false, meaning the cell at `nxt` is not occupied by a player.

7. **isPlayer(obj)**: This is false, meaning the object at `obj` is not a player.

8. **elements['.B']**: This is not equal to `nxt`, meaning the position `nxt` is not the same as the position of `.B` in the `elements` list.

9. **allPlayers[obj]**: This is set to `False`, meaning the object at `obj` is not a player.

Given these conditions, the print statement is:
```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

- `time`: This is an unspecified variable, so we will keep it as `time`.
- `team`: As mentioned earlier, this is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with the current time and the name of the team that scored the goal.

Output: **%d [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where [GoalName[team]] is the name of the team that scored the goal and [time] is the current time)**
