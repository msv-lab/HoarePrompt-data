Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `ind` using `range(len(line))`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `ind`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `ind` is within the range of `len(line)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ind` is 2.

3. **Calculate the Next Value of `ind`**: Since the loop increments `ind` by 1 each time it iterates, the next value of `ind` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.

4. **Check the Range Condition**: We need to ensure that `ind` is still within the range of `len(line)` for the next iteration. If `line` has at least one element, then `len(line)` is at least 1. Since `ind` is 3, the condition `ind < len(line)` must hold true for the next iteration. This means `len(line)` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `ind` will be 3.
   - `line` must have at least 4 elements (since `ind` must be less than `len(line)`).

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings with at least 4 elements, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list, `ind` is 3**
