Postcondition: `ind` is `len(line) - 1`, `elements[elements[line[ind]]]` is `i`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `ind` is assigned to the same value as before. Otherwise, if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `goal[tmp]` contains a tuple `(i, ind)`. In all cases, `ind` is assigned to the same value as before.
