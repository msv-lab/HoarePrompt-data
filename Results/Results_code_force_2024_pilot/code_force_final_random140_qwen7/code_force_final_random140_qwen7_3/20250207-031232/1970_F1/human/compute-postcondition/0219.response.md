Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `time` is time + 1, `obj` is set to True in the dictionary `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, `elements`, etc., remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` remains the same.**

In this output state, the dictionary `allPlayers` has been updated such that the key `obj` is now associated with the boolean value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
