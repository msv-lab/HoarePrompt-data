Based on the initial state provided:

- `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`.
- `command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin.
- `obj` is the first element of `command`.
- `com` is the second element of `command`.
- `time` is incremented by 1.
- `pos` is equal to `elements[obj]`.
- `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.
- Other variables like `obj`, `com`, `el`, `team`, `points`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, `elements`, etc., remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
- `t` remains the same.

The print statement is:
```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the components:
- `time`: This is the current time, which is `time + 1` after the last iteration.
- `GoalName[team]`: This is the name of the team that scored a goal, corresponding to the `team` variable which is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

Since the exact values of `time` and `team` are not explicitly given, we need to describe them in terms of their definitions.

Output: **%d [time + 1] GOAL where [time + 1] is the incremented time and [team] is the result of goalIn(elements[obj])**
