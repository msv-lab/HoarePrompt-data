Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line from standard input and splitting it by whitespace, `grid` is a list that now includes the `line` list.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, then `elements[line[ind]]` is equal to `(False, ind)`. Otherwise, `elements[line[ind]]` is not equal to `(i, ind)`, and either `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) includes the tuple `(i, ind)` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list, `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is not equal to `'..'`, then either `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, or `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list that now includes the tuple `(2, 2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings with at least 4 elements, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list, `ind` is 3. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False and `ind` remains 3. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns True, then `tmp` is 0 if `line[3][0]` equals 'B', else `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` is a list that now includes the tuple `(2, 3)` if `line[3][1]` equals 'G', otherwise `tmp` remains as it was.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
