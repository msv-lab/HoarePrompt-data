Postcondition: `command` is split into `obj` and `com`, `time` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `pos` is now equal to `elements[obj]`, `pos`, `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player`, and `elements[obj]` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration. If `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False` and if the function `goalIn(pos)` returns a valid team, the points for that team are incremented by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
