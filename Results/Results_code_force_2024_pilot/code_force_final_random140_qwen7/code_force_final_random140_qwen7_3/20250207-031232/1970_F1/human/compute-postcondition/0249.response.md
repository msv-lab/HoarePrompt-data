Functionality: **The function processes a game board represented by a 2D list of strings (`grid`), where players, goals, and other elements are marked. It simulates `t` steps of the game, updating the positions of players and checking for eliminations, goal completions, and catching the golden snitch. After all steps, it prints the final scores for both teams.**
