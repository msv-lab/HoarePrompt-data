Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `team` is determined by the first character of `obj[0]`.
     - If `obj[0][0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is incremented by 10. This means:
     - If `team` is 1, `points[1]` is `points[1] + 10`.
     - If `team` is 0, `points[0]` is `points[0] + 10`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))`.
   - Here, `%d` is used to format `time` as a decimal integer.
   - `%s` is used to format `GoalName[team]` as a string.
   - `time` and `GoalName[team]` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume their values for the output.

Given the information, we can conclude that the print statement will output a string with the value of `time` followed by a space, followed by the string `CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`, and finally followed by the string `GoalName[team]`.

Since the exact values of `time` and `GoalName[team]` are not provided, we will represent them in the output as placeholders.

Output: **%d CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where %d is the value of time and SNITCH is replaced by GoalName[team])**
