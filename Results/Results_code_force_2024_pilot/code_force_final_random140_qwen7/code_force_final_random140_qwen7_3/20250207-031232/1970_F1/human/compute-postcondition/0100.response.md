Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `ind` is `len(line) - 1`, `elements[elements[line[ind]]]` is `i`, `goal[tmp]` contains a tuple `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial state, `tmp` is 0 and `ind` is `len(line) - 1`. The value of `elements[elements[line[ind]]]` remains `i` as no changes were made to it. After executing the code, `goal[0]` (since `tmp` is 0) will contain the tuple `(i, ind)`.
