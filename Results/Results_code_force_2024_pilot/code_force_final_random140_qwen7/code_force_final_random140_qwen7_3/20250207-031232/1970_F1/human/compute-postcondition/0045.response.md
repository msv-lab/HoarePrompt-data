Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed.
   - `line` is a list of strings with at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.
   - `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list.
   - `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` are populated based on certain conditions within the loop.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to the current value of `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `n`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`i < n`) will no longer be true because `i` will now be equal to `n`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `line` is a list of strings with at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list, `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` are populated based on the conditions specified within the loop.**
