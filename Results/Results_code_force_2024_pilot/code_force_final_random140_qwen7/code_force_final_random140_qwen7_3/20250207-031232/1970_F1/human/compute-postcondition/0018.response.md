Output State: **`tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list, `elements[line[ind]]` is not equal to `(i, ind)`, and the current value of `line[ind][1]` is 'G'.**

This means that the variable `tmp` is assigned a value of 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise it is assigned a value of 1. All other variables retain their original conditions from the initial state.
