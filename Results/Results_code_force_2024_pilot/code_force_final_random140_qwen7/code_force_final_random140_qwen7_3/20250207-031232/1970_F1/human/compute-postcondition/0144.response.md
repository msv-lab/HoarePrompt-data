Output State: **`obj` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj`[0] is 'B', `obj`[1] is `com`, `obj`[2] is `el`, `team` is 1, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command` and its current value is '.S'.**

Explanation: The code checks if the first element of the list `obj` (which is `obj[0]`) is equal to 'B'. Since `obj[0]` is 'B', the condition evaluates to true, and `team` is assigned the value 1. The values of `obj`, `com`, and `el` remain unchanged.
