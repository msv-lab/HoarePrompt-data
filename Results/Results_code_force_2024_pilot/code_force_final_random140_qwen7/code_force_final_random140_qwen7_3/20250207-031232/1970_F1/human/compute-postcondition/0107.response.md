Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that at the end of the previous iteration, `ind` is equal to `len(line) - 1`. The postcondition specifies what happens based on the value of `line[ind]`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `ind` from `0` to `len(line) - 1`.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**:
   - If `line[ind] != '..` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `ind` remains unchanged.
   - If `line[ind] != '..` and `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `goal[tmp]` contains a tuple `(i, ind)`. In this case, `ind` is still the same as before.
   - In all cases, `ind` is assigned to the same value as before.

4. **Current Value of `ind`**: Since `ind` is `len(line) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop has already processed all indices up to `len(line) - 1`.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be set to `0` (the first index). However, since the postcondition ensures that `ind` does not change unless specific conditions are met, and these conditions do not apply to the current value of `ind` (`len(line) - 1`), `ind` will remain `len(line) - 1`.

6. **Adjusting the State**: The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `ind`. Given that the loop will not proceed further from `ind = len(line) - 1`, we need to ensure that the state reflects this.

**Final State**:
- `ind` remains `len(line) - 1`.
- No other changes are needed because the loop cannot proceed further.

**Answer**:
State: **`ind` is `len(line) - 1`**
