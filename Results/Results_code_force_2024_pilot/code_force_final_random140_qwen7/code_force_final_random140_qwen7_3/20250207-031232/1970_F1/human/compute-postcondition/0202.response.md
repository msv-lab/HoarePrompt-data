Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `command` is split into `obj` and `com`.
   - `time` is incremented by 1.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `obj`, `com`, `el`, `pos` is now equal to `elements[obj]`.
   - `pos`, `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`.
   - `player`, `elements[obj]` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`.
   - `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `time` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`, which determines the team based on the position `pos`.

Given these details, let's determine what will be printed:

- `%d` will be replaced by the current value of `time`.
- `%s` will be replaced by the string `GoalName[team]`, where `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`.

Therefore, the output will be a string that includes the current value of `time` followed by the string "GOAL" and the name of the team that scored the goal.

Output: **%d GOAL (where %d is the current value of time and GOAL is replaced by the name of the team determined by the function goalIn(pos))**
