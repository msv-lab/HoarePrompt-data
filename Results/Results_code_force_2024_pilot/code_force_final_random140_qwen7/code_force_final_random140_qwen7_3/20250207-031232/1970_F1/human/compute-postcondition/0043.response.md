Output State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations executed, `line` is a list of strings with a length equal to the total number of elements processed in the loop, `grid` is a list that includes all the `line` lists read from standard input. For each non-`'..'` element in `line`, if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, and `tmp` is determined based on the first character of `line[ind]`. If `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, then `goal[tmp]` is updated to include the tuple `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, but `allPlayers[line[ind]]` remains `None`.
