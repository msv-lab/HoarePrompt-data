State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
- The loop condition `range(n)` means that the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute even once.
- Since `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop, no adjustment is needed for `i` itself, but we need to ensure that the loop can start by setting `n` to a value greater than 0.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute. The initial state of `i` being 0 is already correct for the loop to start.
