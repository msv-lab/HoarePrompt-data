Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`command` is split into `obj` and `com`:**
   - This means `command` is a string that is split into two parts: `obj` and `com`.

2. **`time` is incremented by 1:**
   - The value of `time` is increased by 1.

3. **`t` remains the same:**
   - The value of `t` does not change.

4. **`obj`, `com`, `el`, `pos` is now equal to `elements[obj]`:**
   - `el` and `pos` are assigned the value of `elements[obj]`. This implies that `elements` is a dictionary or a similar data structure where the key is `obj` and the value is a tuple containing `el` and `pos`.

5. **`pos`, `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`:**
   - `nxt` is a new position calculated by adding the movement vector `mov[com]` to the current position `pos`.

6. **`player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`:**
   - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is set to `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is set to the value at the grid position `nxt`.

7. **`elements[obj]` remains unchanged:**
   - The value of `elements[obj]` does not change after the operations described above.

Now, let's look at the print statement:
```python
print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
```

- `%d` is used to format `time` as an integer.
- `%s` is used to format `player` as a string.

Given the information from the initial state, the print statement will output the current value of `time` followed by the value of `player` and the word "ELIMINATED".

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **%d player ELIMINATED** (where `%d` is the incremented value of `time` and `player` is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `isPlayer(obj)` is `False`).
