Postcondition: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the list `elements` at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player` is assigned the value of `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is assigned the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, if `com == 'T'` and `goalIn(pos) != -1`, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true, `isPlayer(obj)` is true, or `elements['.B']` is equal to `nxt`.**
