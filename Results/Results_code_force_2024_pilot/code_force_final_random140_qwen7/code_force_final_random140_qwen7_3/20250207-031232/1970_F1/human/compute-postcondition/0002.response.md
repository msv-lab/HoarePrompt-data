The function `isPlayer` accepts a parameter `el`, which is a string. The string `el` represents an entity on the field, where the first character indicates the team ('R' for red, 'B' for blue) and the second character provides additional information (e.g., player number or 'G' for goal). The function returns a boolean value `res`, which is True if the first character of `el` is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise it returns False.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `el`, returns `True` if the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise it returns `False`.**
