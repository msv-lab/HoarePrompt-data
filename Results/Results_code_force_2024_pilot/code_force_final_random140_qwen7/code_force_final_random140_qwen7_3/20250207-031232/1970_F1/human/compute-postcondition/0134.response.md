Output State: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input using `stdin.readline()`, strips any leading or trailing whitespace with `.strip()`, and then splits the resulting string into a list of substrings using `.split()`. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `comand`. No other variables are affected, so their initial states remain unchanged.
