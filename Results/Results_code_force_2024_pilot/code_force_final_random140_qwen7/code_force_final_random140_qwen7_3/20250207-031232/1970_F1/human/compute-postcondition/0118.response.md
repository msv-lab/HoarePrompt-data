Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `ind`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `ind = 0` to `ind = len(line) - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ind` is `len(line) - 1`.
   - If `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, then `elements[elements[line[ind]]]` is `(i, ind)`, `tmp` is `0`, and `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`.
   - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` evaluates to `False`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `ind` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `ind` would be `len(line) - 1 + 1 = len(line)`.
   - However, since the loop condition is `ind < len(line)`, when `ind` reaches `len(line) - 1`, the loop will stop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `ind` will be incremented to `len(line)`, but since the loop condition checks if `ind < len(line)`, the loop will terminate.
   - No other variables are affected by the loop head itself; they are modified within the loop body based on the value of `ind`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `ind`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ind` is `len(line)`**
