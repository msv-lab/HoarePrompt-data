Output State: **`team` is 1 if the first character of `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0; `points[team]` is `points[team] + 10`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. Since `team` is determined by the first character of `obj[0]`, it remains unchanged. Therefore, `points[team]` will have its current value plus 10.
