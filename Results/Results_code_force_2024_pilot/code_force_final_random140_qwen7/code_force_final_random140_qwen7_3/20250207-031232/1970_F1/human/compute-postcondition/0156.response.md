Postcondition: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the list `elements` at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. The condition is met where either `obj` is equal to `.B` and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player's piece or `obj` is a player's piece and the position of `.B` in `elements` is equal to `nxt`.**
