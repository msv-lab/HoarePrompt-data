Output State: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin; `obj` is the first element of `comand`; `com` is the second element of `comand`; `el` is the third element of `comand`; `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True.**

In this output state, the `allPlayers` dictionary has been updated such that the key `obj` (which is the first element of the `comand` list) is now associated with the boolean value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
