Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, `ind` is 2, and if `line[ind][1]` equals 'G', then `tmp` is set to 0 and `goal[0]` contains ((i, 2)). If `line[ind][1]` does not equal 'G', then `tmp` remains unchanged.
