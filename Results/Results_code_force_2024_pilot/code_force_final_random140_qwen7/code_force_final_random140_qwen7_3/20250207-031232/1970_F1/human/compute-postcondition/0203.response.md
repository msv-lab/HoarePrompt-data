Output State: **`command` is split into `obj` and `com`, `time` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `pos` is now equal to `elements[obj]`, `pos`, `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player`, `elements[obj]` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration; `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`, `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`, points[`team`] is incremented by 1.**

This means that after executing the line `points[team] += 1`, the `points` dictionary has had its value for the key `team` increased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
