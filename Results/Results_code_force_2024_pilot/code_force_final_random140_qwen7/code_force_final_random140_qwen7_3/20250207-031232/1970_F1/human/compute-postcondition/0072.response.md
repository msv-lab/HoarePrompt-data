Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0; `line` is a list of strings with at least 1 element; `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element; `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`; `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged; `ind` is 1; if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)` to its list; otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
