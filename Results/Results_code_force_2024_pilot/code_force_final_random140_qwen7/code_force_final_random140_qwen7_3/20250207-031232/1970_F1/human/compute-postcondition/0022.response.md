Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, then `elements[line[ind]]` is equal to `(False, ind)`. Otherwise, `elements[line[ind]]` is not equal to `(i, ind)`, and either `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) includes the tuple `(i, ind)` appended to it.
