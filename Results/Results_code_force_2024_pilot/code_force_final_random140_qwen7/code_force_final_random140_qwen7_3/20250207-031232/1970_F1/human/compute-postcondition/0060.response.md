Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element, `elements` is updated such that `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, `ind` is 0, the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, the function `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and the current character in `line[ind]` is `'G'`, `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` is appended with `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `ind` is 0 and the current character in `line[ind]` is `'G'`, the tuple `(i, 0)` is added to `goal[tmp]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
