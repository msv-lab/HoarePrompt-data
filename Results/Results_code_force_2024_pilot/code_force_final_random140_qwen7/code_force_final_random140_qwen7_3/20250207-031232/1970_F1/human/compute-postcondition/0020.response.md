Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list, `elements[line[ind]]` is not equal to `(i, ind)`, and if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(i, ind)` appended to it.
