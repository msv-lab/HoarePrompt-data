Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `time` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `for time in range(t)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `time < t`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin.
   - Depending on the length of `comand`, different assignments are made:
     - If `len(comand) == 3`, then `obj`, `com`, and `el` are assigned based on the elements of `comand`.
     - If `len(comand) != 3`, then `obj`, `com`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, and `elements[obj]` are assigned based on certain conditions.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is based on `time < t`, we need to increment `time` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `time` should be incremented by 1.
   - `t` remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `time` is incremented by 1, `t` is the same as before, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, and `elements[obj]` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**
