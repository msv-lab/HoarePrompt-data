Postcondition: `comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin; `obj` is the first element of `comand`; `com` is the second element of `comand`; `el` is the third element of `comand`. If `el` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. Otherwise, `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', and to 0 otherwise. Additionally, `points[team]` is increased by 10.
