Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `time` is time + 1, `obj` is set to True in the dictionary `allPlayers` if `el` equals '.Q'. If `el` does not equal '.Q', then `team` is set to 1 if the first character of `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0; `points[team]` is incremented by 10. `points`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, `elements`, etc., remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` remains the same.
