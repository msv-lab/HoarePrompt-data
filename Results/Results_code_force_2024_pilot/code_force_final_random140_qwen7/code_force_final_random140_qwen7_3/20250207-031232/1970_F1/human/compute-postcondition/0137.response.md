Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`.**

Explanation: The code unpacks the list `command` into three variables `obj`, `com`, and `el`. Since `command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, and its length is equal to 3, the values of `obj`, `com`, and `el` are the first, second, and third elements of `command`, respectively. All other information about the initial state remains unchanged.
