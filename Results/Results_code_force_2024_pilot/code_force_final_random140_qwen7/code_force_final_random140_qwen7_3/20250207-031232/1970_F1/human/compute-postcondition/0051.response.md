Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element, `elements` is updated such that `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, `index ind` is 0, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`.**

This means that the value of `elements[line[ind]]` has been updated to `(i, ind)`, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
