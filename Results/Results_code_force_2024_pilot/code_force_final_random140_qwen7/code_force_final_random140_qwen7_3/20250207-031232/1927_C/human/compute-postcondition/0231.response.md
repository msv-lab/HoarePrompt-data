Output State: **`i` is 1; `leftOnes` must be greater than 1; `aOnes` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `aOnes` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial unspecified value that must be greater than 1 (let's denote it as `x`). After incrementing, `aOnes` becomes `x + 1`. Since `x` was initially greater than 1, `aOnes` is now at least 2. The values of `i` and `leftOnes` remain unchanged.
