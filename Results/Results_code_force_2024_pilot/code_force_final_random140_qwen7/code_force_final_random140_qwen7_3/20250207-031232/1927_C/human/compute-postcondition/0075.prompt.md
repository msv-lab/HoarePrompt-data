Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `leftOnes` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer that is at least 9 (since the loop runs up to `i` being 5, which means `k` must be at least 5 * 2 - 1 = 9), `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is 2, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i < leftOnes:
    if aOnes < bOnes:
        aOnes += 1
    else:
        bOnes += 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `leftOnes` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer that is at least 9, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is either 3 or 2, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `leftOnes` must be greater than 2; if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is `leftOnes` + 1, otherwise `bOnes` is increased by 1; `i` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `leftOnes` must be greater than 2 and `i` is increased by 1, `i` must be less than `leftOnes`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
