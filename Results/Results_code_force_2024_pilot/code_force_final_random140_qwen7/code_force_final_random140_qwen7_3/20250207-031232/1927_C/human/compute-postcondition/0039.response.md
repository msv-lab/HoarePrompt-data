Postcondition: **`leftOnes` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is at least 3, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 2. Otherwise, `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 1, and `bOnes` is set to 1 if `i` is in `b`; otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0.**
