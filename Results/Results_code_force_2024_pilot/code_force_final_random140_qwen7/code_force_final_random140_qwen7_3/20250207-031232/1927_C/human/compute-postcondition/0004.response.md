Output State: **`leftOnes` is 0, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `leftOnes` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
