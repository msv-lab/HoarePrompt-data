Postcondition: `leftOnes` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is 1 or 0, `bOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, and `i` is either in `a` or not in `a` and `b`.

This means that after executing the if-else block, `leftOnes` remains 0, `n` and `m` retain their original values as the first and second integers entered by the user, `k` remains greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` remain as frozensets of integers entered by the user, and `aOnes` and `bOnes` can each be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is in `a` or `b`.
