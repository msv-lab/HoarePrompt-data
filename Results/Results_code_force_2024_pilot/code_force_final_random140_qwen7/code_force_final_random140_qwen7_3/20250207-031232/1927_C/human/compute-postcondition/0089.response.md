Output State: **`leftOnes` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the third integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 6, `t` is 1, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split.**

Explanation: The code `newk = k // 2` updates the value of `newk` to be the integer division of `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `newk` is now set to `k // 2`, while all other variables retain their initial states.
