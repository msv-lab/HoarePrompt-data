Output State: **`leftOnes` is 1 if `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, otherwise `leftOnes` is 0; `n` is the first integer entered by the user; `m` is the second integer entered by the user; `k` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user; `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split; `aOnes` is either 0 or 1; `bOnes` is either 0 or 1; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` must be less than `k`; `t` is 1; `bOnes` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `bOnes` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
