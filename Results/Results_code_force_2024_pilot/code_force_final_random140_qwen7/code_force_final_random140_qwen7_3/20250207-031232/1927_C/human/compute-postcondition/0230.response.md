Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `while i < leftOnes:`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `leftOnes`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `leftOnes` must be greater than 0.

3. **Condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `leftOnes`. Currently, `i` is 1, so `leftOnes` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `leftOnes` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `leftOnes` is at least 2 (the smallest value greater than 1).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `leftOnes` is at least 2.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `leftOnes` must be greater than 1**
