Output State: **`leftOnes` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` must be at least 5, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using `map` and `input` split, `aOnes` is 2, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The value of `aOnes` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
