Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is a non-negative integer, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are each either 0 or any integer up to `newk`, the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is true, `t` is `t + k * leftOnes`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the same as when the loop started, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`.**
