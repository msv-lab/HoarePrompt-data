Output State: **`i` is 1; `leftOnes` must be greater than 1; `aOnes` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Given that `aOnes` was initially 1 (as derived from the precondition that `i` is 1), after executing `aOnes += 1`, `aOnes` becomes 2. The preconditions that `i` is 1 and `leftOnes` must be greater than 1 remain unchanged.
