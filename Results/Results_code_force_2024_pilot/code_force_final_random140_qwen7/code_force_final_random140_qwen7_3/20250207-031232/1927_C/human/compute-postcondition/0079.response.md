Based on the initial state provided:

- `leftOnes` is explicitly stated to be exactly 5.
- `n` and `m` are integers entered by the user.
- `k` is an integer that is at least 9.
- `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user.
- `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using `map` and `input` split.
- `aOnes` is either 7 or 6.
- `bOnes` is either 0 or 1.
- `newk` is `k // 2`.
- `i` is 6.
- The condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is explicitly stated to be false.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

Given that the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is false, it does not affect the execution of the `print` statement. The `print` statement will simply output the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
