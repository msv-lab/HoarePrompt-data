Output State: **`leftOnes` must be greater than 2 and `i` must be less than `leftOnes`; `aOnes` is `aOnes` + 1.**

Explanation: The value of `aOnes` is incremented by 1. The conditions on `leftOnes` and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `leftOnes` must still be greater than 2 and `i` must still be less than `leftOnes`.
