Postcondition: **`leftOnes` is 1, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` must be at least 1, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2.**

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `i` is found in both sets `a` and `b`, `i` is set to 2 and `leftOnes` is incremented to 1. If `i` is not found in both sets, `i` remains 2, and the other variables retain their previous states.
