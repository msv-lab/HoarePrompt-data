Output State: **`leftOnes` is 0, `i` is equal to 0, `aOnes` is equal to 0, `bOnes` is 0, the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false, `t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `newk = k // 2` assigns the value of `k // 2` (integer division of `k` by 2) to the variable `newk`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
