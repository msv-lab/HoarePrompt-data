To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition `i < leftOnes`.

Given the loop head condition:
- The loop continues as long as `i < leftOnes`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `leftOnes` must be at least 2.
- `i` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `leftOnes`. Since `i` is currently 2, `leftOnes` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `leftOnes`.

State: **`leftOnes` must be greater than 2**
