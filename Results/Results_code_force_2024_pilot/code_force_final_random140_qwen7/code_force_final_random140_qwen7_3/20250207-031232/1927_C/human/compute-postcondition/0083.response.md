Output State: **`leftOnes` must be exactly 5, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the third integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is either 7 or 6, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 6, `t` is 1**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The other variables (`leftOnes`, `a`, `b`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `newk`, `i`, `t`) remain unchanged.
