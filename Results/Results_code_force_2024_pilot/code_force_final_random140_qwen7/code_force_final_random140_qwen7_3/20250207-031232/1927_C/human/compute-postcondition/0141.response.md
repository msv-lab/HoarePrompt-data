Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 1
- `leftOnes` must be greater than 0
- If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` remains 1 and `bOnes` is unchanged.
- Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1 and `aOnes` is at least as large as `bOnes`.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop continues as long as `i < leftOnes`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop condition checks `i < leftOnes`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `leftOnes`.
2. **Adjusting `i`**: Since `i` starts at 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `leftOnes`. After the first iteration, `i` becomes 2 (assuming the loop body increments `i` by 1).
3. **Adjusting `leftOnes`**: For the loop to continue, `leftOnes` must still be greater than `i`. Since `i` is now 2, `leftOnes` must be greater than 2.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `leftOnes` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
- `i` is 2 (since it was incremented from 1)
- `leftOnes` must be greater than 2

Thus, the final state is:

**State: `i` is 2, `leftOnes` must be greater than 2**
