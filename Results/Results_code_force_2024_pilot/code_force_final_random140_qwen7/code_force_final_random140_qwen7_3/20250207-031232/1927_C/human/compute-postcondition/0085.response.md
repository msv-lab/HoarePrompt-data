Output State: **`leftOnes` must be exactly 5, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the third integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is either 7 or 6, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 6, `t` is 1, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split.**

Explanation: The code `b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and creates a frozenset from these integers. This changes the value of `b` to a frozenset of integers entered by the user, while the other variables remain unchanged.
