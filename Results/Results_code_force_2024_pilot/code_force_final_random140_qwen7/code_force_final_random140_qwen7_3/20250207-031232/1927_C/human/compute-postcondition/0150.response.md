Output State: **`i` is 2, `leftOnes` must be greater than 2, if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` remains 2, otherwise `bOnes` is 3**

Explanation: The code `bOnes += 1` increments the value of `bOnes` by 1. Since `bOnes` was initially 2 (from the precondition), after executing the code, `bOnes` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
