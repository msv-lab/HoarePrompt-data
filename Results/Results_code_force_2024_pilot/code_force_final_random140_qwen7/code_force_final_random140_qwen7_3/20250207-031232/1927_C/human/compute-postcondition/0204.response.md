Postcondition: `leftOnes` is either 2, 1, or 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `aOnes` is 2 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 (incremented by 1 if `i` is in `b`), `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false, `t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` must be such that `k` is at least 3, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `i` is not in `b`.
