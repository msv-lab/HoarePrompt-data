Output State: **`leftOnes` must be greater than 2; if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is `leftOnes` + 1, otherwise `bOnes` is increased by 1; `i` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions and values of `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` remain as per their initial postconditions and rules.
