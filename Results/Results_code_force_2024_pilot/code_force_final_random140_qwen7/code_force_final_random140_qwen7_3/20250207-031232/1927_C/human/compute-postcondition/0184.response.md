Output State: **`leftOnes` is 0, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1, the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false, `t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` must be such that `k` is at least 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is in `b`.**

Explanation: The variable `bOnes` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
