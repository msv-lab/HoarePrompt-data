Output State: **`leftOnes` must be greater than 2; `bOnes` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `bOnes` is incremented by 1. The precondition that `leftOnes` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `bOnes` and retains the condition on `leftOnes`.
