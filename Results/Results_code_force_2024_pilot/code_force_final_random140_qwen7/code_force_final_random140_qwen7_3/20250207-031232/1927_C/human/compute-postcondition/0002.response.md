Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user.**

The code creates a frozenset from the integers entered by the user using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `a` now holds a frozenset of integers, while `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
