Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be equal to the total number of test cases, `n`, `m`, and `k` will retain their initial values, `a` and `b` will be frozensets containing the respective integers from the inputs, `leftOnes` will be a non-negative integer representing the count of numbers present in both `a` and `b` within the range `[1, k]`, `aOnes` will be an integer representing the count of numbers present only in `a` within the range `[1, k]`, `bOnes` will be an integer representing the count of numbers present only in `b` within the range `[1, k]`, `newk` will be `k // 2`, and `i` will be equal to `leftOnes`.

The final output will be 'yes' if `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, and 'no' otherwise.
