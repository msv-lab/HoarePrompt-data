Output State: **`leftOnes` is 2 if `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, otherwise `leftOnes` is 1; `aOnes` is increased by 1 if `i` is in `a`; `bOnes` is increased by 1; `n` is the first integer entered by the user; `m` is the second integer entered by the user; `k` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user; `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is increased by 1; `t` is 1; `bOnes` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `bOnes` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
