Output State: **`i` is 1; `leftOnes` must be greater than 1; `bOnes` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `bOnes` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial unspecified value (but known to be at least 1 since `leftOnes` must be greater than 1). Given that `bOnes` was initially at least 1, after the increment, `bOnes` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `leftOnes` remain unchanged.
