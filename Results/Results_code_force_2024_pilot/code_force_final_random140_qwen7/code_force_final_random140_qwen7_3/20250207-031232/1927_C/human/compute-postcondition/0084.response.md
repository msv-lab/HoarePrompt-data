Output State: **`leftOnes` must be exactly 5, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the third integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is either 7 or 6, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 6, `t` is 1, `a` is updated to a frozenset of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a frozenset from these integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
