The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) indicating the number of sub-cases. For each sub-case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the largest and second-largest integers from the list for each sub-case. After processing all sub-cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each sub-case.
