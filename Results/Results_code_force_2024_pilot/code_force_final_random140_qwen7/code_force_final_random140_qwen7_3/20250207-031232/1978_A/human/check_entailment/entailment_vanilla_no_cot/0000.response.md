Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code is flawed because it only considers the largest and second-largest numbers in the list without ensuring that the remaining books are optimally divided into two piles.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that the two piles are formed such that the sum of the maximum values in each pile is maximized. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = sorted(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        # The optimal strategy is to place the largest book in one pile and the second-largest book in the other pile,
        # and then distribute the rest of the books to maximize the sum of the maximums of both piles.
        max_pages = max(ls[-1] + sum(ls[:-1]), ls[-2] + sum(ls[:-2] + [ls[-1]]))
        print(max_pages)

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read the number of books `n` and the list of page counts.
3. Sort the list of page counts.
4. Calculate the maximum possible total number of pages Alice can read by considering the two optimal ways to split the books:
   - Placing the largest book in one pile and the second-largest book in the other pile.
   - Placing the second-largest book in one pile and the largest book in the other pile, ensuring the rest of the books are distributed appropriately.
5. Print the maximum value obtained from these two scenarios.
