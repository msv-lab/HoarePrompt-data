You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = input().split()
        last = int(ls.pop())
        other = int(sorted(ls).pop())
        print(last + other)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        ls = input().split()
        
        last = int(ls.pop())
        
        other = int(sorted(ls).pop())
        
        print(last + other)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings from the input excluding the last element for each iteration, `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls` for the last iteration, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list of `ls` for the last iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
    #- The variable `t` will still hold its initial value as long as it was greater than 0.
    #- The loop counter `i` will be equal to `t - 1`.
    #- The variable `n` will be an integer input for the last iteration of the loop.
    #- The list `ls` will be a list of strings from the inputs excluding the last element for each iteration.
    #- The variable `last` will be the integer value of the last element of the original `ls` from the last iteration.
    #- The variable `other` will be the second largest element in the sorted list of `ls` from the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Test Cases and Books:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page counts `ls`.

2. **Handling Input:**
   - The input list `ls` is split into individual strings, which are then converted to integers.
   - The last element (`last`) is popped from the list, and the second largest element (`other`) is determined by sorting the remaining elements and popping the largest one.

3. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The program calculates the sum of `last` and `other` and prints this sum.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Identifying the Largest and Second Largest Elements:**
   - The approach of popping the last element and then finding the largest of the remaining elements is flawed. This method does not ensure that the largest and second largest elements are from different piles.
   - The correct approach would be to sort the list and take the last two elements, ensuring they are from different piles.

2. **Ensuring Different Piles:**
   - To maximize the number of pages read, we need to ensure that the largest and second largest elements are in different piles. Sorting the list and taking the last two elements ensures this.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle edge cases where all elements are the same, or there are only two elements.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `2 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Actual Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The last two elements are `1` and `1`, so the sum is `1 + 1 = 2`.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `4 2 3 3 1`
  - Expected Output: `4`
  - Actual Output: `4`
  - Explanation: After sorting, the elements are `[1, 2, 3, 3]`. The last two elements are `3` and `3`, but since we need them to be from different piles, we take `3` and `2` (or `3` and `1`), resulting in `3 + 1 = 4`.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `5 2 2 3 2 2`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Actual Output: `5`
  - Explanation: After sorting, the elements are `[2, 2, 2, 2, 3]`. The last two elements are `3` and `2`, resulting in `3 + 2 = 5`.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the largest and second largest elements are from different piles. It simply takes the last two elements after sorting, which may not always result in the correct solution.

Correctness: **False**
