Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now equal to the integer input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    ls = input().split()
    last = int(ls.pop())
    other = int(sorted(ls).pop())
    print(last + other)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list without its last element, `last` is the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest element in the original `ls`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace, `ls` is a list of strings split from the input (excluding the last element), `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest element in the original `ls` before sorting, `other` is now the second largest element in the sorted list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings from the input excluding the last element, `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list of `ls`, `ls` is updated to a list of strings from the input excluding the last element, `other` is the second largest integer in the sorted list of `ls` before removing the last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
