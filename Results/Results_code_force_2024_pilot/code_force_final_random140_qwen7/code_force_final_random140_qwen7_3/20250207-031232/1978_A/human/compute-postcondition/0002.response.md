Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input().strip())` reads an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer. The value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `i` is still 0, and `n` is set to the integer value of the input provided by the user.
