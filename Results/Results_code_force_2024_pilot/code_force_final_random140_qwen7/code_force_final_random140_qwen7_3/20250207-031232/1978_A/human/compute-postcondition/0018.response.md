Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ls` is a list of strings from the input excluding the last element.
- `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`.
- `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list of `ls` before removing the last element.
- `ls` is updated to a list of strings from the input excluding the last element.
- `other` is the second largest integer in the sorted list of `ls` after removing the last element.

The print statement is `print(last + other)`. Here, `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`, and `other` is the second largest integer in the sorted list of `ls` after removing the last element.

Since `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`, and `other` is the second largest integer in the sorted list of `ls` after removing the last element, the expression `last + other` calculates the sum of these two values.

Output: **last + other (where last is the integer value of the last element of the original ls and other is the second largest integer in the sorted list of ls after removing the last element)**
