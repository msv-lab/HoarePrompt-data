Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list without its last element, `last` is the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest element in the original `ls`, `n` is the integer input stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.**

The code `n = int(input().strip())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. It also strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input before converting it to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
