Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace, `ls` is a list of strings split from the input, `last` is the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest element in the original `ls`.**

Explanation: The code `ls = input().split()` takes the input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to `ls`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `last`, and `other`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is now the input integer stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
