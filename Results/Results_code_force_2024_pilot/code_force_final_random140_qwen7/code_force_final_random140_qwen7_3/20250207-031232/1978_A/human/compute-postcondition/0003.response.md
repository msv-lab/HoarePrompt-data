Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `ls = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `ls`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `n` remains as an input integer since no operation was performed on it.
