Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop condition).
   - `ls` is a list without its last element.
   - `last` is the last element of the original `ls`.
   - `other` is the second largest element in the original `ls`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged but must still be greater than 0.

6. **Other variables (`n`, `ls`, `last`, `other`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again**.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list without its last element, `last` is the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest element in the original `ls`**.
