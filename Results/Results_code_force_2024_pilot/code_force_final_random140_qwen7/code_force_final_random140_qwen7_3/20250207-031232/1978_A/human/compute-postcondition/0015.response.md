Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings split from the input (excluding the last element), `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list, `ls` is updated to a list of strings from the input excluding the last element.**

Explanation: The code `ls = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to the variable `ls`. The last element of the original `ls` is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `last`. The second largest element in the sorted list is calculated and assigned to the variable `other`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
