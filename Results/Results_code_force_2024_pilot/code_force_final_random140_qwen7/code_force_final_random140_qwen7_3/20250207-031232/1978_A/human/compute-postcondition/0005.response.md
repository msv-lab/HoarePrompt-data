Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list without its last element, `last` is the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest element in the original `ls`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `ls` and removes the smallest element (which is now the first element after sorting), assigning it to `other`. Since `ls` originally had `last` as its last element, and assuming `last` was not the smallest, `other` will be the second largest element in the original list. All other variables remain unchanged.
