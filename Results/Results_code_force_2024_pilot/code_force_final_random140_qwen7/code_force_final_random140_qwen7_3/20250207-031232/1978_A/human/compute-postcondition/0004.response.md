Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list without the last element, `last` is the last element of the original `ls`.**

Explanation: The code `last = int(ls.pop())` pops the last element from the list `ls` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `last`. The list `ls` is modified and no longer contains its last element. All other variables remain unchanged.
