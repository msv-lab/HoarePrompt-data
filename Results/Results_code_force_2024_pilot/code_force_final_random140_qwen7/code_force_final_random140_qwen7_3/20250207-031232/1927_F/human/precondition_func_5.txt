t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n⋅(n - 1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), and u, v, and w are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. The graph is represented by a dictionary `graph` where `graph[u]` is a list of tuples `(v, w)` representing edges from vertex u to vertex v with weight w. The variable `dsu` is an instance of a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure initialized with n+1 sets. The variable `edges` is a list of tuples sorted in reverse order by weight, where each tuple contains (w, u, v).
