You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n⋅(n - 1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), and u, v, and w are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. The graph is represented by a dictionary `graph` where `graph[u]` is a list of tuples `(v, w)` representing edges from vertex u to vertex v with weight w. The variable `dsu` is an instance of a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure initialized with n+1 sets. The variable `edges` is a list of tuples sorted in reverse order by weight, where each tuple contains (w, u, v).
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `m` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed; `graph[v]` will include all `u` values returned by `func_3()` for each iteration; `edges` will contain tuples `(w, u, v)` for each iteration, where `w` is the weight, `u` is the source vertex, and `v` is the destination vertex; `u` and `v` will be the last two values returned by `func_3()` during the loop's final iteration; `w` will be the weight of the edge corresponding to the last call to `func_3()` during the loop's final iteration.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    start = -1
    end = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            _min_edge = w
            start = u
            end = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v)
        
    #State: All nodes have been processed through the union-find operations, and the variables `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` reflect the minimum edge that causes a cycle in the graph, along with the nodes involved in that cycle.
    que = deque([start])
    prev = {start: -1}
    while que:
        node = que.popleft()
        
        if node == end:
            break
        
        for nei in graph[node]:
            if node == start and nei == end:
                continue
            if nei not in prev:
                prev[nei] = node
                que.append(nei)
        
    #State: Output State: The deque `que` will contain all nodes that can be reached from the starting node `start` to the ending node `end`, forming the shortest path from `start` to `end` if such a path exists. If multiple paths exist, `que` will contain one such path. The dictionary `prev` will store the predecessor of each node in this path, except for the starting node `start`, which will have a value of `-1` in `prev`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `que` will hold a list of nodes representing the shortest path from the starting node to the ending node, and `prev` will map each node in this path (except the start node) to its immediate predecessor in the path.
    path = []
    curr = end
    while curr != -1:
        path.append(curr)
        
        curr = prev[curr]
        
    #State: Output State: `que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, `path` is a list containing the full shortest path from `start` to `end`, and `curr` is `-1`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `curr` will eventually become `-1` because the loop continues as long as `curr` is not equal to `-1`. During each iteration of the loop, `curr` is set to the immediate predecessor of its current value in the path, and `curr` is appended to the `path` list. This process continues until `curr` reaches `start`, at which point the loop terminates. At this point, `path` contains the full shortest path from `start` to `end`, and `curr` is set to `-1`. The `que` and `prev` variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    print(_min_edge, len(path))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(path)
    print(*path[::-1])
    #This is printed: the full shortest path from end to start, with nodes separated by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but uses pre-defined variables `t`, `graph`, `dsu`, and `edges`. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it checks if a path exists between any two vertices `u` and `v` in a weighted graph using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure, considering the edges sorted by weight in descending order. If a path exists, it returns "Yes", otherwise, it returns "No" for each test case.
