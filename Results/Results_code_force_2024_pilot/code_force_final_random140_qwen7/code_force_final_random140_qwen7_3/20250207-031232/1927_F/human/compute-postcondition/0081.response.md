Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, `node`, and the next `nei`; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, there is no loop being iterated over, so the `continue` statement does not change any of the variables or the state of `que` or `prev`. Therefore, the state remains the same as the initial state.
