Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(test_cases)`. The only variable mentioned here is `_`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 1.
   - `_` is 1 (though this is not relevant for adjusting the state).
   - The function `func_6()` has been called.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `test_cases` was greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be greater than 0 for the next iteration unless it is decremented or modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `test_cases`, which must remain greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
