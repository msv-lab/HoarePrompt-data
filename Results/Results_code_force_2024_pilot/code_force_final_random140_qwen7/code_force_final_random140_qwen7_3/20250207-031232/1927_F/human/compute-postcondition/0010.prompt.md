You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 * 10^5), and m represents the number of edges in the graph. Each of the next m lines contains three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices and the graph is not necessarily connected.
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: Output State: `test_cases` must be a positive integer, `_` is equal to `test_cases - 1`, and the function `func_6()` has been called `test_cases` times.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `test_cases` must still be a positive integer (since it started as one and hasn't been modified inside the loop), the loop variable `_` will be equal to `test_cases - 1` (as it increments with each iteration), and the function `func_6()` will have been called exactly `test_cases` times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers n and m, where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 * 10^5), and m represents the number of edges in the graph. Additionally, for each of the next m lines, it accepts three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the graph data for each test case according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
