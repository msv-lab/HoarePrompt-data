Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers n and m, where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 * 10^5), and m represents the number of edges in the graph. Additionally, for each of the next m lines, it accepts three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the graph data for each test case according to the given constraints.**
