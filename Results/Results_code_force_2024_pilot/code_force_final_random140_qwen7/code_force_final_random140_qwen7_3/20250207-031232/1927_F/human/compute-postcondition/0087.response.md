Output State: The deque `que` will contain the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and all nodes that are part of the path from `start` to `end` (or as far as the loop can traverse), with each node's predecessor stored in the dictionary `prev`. The loop continues to append neighbors of the current node to `que` and update `prev` unless the current node is `start` and the neighbor is `end`, in which case it skips that iteration.

In simpler terms, `que` will hold a list of nodes representing a path from the starting node (`start`) to either the ending node (`end`) or the farthest reachable node, and `prev` will map each node in this path (except the start node) to its immediate predecessor in the path.
