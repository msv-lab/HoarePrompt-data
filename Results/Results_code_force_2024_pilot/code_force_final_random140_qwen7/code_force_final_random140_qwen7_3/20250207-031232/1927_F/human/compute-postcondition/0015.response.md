Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `graph[u]` now includes `v`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)`, `(w, u, v)`, and the new `(w, u, v)` from `func_3()`, `u` is the first return value from `func_3()`, `v` is the second return value from `func_3()`, `w` is the third return value from `func_3()`**

Explanation: The code appends `v` to the list `graph[u]`. Since `u` is the first return value from `func_3()`, `v` is the second return value from `func_3()`, and `w` is the third return value from `func_3()`, the list `graph[u]` will now include `v`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
