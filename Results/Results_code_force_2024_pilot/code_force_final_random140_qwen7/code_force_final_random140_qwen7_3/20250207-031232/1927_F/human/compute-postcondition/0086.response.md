Output State: The deque `que` will contain the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and all the nodes that can be reached from `start` following the path defined by `prev`, until it reaches `end`. Additionally, for each node `nei` added to `que`, `prev[nei]` will be set to the previous node that led to `nei`.

In simpler terms, `que` will hold a list of nodes starting from `start` to `end`, with each node's predecessor stored in `prev`, forming a path from `start` to `end` if such a path exists. If no such path exists, `que` will still contain all reachable nodes from `start` up to the point where no further neighbors are added to `que`.
