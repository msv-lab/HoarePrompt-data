Output State: **`node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node` in the graph, and `nei` is not in `prev`; `que` now contains the first neighbor of `node`, which is `nei`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the `nei` (first neighbor of `node`) to the list `que`. Since `nei` was already a neighbor of `node` and not in `prev`, appending it to `que` adds it to the queue. All other variables remain unchanged.
