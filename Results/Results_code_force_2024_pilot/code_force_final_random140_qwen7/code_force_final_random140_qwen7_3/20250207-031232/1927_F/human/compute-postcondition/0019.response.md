Output State: **After sorting `edges` in reverse order, `m` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed; `graph[v]` will include all `u` values returned by `func_3()` for each iteration; `edges` will now contain tuples `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order; `u` and `v` will be the last two values returned by `func_3()` during the loop's final iteration; `w` will be the weight of the edge corresponding to the last call to `func_3()` during the loop's final iteration.**

This means that the `edges` list, which originally contained tuples of weights, sources, and destinations, has been sorted in descending order based on the weights. All other variables (`m`, `graph[v]`, `u`, and `v`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
