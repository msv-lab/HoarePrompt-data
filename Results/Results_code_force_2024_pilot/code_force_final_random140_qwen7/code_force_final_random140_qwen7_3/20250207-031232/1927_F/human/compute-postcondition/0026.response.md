Output State: **`parent_v` is the root of node `v` found using the dsu find method, `_min_edge` is infinity, `start` is -1, `end` is -1, `parent_u` is the root of node `u` found using the dsu find method.**

Explanation: The code assigns the root of node `v` to the variable `parent_v` using the `dsu.find(v)` method. This changes the value of `parent_v`, while the other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
