Output State: **`nei` is an element of `graph[node]` that is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `que` now contains `[node, nei, nei]`. We continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. However, since no specific loop was mentioned in the initial state, the variables `nei`, `prev`, and `que` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement itself does not alter these variables but indicates that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.
