Output State: **Postcondition: `node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the last neighbor of `node` in the graph that has not been processed yet, and `prev` contains mappings of all nodes in `que` except the first one to their respective predecessors. `que` contains all nodes from the initial graph except for the first one in `que`, and the process continues until either the end node is reached or there are no more neighbors to process.**

In this final state, `node` will always be the first element in `que`, and `nei` will be the last neighbor of `node` that has not been processed yet. The dictionary `prev` will map each node in `que` (except the first one) to its predecessor. The queue `que` will contain all nodes from the initial graph except for the first one, and the loop will continue processing until either the end node is reached (in which case the condition `node == start and nei == end` would have been met), or there are no more neighbors to process.
