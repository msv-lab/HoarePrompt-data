Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, and the function `func_6()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_6()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within this function call, the values of `test_cases` and `_` remain unchanged. The fact that `func_6()` has been called is noted, but no specific details about what the function does are provided, so we cannot alter the state further.
