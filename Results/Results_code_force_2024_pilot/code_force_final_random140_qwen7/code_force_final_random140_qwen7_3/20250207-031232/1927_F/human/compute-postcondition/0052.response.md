Output State: **All nodes have been processed through the union-find operations, and the variables `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` reflect the minimum edge that causes a cycle in the graph, along with the nodes involved in that cycle.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the following conditions will hold:
- All edges in the `edges` collection have been processed.
- The `dsu` (Disjoint Set Union) data structure has united all connected components of the graph.
- The variable `_min_edge` holds the weight of the minimum edge that forms a cycle in the graph (i.e., the edge that connects two nodes already in the same connected component).
- The variables `start` and `end` hold the nodes that are part of the cycle formed by `_min_edge`.
- If no cycle was detected during the loop's execution, `_min_edge` will still be `infinity`, and `start` and `end` will remain `-1`.
