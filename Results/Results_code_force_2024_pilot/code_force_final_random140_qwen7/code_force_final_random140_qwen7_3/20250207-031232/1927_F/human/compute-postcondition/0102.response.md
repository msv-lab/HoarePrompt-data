Output State: **`node` is the first element of `que`, `nei` is equal to `node`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `que` now contains `[node, nei]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the variable `nei` (which is equal to `node`) to the list `que`. Initially, `que` contains only the first element `node`. After appending `nei`, `que` now contains both `node` and `nei`. All other variables remain unchanged.
