Output State: **`dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `m` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed, `graph[v]` will include all `u` values returned by `func_3()` for each iteration, `edges` will now contain tuples `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order, `u` and `v` will be the last two values returned by `func_3()` during the loop's final iteration, `w` will be the weight of the edge corresponding to the last call to `func_3()` during the loop's final iteration.**

The code initializes a `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) object named `dsu` with `n + 1` elements. This initialization does not affect the values of `m`, `graph[v]`, `edges`, `u`, `v`, and `w`, which remain as described in the initial state.
