Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while que:`. This means the loop will continue as long as the deque `que` is not empty.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `que` is a deque containing the value of `start`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remains unchanged.
   - `prev` is a dictionary with key `start` and value `-1`.

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - The only object involved in the loop condition is `que`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `que` must not be empty.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `que` must not be empty for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `que` contains at least one element.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `que` is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`que` is a deque containing the value of `start`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remains unchanged; `prev` is a dictionary with key `start` and value `-1`, and `que` must not be empty**.
