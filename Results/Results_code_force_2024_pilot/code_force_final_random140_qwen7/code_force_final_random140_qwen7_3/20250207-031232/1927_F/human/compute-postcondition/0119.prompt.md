Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `que` is now a deque without its first element, `node` is the first element that was removed from `que`. If `node` equals `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the only outcome is that if `node` equals `end`, the loop or if statement is exited.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `nei` remains uninitialized. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `nei` is set to `node` and `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `que` now contains `[node, nei]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nei` is an element of `graph[node]` that is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `que` now contains `[node, nei, nei]`. If `node` is `start` and `nei` is `end`, we continue the loop. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `que` now contains `[node, nei, nei, nei]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
