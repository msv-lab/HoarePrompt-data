Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _min_edge is infinity, start is -1, end is -1
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        _min_edge = w
        start = u
        end = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `parent_v` is the root of node `v`, `_min_edge` is either `w` (if `parent_u` equals `parent_v`), or remains `infinity` (if `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`). `start` is either `u` (if `parent_u` equals `parent_v`), or remains `-1` (if `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`). `end` is either `v` (if `parent_u` equals `parent_v`), or remains `-1` (if `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`). `parent_u` is now equal to `parent_v` (if `parent_u` equals `parent_v`), or remains unchanged (if `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection, `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then `start` is `u`, `_min_edge` is `w`, and `end` is `v`. Otherwise, the union operation between nodes `u` and `v` has been performed in the DSU structure.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection, `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` is `w`, `start` is `u`, and `end` is `v`. Otherwise, `parent_v` is updated to `dsu.find(v)`, and the union operation between `u` and `v` has been performed in the DSU structure.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
