Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `node` where `node` is a valid node in the graph and `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor, and the current value of `node` is equal to `start` and the current value of `nei` (neighbor) is equal to `end`. We continue the loop or process.**

The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values but instead moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `que`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `node`, and `nei` remain unchanged from their initial states.
