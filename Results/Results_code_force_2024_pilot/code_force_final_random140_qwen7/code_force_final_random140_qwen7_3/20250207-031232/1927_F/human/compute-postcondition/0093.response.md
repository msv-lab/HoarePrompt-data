Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `node` and `nei`.
2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each neighbor (`nei`) of the current node (`node`) in the graph.
3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `node`: This variable represents the current node being processed. It should be initialized to the starting node of the traversal.
   - `nei`: This variable will take on the value of each neighbor of `node` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the postcondition that `que` is now a deque without its first element and `node` is the first element that was removed from `que`, we can infer that `node` should be set to the first element of `que`.

Therefore, the initial state before the loop starts should include:
- `node` being set to the first element of `que`.
- `nei` being an uninitialized variable (since it will be assigned values during the loop).

So, the state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`node` is the first element of `que`, `nei` is an uninitialized variable**
