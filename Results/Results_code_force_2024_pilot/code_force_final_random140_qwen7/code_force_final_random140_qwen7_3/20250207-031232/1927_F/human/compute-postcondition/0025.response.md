Output State: **_min_edge is infinity, `start` is -1, `end` is -1, `edges` must be a non-empty iterable, `parent_u` is the root of node `u` found using the dsu find method.**

The code `parent_u = dsu.find(u)` finds the root of node `u` in the disjoint set union (DSU) data structure. This operation does not change the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`, or `edges`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values, and only `parent_u` is updated to the root of node `u`.
