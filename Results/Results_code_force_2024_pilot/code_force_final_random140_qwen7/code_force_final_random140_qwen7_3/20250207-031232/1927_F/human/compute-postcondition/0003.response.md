Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and the function call `range(test_cases)`. The key variables here are `test_cases` and `_`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `test_cases`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and the function `func_6()` has been called.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `_` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than `test_cases`. Therefore, `test_cases` must still be greater than 1 (since `_` is now 1).

5. **Final state**: After the first iteration, the state should be adjusted accordingly.

**State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, and the function `func_6()` has been called.**
