Output State: `que` is a deque that initially contained multiple elements, but after all iterations of the loop, it is now empty. `node` is the last element that was removed from `que`. `prev` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents a node and its predecessor in the path from `start` to `end`, forming a valid path through the graph. The loop continues to append nodes to `que` as long as they are not already in `prev` and do not form a direct cycle (i.e., `node` is `start` and `nei` is `end`). Once `que` is empty, the loop terminates, and `node` holds the last node processed.

In simpler terms, `que` is now empty because all reachable nodes have been processed, `node` is the final node examined, and `prev` contains the path from `start` to `end` if such a path exists.
