Postcondition: `que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `node`, and now also contains `nei`; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `nei` is a neighbor of `node` and not in `prev`; if the current value of `node` is equal to `start` and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`, we continue the loop or process. Otherwise, the deque remains unchanged.
