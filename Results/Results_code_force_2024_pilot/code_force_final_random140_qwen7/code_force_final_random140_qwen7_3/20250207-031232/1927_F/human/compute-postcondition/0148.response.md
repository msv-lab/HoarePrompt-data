Output State: **`node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph, `prev[nei]` is now assigned the value of `node`, `que` now contains the elements `[node, nei]`, and if `node` is the `start` and `nei` is the `end`, the condition is met and the loop continues. If the condition `node == start and nei == end` is not met, the condition remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `prev[nei] = node` assigns the value of `node` to `prev[nei]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial states.
