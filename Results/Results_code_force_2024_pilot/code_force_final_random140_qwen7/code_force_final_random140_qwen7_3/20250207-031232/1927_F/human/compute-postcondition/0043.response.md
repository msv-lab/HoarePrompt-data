Postcondition: **`w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection, `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then `start` is `u`, `_min_edge` is `w`, and `end` is `v`. Otherwise, the union operation between nodes `u` and `v` has been performed in the DSU structure.**
