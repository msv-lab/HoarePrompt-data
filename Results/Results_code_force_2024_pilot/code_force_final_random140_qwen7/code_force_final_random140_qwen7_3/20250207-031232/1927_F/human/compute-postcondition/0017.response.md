Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `graph[v]` now includes `u`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)`, `(w, u, v)`, and the new `(w, u, v)` from `func_3()`, `u` is the first return value from `func_3()`, `v` is the second return value from `func_3()`, `w` is the third return value from `func_3()`, `edges` now includes an additional tuple `(w, u, v)`**.

This means that the `edges` list has been updated to include one more tuple `(w, u, v)` which is the result of the `func_3()` call. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
