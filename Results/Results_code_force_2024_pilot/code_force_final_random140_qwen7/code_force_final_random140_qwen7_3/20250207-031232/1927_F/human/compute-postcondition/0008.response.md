Output State: `test_cases` must be a positive integer, `_` is equal to `test_cases - 1`, and the function `func_6()` has been called `test_cases` times.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `test_cases` must still be a positive integer (since it started as one and hasn't been modified inside the loop), the loop variable `_` will be equal to `test_cases - 1` (as it increments with each iteration), and the function `func_6()` will have been called exactly `test_cases` times.
