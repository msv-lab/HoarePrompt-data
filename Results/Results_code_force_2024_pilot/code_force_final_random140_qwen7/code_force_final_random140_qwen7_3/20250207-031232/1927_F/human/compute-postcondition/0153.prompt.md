Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `que` is a deque containing the value of `start`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remains unchanged; `prev` is a dictionary with key `start` and value `-1`.
Code of the loop:
while que:
    node = que.popleft()
    if node == end:
        break
    for nei in graph[node]:
        if node == start and nei == end:
            continue
        if nei not in prev:
            prev[nei] = node
            que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The deque `que` will contain the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and all nodes that are part of the path from `start` to `end` (or as far as the loop can traverse), with each node's predecessor stored in the dictionary `prev`. The loop continues to append neighbors of the current node to `que` and update `prev` unless the current node is `start` and the neighbor is `end`, in which case it skips that iteration.

In simpler terms, `que` will hold a list of nodes representing a path from the starting node (`start`) to either the ending node (`end`) or the farthest reachable node, and `prev` will map each node in this path (except the start node) to its immediate predecessor in the path.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `que` is a deque containing all nodes that can be reached from `start` through a series of steps, with each node's predecessor stored in `prev`. The loop has executed until no more nodes can be added to `que` without revisiting previously added nodes.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the last neighbor of `node` in the graph that has not been processed yet, and `prev` contains mappings of all nodes in `que` except the first one to their respective predecessors. `que` contains all nodes from the initial graph except for the first one in `que`, and the process continues until either the end node is reached or there are no more neighbors to process.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
