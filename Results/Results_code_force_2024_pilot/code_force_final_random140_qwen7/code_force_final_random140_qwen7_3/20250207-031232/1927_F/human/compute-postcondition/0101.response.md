Output State: **`node` is the first element of `que`, `nei` is initialized to `node`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`.**

Explanation: The code `prev[nei] = node` initializes `nei` (if it was not already initialized) to `node` and sets the value of `prev[nei]` to `node`. The initial conditions that `node` is the first element of `que` and `nei` remains uninitialized (if it was not already initialized) are preserved.
