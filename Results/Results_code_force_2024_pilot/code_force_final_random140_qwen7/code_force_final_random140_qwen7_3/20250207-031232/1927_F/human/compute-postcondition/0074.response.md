Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `node`, and now also contains `nei`; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `nei` is a neighbor of `node` and not in `prev`; the loop continues.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables within the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the statement was executed. The loop continues its execution from the next iteration.
