Output State: **_min_edge is w, `w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection, `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the disjoint set union (DSU) structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `w` to `_min_edge`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
