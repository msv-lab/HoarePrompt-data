Output State: **`prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `que` now contains `[node, nei]`.**

Explanation: The code `prev[nei] = node` updates the value of `prev[nei]` to be `node`. The condition for continuing the loop based on `node` being `start` and `nei` being `end` is not specified to be checked within the given code snippet, so we assume it remains unchanged. The queue `que` is updated to contain `[node, nei]` after the assignment.
