Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over `nei` in `graph[node]`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nei` is an element of `graph[node]` that is not in `prev`.
   - `prev[nei]` is set to `node`.
   - `que` now contains `[node, nei, nei]`.
   - If `node` is `start` and `nei` is `end`, we continue the loop. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop continues if `node` is `start` and `nei` is `end`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the condition `node` is `start` and `nei` is `end`, we need to ensure these conditions are met for the next iteration.
   - If these conditions are met, the loop will continue, and we need to update the states accordingly.

Given that the loop continues if `node` is `start` and `nei` is `end`, we need to ensure that these conditions are still valid for the next iteration. However, since the loop is iterating over `nei` in `graph[node]`, the values of `node` and `nei` will change in each iteration.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `nei` will be the next element from `graph[node]`.
   - `prev[nei]` will be set to the current `node`.
   - `que` will contain the updated sequence `[current_node, current_nei, current_nei]`.

Since the loop continues based on the specific condition `node` is `start` and `nei` is `end`, we need to ensure these conditions are met for the next iteration. If they are not met, the loop will terminate.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
- `nei` will be the next element from `graph[node]`.
- `prev[nei]` will be set to the current `node`.
- `que` will contain the updated sequence `[current_node, current_nei, current_nei]`.

However, since the exact values of `node` and `nei` will change, we cannot specify them explicitly without knowing the exact values from the previous iteration. We can only describe the general state.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nei` is an element of `graph[node]` that is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `que` now contains `[node, nei, nei]`**.
