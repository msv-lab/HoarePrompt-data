Output State: **_min_edge is w, parent_u is the root of node u found using the dsu find method, parent_v is the root of node v found using the dsu find method, start is u, end is v**.

The code `end = v` assigns the value of `v` to the variable `end`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
