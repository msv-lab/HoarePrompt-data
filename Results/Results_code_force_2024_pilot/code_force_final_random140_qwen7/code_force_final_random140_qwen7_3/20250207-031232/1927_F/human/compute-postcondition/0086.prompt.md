Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge` and `start`; if the current value of `node` (which was at the front of `que` before removal) is equal to `end`, then the function does nothing.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `node`, and now also contains `nei`; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `nei` is a neighbor of `node` and not in `prev`; if the current value of `node` is equal to `start` and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`, we continue the loop or process. Otherwise, the deque remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, `node`, and `nei`; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, `node`, and the next `nei`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` now also contains `nei`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
