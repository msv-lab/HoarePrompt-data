Output State: **`w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection, `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the disjoint set union (DSU) structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure, and the union operation between nodes `u` and `v` has been performed in the DSU structure.**

The `dsu.union(u, v)` operation unites the sets containing nodes `u` and `v` in the DSU structure. This means that `parent_u` and `parent_v` may now point to the same root node, depending on which node's set was merged into the other. However, the specific values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` are not altered by this operation; they are updated internally by the DSU algorithm to reflect the new structure. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
