Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `nei` which iterates over the neighbors of `node` in the `graph`.

2. **Understand the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `node`, and now also contains `nei`.
   - `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.
   - `nei` is a neighbor of `node` and not in `prev`.
   - If the current value of `node` is equal to `start` and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`, we continue the loop or process. Otherwise, the deque remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if there are more neighbors of `node` to process.
   - The state of `node` and `prev` will be updated based on the current iteration.
   - The deque `que` will be modified to include the new `nei` and update the `prev` dictionary.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `node`: Remains the same as it is not being updated in the loop body.
- `prev[nei]`: Updated to the current value of `node`.
- `que`: Modified to include the new `nei`.

Since the loop continues if the current value of `node` is equal to `start` and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`, we need to ensure these conditions are met for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `node`, and now also contains `nei`; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `nei` is a neighbor of `node` and not in `prev`; if the current value of `node` is equal to `start` and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`, we continue the loop or process. Otherwise, the deque remains unchanged.**
