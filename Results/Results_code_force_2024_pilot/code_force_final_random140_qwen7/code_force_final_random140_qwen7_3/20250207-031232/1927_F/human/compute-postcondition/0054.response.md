Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the value of `start`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remains unchanged; `prev` is a dictionary with key `start` and value `-1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a dictionary `prev` with a single key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `-1`. This does not affect the values of `que`, `_min_edge`, or `end`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
