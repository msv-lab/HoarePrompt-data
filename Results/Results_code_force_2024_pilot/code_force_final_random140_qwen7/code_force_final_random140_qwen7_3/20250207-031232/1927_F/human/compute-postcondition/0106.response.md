Output State: **`nei` is an element of `graph[node]` that is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `que` now contains `[node, nei]` and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `nei`, `prev`, or `que`, their states remain the same as the initial state. The loop continues its execution from the next iteration.
