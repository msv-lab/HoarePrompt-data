Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is iterating over `nei` for each `node` in `graph[node]`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `node`, `nei`, and `graph`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are neighbors (`nei`) for the current node.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**: After the loop body (which is omitted), the state of `que` changes based on whether `nei` is in `prev` or not. However, the key variables that need adjustment are `node` and `nei` since they are the ones being iterated over.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - `node` remains the same as it was at the start of the current iteration.
   - `nei` will be the next neighbor of `node` in the graph.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `node` stays the same because the loop is iterating over its neighbors.
   - `nei` becomes the next neighbor of `node`.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next neighbor being processed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph**
