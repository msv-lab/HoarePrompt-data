State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the `for` loop and is automatically assigned values from the `range(test_cases)` function. It starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
- The variable `test_cases` determines whether the loop can execute. For the loop to run, `test_cases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- Since the loop head assigns values to `_`, we don't need to adjust the state of `_` explicitly; it will be set to 0 initially and incremented with each iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `test_cases` to ensure it is greater than 0, and `_` is set to 0 at the start of the loop.
