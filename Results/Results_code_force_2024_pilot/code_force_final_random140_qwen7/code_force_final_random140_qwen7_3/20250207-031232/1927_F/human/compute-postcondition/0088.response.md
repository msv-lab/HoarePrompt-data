The loop head contains the condition `que`, which determines whether the loop can execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `que` is not empty for the loop to continue.

Given that `que` contains a list of nodes representing a path from the starting node (`start`) to either the ending node (`end`) or the farthest reachable node, and considering the loop continues to append neighbors of the current node to `que` and update `prev`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `que`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `que` must not be empty. Since the problem does not provide specific details about the contents of `que` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only ensure that `que` is non-empty.

State: **The deque `que` must not be empty**
