Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `graph[v]` now includes `u` and the new `u` from `func_3()`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)`, `(w, u, v)`, and the new `(w, u, v)` from `func_3()`, `u` is the first return value from `func_3()`, `v` is the second return value from `func_3()`, `w` is the third return value from `func_3()`**.

This output state reflects that the variables `i`, `graph[v]`, `edges`, `u`, `v`, and `w` have been updated by calling `func_3()` again. The value of `i` is incremented by 2 since `i` was initially `i_prev + 1`. The `graph[v]` and `edges` lists are updated to include the new values returned by `func_3()`.
