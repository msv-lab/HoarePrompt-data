Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `que` contains all its original nodes except for the first one, which is now stored in `node'. If `node` equals `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs in `que`.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node` in the graph, and after executing the if-else block, if `nei` is not in `prev`, `que` will contain `nei`. If `nei` is in `prev`, `que` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph, and `prev[nei]` is either assigned the value of `node` or remains unchanged. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`, and `que` now contains the elements `[node, nei]`. If `nei` is already in `prev`, the state of `node` and `nei` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph, `prev[nei]` is now assigned the value of `node`, `que` now contains the elements `[node, nei, nei]`, and if `node` is the `start` and `nei` is the `end`, the condition is met and the loop continues. If the condition `node == start and nei == end` is not met, the condition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
