Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but uses pre-defined variables `t`, `graph`, `dsu`, and `edges`. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it checks if a path exists between any two vertices `u` and `v` in a weighted graph using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure, considering the edges sorted by weight in descending order. If a path exists, it returns "Yes", otherwise, it returns "No" for each test case.**

This functionality describes a function that iterates over a specified number of test cases (`t`), each involving a weighted graph defined by `graph`, and uses a DSU to determine if there is a path between any two given vertices `u` and `v` for each edge in `edges`. The function returns "Yes" if a path exists and "No" if it does not for each test case.
