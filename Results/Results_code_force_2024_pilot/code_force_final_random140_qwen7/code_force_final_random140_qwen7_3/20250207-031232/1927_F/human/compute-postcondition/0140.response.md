Output State: **`node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph, `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.**

The code `prev[nei] = node` assigns the value of `node` to `prev[nei]`. The conditions for continuing the loop (`node == start and nei == end`) remain unchanged, so the states of `node` and `nei` stay the same. The only new information is that `prev[nei]` now holds the value of `node`.
