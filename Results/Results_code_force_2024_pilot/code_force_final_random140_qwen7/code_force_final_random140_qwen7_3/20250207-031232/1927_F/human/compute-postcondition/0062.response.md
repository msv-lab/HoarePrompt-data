Postcondition: `que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `node` where `node` is a valid node in the graph and `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor. `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` (which is not mentioned in the precondition but is implied to be a neighbor of `node`) is equal to `end`.
