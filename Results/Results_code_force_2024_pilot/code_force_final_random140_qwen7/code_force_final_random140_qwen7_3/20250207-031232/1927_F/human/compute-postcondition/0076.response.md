Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `node`, and now also contains `nei`; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `nei` is a neighbor of `node` and not in `prev`.**

Explanation: The code `prev[nei] = node` assigns the value of `node` to `prev[nei]`. This updates the `prev` dictionary such that the key `nei` points to `node`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
