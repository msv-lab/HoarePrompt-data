Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `node`; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `nei` is a neighbor of `node` and not in `prev`; if the current value of `node` is equal to `start` and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`, we continue the loop or process. Otherwise, the deque remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the `prev` dictionary has been updated such that the key `nei` now points to `node`. All other conditions and relationships remain as stated in the initial state.
