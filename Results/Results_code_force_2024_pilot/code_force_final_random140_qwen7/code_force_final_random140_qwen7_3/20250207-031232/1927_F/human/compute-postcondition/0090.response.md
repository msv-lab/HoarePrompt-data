Output State: **`que` is now a deque without its first element, `node` is the first element that was removed from `que`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `que` and `node`. It simply indicates that the program would exit the current loop or conditional block if one were present. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
