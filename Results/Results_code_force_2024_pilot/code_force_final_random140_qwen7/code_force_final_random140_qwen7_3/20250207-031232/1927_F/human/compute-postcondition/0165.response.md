Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, `path` is a list containing `end` followed by `curr`, `curr` is now the immediate predecessor of `curr` in the path.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to its immediate predecessor in the path by using the `prev` dictionary. The other variables (`que`, `prev`, and `path`) remain unchanged.
