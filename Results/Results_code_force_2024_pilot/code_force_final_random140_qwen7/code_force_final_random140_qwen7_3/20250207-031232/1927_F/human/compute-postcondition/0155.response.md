Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, and `path` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `path`. This does not affect the values of `que` or `prev`. Therefore, `que` still contains the shortest path from `start` to `end`, and `prev` still maps each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor. The only change is that `path` is now an empty list.
