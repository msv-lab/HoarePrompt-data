Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, and `path` is an empty list, `curr` is `end`.**

Explanation: The line `curr = end` assigns the value of the variable `end` to the variable `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
