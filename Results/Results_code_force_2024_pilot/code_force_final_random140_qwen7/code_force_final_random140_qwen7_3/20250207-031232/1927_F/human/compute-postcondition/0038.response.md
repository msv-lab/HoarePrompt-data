Output State: **`w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection, `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the disjoint set union (DSU) structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure.**

The code `parent_v = dsu.find(v)` finds the root node of `v` in the DSU structure and assigns it to `parent_v`. The values of `w`, `u`, `v`, and `parent_u` remain unchanged from their initial states.
