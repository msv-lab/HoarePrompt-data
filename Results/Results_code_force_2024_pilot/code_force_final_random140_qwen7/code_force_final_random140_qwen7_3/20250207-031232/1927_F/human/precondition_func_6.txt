test_cases is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 * 10^5), and m represents the number of edges in the graph. Each of the next m lines contains three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices and the graph is not necessarily connected.
