You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `curr` will eventually become `-1` because the loop continues as long as `curr` is not equal to `-1`. During each iteration of the loop, `curr` is set to the immediate predecessor of its current value in the path, and `curr` is appended to the `path` list. This process continues until `curr` reaches `start`, at which point the loop terminates. At this point, `path` contains the full shortest path from `start` to `end`, and `curr` is set to `-1`. The `que` and `prev` variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(path)
    print(*path[::-1])
    #This is printed: the full shortest path from end to start, with nodes separated by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a weighted graph defined by a series of edges and determines if there is a path between two specified vertices for each test case. It first sorts the edges by weight in descending order and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum weight edge that forms a cycle when added to the graph. If such an edge is found, it identifies the nodes involved in the cycle. Then, it performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between the two specified vertices. Finally, it prints the weight of the minimum edge causing a cycle and the length of the shortest path, followed by the shortest path itself in reverse order.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 * 10^5), and m represents the number of edges in the graph. Each of the next m lines contains three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices and the graph is not necessarily connected.

    #State: Output State: `test_cases` must be a positive integer, `_` is equal to `test_cases - 1`, and the function `func_6()` has been called `test_cases` times.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `test_cases` must still be a positive integer (since it started as one and hasn't been modified inside the loop), the loop variable `_` will be equal to `test_cases - 1` (as it increments with each iteration), and the function `func_6()` will have been called exactly `test_cases` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts integers n and m representing the number of vertices and edges in a graph, respectively. It then accepts m lines of input, each containing three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. The function calls another function `func_6()` for each test case, but does not return any value itself. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `test_cases` remains a positive integer and that `func_6()` has been called exactly `test_cases` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. Specifically, the program uses a greedy approach by sorting edges in descending order of weight and checking for cycles using a union-find data structure. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the cycle with the minimal lightest edge weight. 

Consider the following test case:
```
6 6
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 4 1
```
In this case, the program will find a cycle with the minimum edge weight of 1, but it might not be the smallest cycle. For instance, the cycle `1-2-3-1` has a total weight of 3, while the cycle `1-2-3-1` also has a total weight of 3 but includes the edge with weight 1. The program should output the smallest cycle, but it does not ensure this.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated algorithm such as finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) and then finding the cycle with the minimum edge weight in the MST would be required. The current implementation does not handle all potential cases correctly.
