Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It correctly reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, followed by the edges with their weights.

2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`defaultdict(list)`), and edges are stored in a list of tuples `(weight, u, v)`.

3. **Sorting Edges**: The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This allows the algorithm to process the heaviest edges first, which helps in finding cycles with lighter edges.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**: A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to detect cycles. When an edge connects two nodes in the same set, it indicates a cycle. The weight of the lightest edge in such a cycle is recorded.

5. **Finding the Path**: Once a cycle is detected, the program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to trace back the path from the starting node to the ending node. This ensures that the path is a simple cycle.

6. **Output**: The program outputs the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in traversal order.

The program handles all the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement correctly. Therefore, the given program is correct.
