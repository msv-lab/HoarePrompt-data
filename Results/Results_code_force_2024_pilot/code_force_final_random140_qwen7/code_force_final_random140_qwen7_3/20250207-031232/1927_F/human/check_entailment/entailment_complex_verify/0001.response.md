### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads the edges and their weights using a loop and stores them in a list `edges`.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`) and a list of edges (`edges`).

3. **Sorting Edges**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights using `edges.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to keep track of connected components.
   - The DSU operations include `find` and `union`.

5. **Finding Minimum Weight Cycle**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges in reverse order.
   - For each edge `(w, u, v)`, it checks if `u` and `v` belong to the same component using the DSU.
   - If they do, it updates `_min_edge` with the current edge weight `w` and sets `start` and `end` to `u` and `v` respectively.
   - If they don't, it unions `u` and `v`.

6. **Finding the Path**:
   - A BFS is performed starting from `start` to find the path to `end`.
   - The path is stored in a dictionary `prev` to keep track of the previous node in the path.
   - Once the end node is reached, the path is reconstructed by backtracking from `end` to `start`.

7. **Output**:
   - The minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the length of the path `len(path)` are printed.
   - The path is printed in reverse order.

#### Verification

1. **Correctness of DSU Operations**:
   - The DSU operations are correctly implemented and used to detect cycles.
   - The `find` and `union` methods ensure that the DSU maintains the correct connectivity of the graph.

2. **Edge Sorting**:
   - Sorting edges in descending order ensures that the first cycle found will have the smallest minimum edge weight.

3. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - The BFS approach to reconstruct the path is correct and ensures that the path is a simple cycle.
   - The BFS starts from `start` and ends at `end`, ensuring that the path is valid and simple.

4. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over `test_cases` and processing each one separately.

#### Detailed Evaluation

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly initializes the necessary data structures and reads the input as expected.
   - The input reading functions (`func_1`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are used appropriately to read integers and lists of integers.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is constructed correctly using an adjacency list representation.
   - The edges are stored in a list and sorted in descending order of their weights.

3. **Cycle Detection Using DSU**:
   - The DSU operations are used to detect cycles efficiently.
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the minimum weight edge that forms a cycle.

4. **Path Reconstruction Using BFS**:
   - The BFS is used to find the shortest path from `start` to `end`.
   - The path is reconstructed correctly by backtracking from `end` to `start`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight and the length of the path correctly.
   - The path is printed in reverse order, as required.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. The steps are logically sound and handle the problem requirements appropriately.
