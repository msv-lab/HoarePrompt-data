Reasoning: 
The given program appears to correctly implement the solution for finding a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge for each test case. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - `func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`, `func_4()`, and `func_5()` are helper functions to read input from stdin. These functions correctly handle reading integers and lines of input.
   - `func_6()` processes the graph and finds the required cycle. It first reads the number of vertices (`n`) and edges (`m`), initializes a graph and a list of edges, and sorts the edges by weight in descending order.
   - It uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) to detect cycles. When a cycle is detected, it records the minimum weight edge causing the cycle and the vertices involved.
   - A breadth-first search (BFS) is used to find the shortest path between the vertices involved in the cycle. This ensures that the path found is the shortest possible, which is necessary to satisfy the problem constraints.
   - The function then prints the minimum weight of the edge causing the cycle and the length of the shortest path, followed by the path itself in reverse order.

2. **Test Case Handling:**
   - `func_7()` handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, calling `func_6()` for each one. This ensures that the solution is applied to each test case independently.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem statement. It ensures that there is at least one simple cycle in the graph and that the input format is respected.

Given the above analysis, the program logic seems to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
