The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts integers n and m representing the number of vertices and edges in a graph, respectively. It then accepts m lines of input, each containing three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. The function calls another function `func_6()` for each test case, but does not return any value itself. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `test_cases` remains a positive integer and that `func_6()` has been called exactly `test_cases` times.
