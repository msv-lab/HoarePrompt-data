You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `line` is the last line from the input; `p` is the first integer from the last line; `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the last line plus the third integer from the last line; `r` is the third integer from the last line.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which means it reads all lines except the first one.
   - Each line is split into three integers representing the number of introverts (`p`), extroverts (`q`), and universals (`r`).

2. **Combining Extroverts and Universals**:
   - The program combines the number of extroverts and universals by setting `q += r`. This means that each extrovert can be paired with a universal to form a tent with three people.

3. **Calculating Tents Needed**:
   - The expression `(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]` is used to calculate the number of tents needed:
     - `q // 3` calculates how many full tents can be formed with the combined extroverts and universals.
     - `p - q // 3` calculates the remaining number of introverts that need individual tents.
     - The condition `r < q % 3` checks if there are enough universals left to pair with the remaining extroverts. If not, it returns `-1`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Handling Remaining Extroverts**:
   - The logic to handle remaining extroverts is flawed. After forming as many full tents as possible, the remaining extroverts should still be considered. However, the current logic does not account for these remaining extroverts correctly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The condition `r < q % 3` is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the remaining extroverts. For example, if `q % 3 == 2` and `r == 1`, the program incorrectly returns `-1` even though one more universal could be used to form a tent with the remaining extroverts.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that:
1. All introverts get individual tents.
2. As many extroverts as possible are paired with universals to form full tents.
3. Any remaining extroverts are paired with universals or introverts to form as many full tents as possible.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (p, q, r) = map(int, line.split())
        # Calculate full tents from extroverts and universals
        full_tents = q + r // 3
        # Calculate remaining universals after forming full tents
        remaining_universals = r % 3
        # Calculate remaining extroverts after forming full tents
        remaining_extroverts = q % 3
        # Calculate remaining introverts after forming full tents
        remaining_introverts = p - (full_tents - min(full_tents, remaining_universals))
        
        # Calculate additional tents needed for remaining introverts and extroverts
        additional_tents = (remaining_introverts + remaining_extroverts + remaining_universals) // 3
        
        # Total tents needed
        total_tents = full_tents + additional_tents
        
        # If there are remaining introverts and no universals left, return -1
        if remaining_introverts > 0 and remaining_universals == 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(total_tents)
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the remaining extroverts and universals. Therefore, the given program is **Incorrect**.
