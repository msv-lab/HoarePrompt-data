Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `p`, `q`, and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input line.**

Explanation: The code `p, q, r = map(int, line.split())` takes a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The variables `p`, `q`, and `r` are now integers derived from the split and mapped input line.
