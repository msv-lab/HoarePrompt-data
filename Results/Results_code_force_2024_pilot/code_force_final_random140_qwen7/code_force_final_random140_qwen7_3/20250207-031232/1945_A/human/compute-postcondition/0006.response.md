Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `q` is increased by `r`; `p` is now the first integer from the input line; `q` is now the second integer from the input line plus `r`; `r` is now the third integer from the input line.**

Explanation: The code `q += r` increments the value of `q` by the value of `r`. The other variables (`t`, `p`) remain unchanged, and `q` is updated to be the second integer from the input line plus the value of `r`.
