To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression in the `print` statement step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `q` is increased by `r`.
   - `p` is unchanged.
   - `r` is unchanged.

2. **Expression in the `print` Statement:**
   ```python
   print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])
   ```

3. **Breaking Down the Expression:**
   - `(p - q // 3, -1)` is a tuple with two elements: `p - q // 3` and `-1`.
   - `[r < q % 3]` is a boolean expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`.

4. **Evaluating the Boolean Expression:**
   - `r < q % 3`: This checks if `r` is less than the remainder of `q` divided by 3.
   - If `r < q % 3` is `True`, the expression inside the `print` function will evaluate to the first element of the tuple (`p - q // 3`).
   - If `r < q % 3` is `False`, the expression inside the `print` function will evaluate to the second element of the tuple (`-1`).

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `p`, `q`, `r`, and `q % 3` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `p - q // 3`.
   - However, we know that the output will be either `p - q // 3` or `-1`.

Given this analysis, the output will depend on the values of `p`, `q`, and `r`, but it will be one of the two values in the tuple.

Output: **[p - q // 3] if r < q % 3 else -1**
