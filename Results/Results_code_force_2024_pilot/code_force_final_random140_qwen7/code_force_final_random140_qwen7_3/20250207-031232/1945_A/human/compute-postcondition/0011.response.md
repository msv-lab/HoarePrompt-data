Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `line` is the next line from the input, `p` is the first integer from the new line, `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the new line plus the third integer from the new line, `r` is the third integer from the new line.**

Explanation: The code `q += r` increments the value of `q` by the value of `r`. Initially, `q` was the sum of the second and third integers from the new line. After executing the code, `q` now becomes the sum of the second and third integers plus the third integer, which simplifies to the sum of the second and twice the third integer. The values of `t`, `line`, `p`, and `r` remain unchanged.
