Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `q` is increased by `r`, `p` is now the first integer from the input line, `q` is now the second integer from the input line, `r` is now the third integer from the input line.**

Explanation: The code `p, q, r = map(int, line.split())` takes the next line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns them to `p`, `q`, and `r` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `q` is increased by `r` as per the initial state description.
