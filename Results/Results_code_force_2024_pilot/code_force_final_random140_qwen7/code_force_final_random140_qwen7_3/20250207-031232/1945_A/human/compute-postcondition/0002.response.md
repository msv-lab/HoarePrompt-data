Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `q` is increased by `r`, `p` is unchanged, `r` is unchanged.**

The code `q += r` increments the value of `q` by the value of `r`. The values of `t`, `p`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, `q` is updated to its original value plus `r`, and `p` and `r` retain their initial values.
