Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `q` is increased by `r`.
   - `p` is now the first integer from the input line.
   - `q` is now the second integer from the input line plus `r`.
   - `r` is now the third integer from the input line.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   ```python
   print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - We need to determine the value of `q % 3` and compare it with `r`.
   - If `r < q % 3`, then the expression inside the tuple will be selected.
   - Otherwise, `-1` will be selected.

4. **Possible Values**:
   - `q % 3` can be 0, 1, or 2.
   - Depending on the value of `r`, we need to check if `r` is less than `q % 3`.

5. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `q % 3 == 0`, then `r < 0` would make the expression evaluate to `-1`.
   - If `q % 3 == 1`, then `r < 1` would make the expression evaluate to `-1`.
   - If `q % 3 == 2`, then `r < 2` could make the expression evaluate to either `p - q // 3` or `-1`.

6. **Final Expression**:
   - Since `q % 3` can only be 0, 1, or 2, and `r` is an integer, the expression `(p - q // 3, -1)` will be evaluated based on the comparison `r < q % 3`.
   - The exact value depends on the specific values of `p`, `q`, and `r`, but the general form is clear.

Given the general nature of the problem, the output will be one of two values:
- `p - q // 3` if `r < q % 3`.
- `-1` otherwise.

Since we don't have specific values for `p`, `q`, and `r`, we can't determine the exact numerical value, but we can describe the output in terms of the conditions.

Output: **(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]**
