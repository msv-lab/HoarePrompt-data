x is a list of integers representing the results of Jayden's operations on the array a, where each element in x indicates either appending an integer or appending multiple copies of the current array. Additionally, there are q integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_q (1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^{18}, c)), where c is the size of the array after all operations, representing the queries for the k-th element of the final array a.
