Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is an integer representing the size of the final array after all operations.
   - `x` is equal to `((x - 1) % i + 1)`, where `i` is the first element in the list `a`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `x` is not in the list `b`.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, the variable `i` changes to the next element in the list `a`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged until the loop body modifies it.

5. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is still the same as before the loop started.
   - `i` is now the first element in the list `a` (since the loop just started).

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least one element left.
   - `x` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` will be the second element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `x` remains the same.

**Final State**:
- `x` is the same as before the loop started.
- `i` is the second element in the list `a`.

So, the updated state is:
State: **`x` is an integer representing the size of the final array after all operations, and `x` is equal to ((`x` - 1) % i + 1), where `i` is the second element in the list `a`, `a` is a non-empty list, and `x` is not in the list `b`, `a` is a list of integers**
