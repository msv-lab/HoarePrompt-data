Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in a`. This means the variable `i` is being iterated over the elements of the list `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - An element from list `b` is returned at index `x`.
   - `x` is calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1`.
   - `x` is not in the list `b`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `i` from the list `a`, the only variable that changes in each iteration is `i`.
   - Therefore, we need to update the value of `i` for the next iteration.

4. **Calculate the new value of `x` for the next iteration**:
   - The formula for `x` is `(x - 1) % i + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - Let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current` and the next value of `i` as `i_next`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The value of `x` will change based on the new `i` value.
   - We need to ensure that `x` is not in the list `b` for the next iteration.

Given the above steps, let's formulate the new state:

- The current value of `i` is `i_current`.
- The next value of `i` (which will be used in the next iteration) is `i_next`.
- The value of `x` for the next iteration will be calculated as `(x - 1) % i_next + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `i_current` and `x`, we can represent the new state as follows:

State: **`i` is `i_next`, `x` is `(x - 1) % i_next + 1`, and `x` is not in the list `b`**.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is `i_next`, `x` is `(x - 1) % i_next + 1`, and `x` is not in the list `b`**.
