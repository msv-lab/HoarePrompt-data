Output State: **The program returns an element from list 'b' at index 'x', where 'x' is calculated as (x - 1) % i + 1 and 'x' is not in the list 'b'.**

This means the program returns an element from the list `b` at the index specified by the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`, ensuring that `x` is not already present in the list `b`.
