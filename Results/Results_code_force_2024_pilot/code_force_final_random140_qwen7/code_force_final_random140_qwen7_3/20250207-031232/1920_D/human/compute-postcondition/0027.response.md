Postcondition: `i` is `i - 2`, `f` is the same as before, and whether the element at index `2 * (i - 2)` in array `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop. If the condition `a[2 * i] >= x` is true, the loop continues to the next iteration; otherwise, the loop also continues to the next iteration.
