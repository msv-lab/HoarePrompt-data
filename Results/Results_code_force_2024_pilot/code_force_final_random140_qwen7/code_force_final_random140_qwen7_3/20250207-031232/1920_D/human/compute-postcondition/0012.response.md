Output State: **The program returns an element from list 'b' at index 'x', where 'x' is calculated as (`x` - 1) % `i` + 1, and 'x' is not in the list 'b'.**

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer representing the size of the final array after all operations.
- `x` is equal to (`x` - 1) % `i` + 1, where `i` is the second element in the list `a`.
- `x` is not in the list `b`.

The code snippet `return b[x]` will return the element in list `b` at the index specified by `x`. The value of `x` is derived from the formula (`x` - 1) % `i` + 1, ensuring it is within the bounds of list `b` and not already present in `b`.
