### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the analysis step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The array `a` should indeed be initialized as an empty list `[]` rather than `[0]`.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - The check `if a[-1] > 10 ** 19:` is unnecessary and can be removed. The problem guarantees that the size of the array will not exceed \(10^{19}\).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It uses modulo arithmetic incorrectly and does not correctly handle the structure of the array formed by repeated appending. Specifically, it does not correctly map the queried index back to the original array structure.

Given these points, the original assessment correctly identified the issues and proposed a corrected version of the program. The corrected program initializes `a` as an empty list and processes the operations correctly without the unnecessary check. The final part of the corrected program directly maps the queried indices to the original array structure, ensuring the correct result.

### Final Evaluation:

Since the original assessment correctly identified the issues and provided a corrected version of the program, the final evaluation is:

**Final: True**

The given program, when corrected, is now correct according to the problem description.
