Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves simulating a series of operations on an initially empty array `a`. Operations can either append an integer `x` to the end of `a` or append `x` copies of the current array `a` to itself. The goal is to answer `q` queries about the `k-th` element in the final array `a`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it initializes an array `a` with a dummy element `[0]` and a dictionary `b` to store the size of the array at certain points.
   - It then processes each operation, updating `a` and `b` accordingly.
   - After processing all operations, the code reverses `a` and prints the result of applying a function `r` to the input queries.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` and aims to find the `k-th` element in the final array `a`.
   - If `x` is directly in `b`, it returns the corresponding value.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the reversed array `a`, updating `x` using `(x - 1) % i + 1` until `x` matches an index in `b`.
   - This approach effectively maps the position `x` back to the original array structure formed by the operations.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the mapping of positions in the final array back to the original operations.
   - The use of modulo arithmetic ensures that the position wraps around correctly when the array is extended.
   - The reversal of `a` and the specific update rule in `func_1` ensure that the function accurately finds the `k-th` element in the final array.

Based on the above analysis, the provided code and function `func_1` correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
