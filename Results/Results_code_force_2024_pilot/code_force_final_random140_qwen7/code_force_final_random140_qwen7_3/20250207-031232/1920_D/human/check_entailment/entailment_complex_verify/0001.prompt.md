You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers representing the results of Jayden's operations on the array a, where each element in x indicates either appending an integer or appending multiple copies of the current array. Additionally, there are q integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_q (1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^{18}, c)), where c is the size of the array after all operations, representing the queries for the k-th element of the final array a.
def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the element at index x in list b, where x is an integer representing the size of the final array after all operations and is present in the list b.
    #State: `x` is an integer representing the size of the final array after all operations, and `x` is not in the list `b`
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: Output State: The function has either returned an element from list `b` at index `x` or returned None if `x` is never found in list `b`.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the loop's behavior, it will continue to update `x` based on the formula `x = (x - 1) % i + 1` for each iteration, where `i` is an element from the list `a`. If at any point `x` matches an index in list `b`, the function returns the corresponding value from `b`. Since the loop continues until `x` matches an index in `b` or all iterations are completed, the final output will be either a value from `b` or `None` if no such match is found during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `x`, which is an integer. It then checks if `x` is present in list `b`. If `x` is found in `b`, it returns the element at index `x` from `b`. If `x` is not found in `b`, it iterates through the list `a`, updating `x` using the formula `x = (x - 1) % i + 1` for each element `i` in `a`. If during this process, `x` becomes an index present in `b`, it returns the corresponding element from `b`. If no such index is found, it returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` is initialized as `[0]`, but it should be initialized as an empty list `[]` since we need to append elements to it.
   - `b` is initialized as an empty dictionary `{}`.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d` are read.
   - For each operation, either an integer `x` is appended to the end of `a` or `x` copies of `a` are appended to `a`.

3. **Processing Operations**:
   - The code checks if `a[-1]` exceeds \(10^{19}\). If it does, it skips the current operation, which is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the size of the array will not exceed \(10^{19}\).
   - If the operation is of type 1 (`d & 1 == 1`), it increments the last element of `a` and updates the dictionary `b` with the new value and index.
   - If the operation is of type 2 (`d & 1 == 0`), it appends the length of the current array multiplied by `e + 1` to `a`.

4. **Reversing and Query Processing**:
   - The array `a` is reversed.
   - Queries are processed using a function `func_1` which computes the position of the queried index in the original array.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function attempts to find the original index of the queried position by iterating through the array `a` and adjusting the position accordingly.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It uses modulo arithmetic incorrectly and does not correctly handle the structure of the array formed by repeated appending.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Initialization**: `a` should be initialized as `[]`.
2. **Unnecessary Check**: The check `if a[-1] > 10 ** 19:` is unnecessary and can be removed.
3. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The logic for finding the original index is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the structure of the array.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = []
    b = {}
    (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    for i in range(c):
        (d, e) = map(int, input().split())
        if d & 1:
            a.append(e)
            b[len(a)] = e
        else:
            a.extend([a[-1]] * e)
    print(' '.join(map(str, [b[(k - 1) // len(a) + 1] if (k - 1) // len(a) + 1 in b else (k - 1) % len(a) + 1 for k in map(int, input().split())])))
```

### Conclusion:
The given program has logical errors and does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
