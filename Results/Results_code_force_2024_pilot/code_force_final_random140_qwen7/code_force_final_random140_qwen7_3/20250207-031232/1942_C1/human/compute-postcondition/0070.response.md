Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, x + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`.
   - `x` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is the current value of `x`.
   - `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute again if `x` is greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - `x` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration because the loop body does not change `x`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `ans` remains the same.
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` is now 3.
   - The difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is still equal to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the current value of `x`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2**.
