Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 0, `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is 1.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially not specified in the initial state, we assume it was 0 before this line of code was executed. After executing this line, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
