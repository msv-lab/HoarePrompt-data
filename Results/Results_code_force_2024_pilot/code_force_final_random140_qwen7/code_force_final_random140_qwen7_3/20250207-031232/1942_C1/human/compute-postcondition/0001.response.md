Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the value entered by the user, ensuring it is within the specified range. The other conditions and variables related to `n`, `x`, `y`, and the vertices remain as they were in the initial state.
