Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `i` is the final value of `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` will hold the total count of consecutive pairs in the array `arr` that differ by exactly 2, `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `[n, x, y]`. The values of `i`, `x`, `ans`, and `t` are updated as follows:
- `i` is set to the value of `x`.
- `x` is set to the second value from the input.
- `y` is set to the third value from the input.
- `t` is decreased by 1, and it remains greater than 0.
