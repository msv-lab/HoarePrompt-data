Output State: **`i` will be the final value of `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, and `ans` will hold the total count of consecutive pairs in the array `arr` that differ by exactly 2, `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0.**

The value of `t` is decreased by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
