Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was met for `i` from 1 to `x`, `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers converted from the input with `n + arr[0]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `n + arr[0]` to the list `arr`. The values of `i`, `ans`, `t`, and the initial state of `arr` (which is a sorted list of integers converted from the input) remain unchanged except for the new element added to the list.
