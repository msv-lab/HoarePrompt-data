Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is the second integer entered by the user, and `ans` is 1.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 0 (implied from the initial state), it becomes 1 after this operation. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The condition about the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` being equal to 2 is also still valid.
