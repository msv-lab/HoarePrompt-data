Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is already within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

**Conclusion**: No changes are needed to the state of `t` or any other variables.

**Answer**:
State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
