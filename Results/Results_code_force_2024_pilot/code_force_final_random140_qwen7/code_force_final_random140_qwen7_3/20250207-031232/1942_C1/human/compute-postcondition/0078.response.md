Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be the final value of `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, and `ans` will hold the total count of consecutive pairs in the array `arr` that differ by exactly 2. The variable `t` will be 0 since all iterations of the loop have been completed, and `arr` will be a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`.

In simpler terms, `i` will be the final value of `x`, `x` must still be greater than 0, and `ans` will hold the total count of consecutive pairs in the array `arr` that differ by exactly 2. The loop variable `t` will be 0, indicating that no more iterations are left to execute.
