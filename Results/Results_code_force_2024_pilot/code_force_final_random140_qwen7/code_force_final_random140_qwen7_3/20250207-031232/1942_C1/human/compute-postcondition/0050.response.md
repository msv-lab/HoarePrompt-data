Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x`.
- `x` must be greater than 0.
- `ans` will be incremented by 1 each time the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is met for all `i` from 1 to `x`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which represents the total count of consecutive pairs in the array `arr` that differ by exactly 2.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total count of consecutive pairs in the array arr that differ by exactly 2)**
