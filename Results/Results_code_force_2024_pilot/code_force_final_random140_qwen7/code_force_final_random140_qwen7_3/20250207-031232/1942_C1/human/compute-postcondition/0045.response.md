Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 0, and `ans` is 2**.

Explanation: The initial value of `ans` is 1 if `arr[2] - arr[1]` equals 2, otherwise, it remains unchanged. After executing `ans += 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1, making its value 2. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
