Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be the final value of `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, and `ans` will hold the total count of consecutive pairs in the array `arr` that differ by exactly 2. The variable `t` will be 0 since all iterations of the loop have been completed, and `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `ans` will reflect the final state after processing all inputs.

In simpler terms, `i` will be the final value of `x`, `x` must still be greater than 0, and `ans` will hold the total count of consecutive pairs in the array `arr` that differ by exactly 2. The loop variable `t` will be 0 as it has been decremented to 0 after all iterations.
