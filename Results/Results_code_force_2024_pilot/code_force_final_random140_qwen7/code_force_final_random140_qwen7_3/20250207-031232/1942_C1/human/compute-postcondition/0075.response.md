Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the current value of `x + 2`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is the final value of `x`, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2 or the loop has executed without finding such a pair.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will have the value of `x + 2`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = x`, and each time it finds that the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. Since the loop executes `x` times, `ans` starts from `x - 2` (initial state) and ends up as `x + 2` after all iterations. All other variables (`arr`, `t`, and `i`) retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
