Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` starts from 1.
   - `x` is greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`.
   - `x` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is the current value of `x`.
   - `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2.

5. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `i` (which is 2) is less than or equal to `x`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making it `i = 3`.
   - The condition `x` is greater than 0 remains unchanged.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `x` remains greater than 0.

7. **Other states remain unchanged**:
   - `arr` remains a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`.
   - `ans` remains the current value of `x`.
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - The difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` will be checked again in the next iteration, but since no changes are mentioned, it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the current value of `x`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2.**
