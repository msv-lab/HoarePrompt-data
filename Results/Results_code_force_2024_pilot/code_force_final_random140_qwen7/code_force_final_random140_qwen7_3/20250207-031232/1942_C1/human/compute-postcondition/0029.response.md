Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was met for `i` from 1 to `x`, and `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is a list of strings converted from the input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This affects the `arr` variable, converting it from a non-existent state to a list of strings. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `t`, `x`, `y`, and the list `[n, x, y]`) remain unchanged in terms of their types and relationships but may have their values altered if they were used in the subsequent operations which are not provided in the given code snippet.
