Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers converted from the original list of strings, `i` is the final value of `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code converts each element in the list `arr` from string to integer using a list comprehension. The length of the new list `arr` will be equal to `x`. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
