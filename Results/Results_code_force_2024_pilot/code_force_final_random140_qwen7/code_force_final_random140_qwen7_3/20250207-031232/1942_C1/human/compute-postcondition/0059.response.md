Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, x + 1)`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will start with `i = 1` and increment `i` until `i` reaches `x + 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be within the range specified by `range(1, x + 1)`.
   - Since `i` is defined as the final value of `x` and `x` must be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `i` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `x + 1`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We know that `x` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is the final value of `x`, `i` must be at least 1 (because `x` is greater than 0).
   - The value of `i` should be set to 1 at the start of the loop, but since `i` is already defined as the final value of `x`, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 1.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `x` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

Since `i` is defined as the final value of `x`, and `x` must be greater than 0, we can summarize the necessary adjustments.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` is `x - 2`, `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0, `i` is 1**
