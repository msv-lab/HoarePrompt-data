Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    arr.sort()
    arr.append(n + arr[0])
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `x`, `x` is the second integer entered by the user, and `ans` is the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was met for `i` from 1 to `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, and `ans` will be incremented by 1 each time the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is met for all `i` from 1 to `x`.

In simpler terms, `i` will be the final value of `x`, `x` must still be greater than 0, and `ans` will hold the total count of consecutive pairs in the array `arr` that differ by exactly 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the current value of `x + 2`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is the final value of `x`, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2 or the loop has executed without finding such a pair.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
