Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was met for `i` from 1 to `x`, `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the input.**

Explanation: The code converts each element in the list `arr` from strings to integers using a list comprehension. The values of `i`, `ans`, `t`, and the list `arr` are updated as follows:
- `i` remains unchanged and is still `x`.
- `ans` remains unchanged as the condition checking is not performed yet.
- `t` is decremented by 1.
- Each element in `arr` is now an integer, derived from converting the original string elements.
