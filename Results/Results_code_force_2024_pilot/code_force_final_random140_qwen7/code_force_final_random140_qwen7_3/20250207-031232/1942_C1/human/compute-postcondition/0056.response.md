Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is the final value of `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `ans`, `t`) are not affected by this sorting operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
