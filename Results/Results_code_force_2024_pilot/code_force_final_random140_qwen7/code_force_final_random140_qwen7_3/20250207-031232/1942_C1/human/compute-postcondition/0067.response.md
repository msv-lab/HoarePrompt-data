Postcondition: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the current value of `x`, `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0, `i` is 2, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2. If the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is true, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
