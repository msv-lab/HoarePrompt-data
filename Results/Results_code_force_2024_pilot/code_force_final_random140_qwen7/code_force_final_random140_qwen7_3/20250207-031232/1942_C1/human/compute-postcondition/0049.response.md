Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, and `ans` will be incremented by 1 each time the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is met for all `i` from 1 to `x`.

In simpler terms, `i` will be the final value of `x`, `x` must still be greater than 0, and `ans` will hold the total count of consecutive pairs in the array `arr` that differ by exactly 2.
