Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `x`, and `range(1, x + 1)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` because the range function in Python starts from the first argument (which is 1 in this case) and goes up to but does not include the second argument (`x + 1`).

3. **Determine the Value of `x`**: The value of `x` is determined by the second integer entered by the user. Since the loop will run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`, `x` must be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be set to `1` at the start of the loop.
   - `x` should be the second integer entered by the user.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `y`, `arr`, and `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `1`.
- `x` should be the second integer entered by the user.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is the second integer entered by the user**
