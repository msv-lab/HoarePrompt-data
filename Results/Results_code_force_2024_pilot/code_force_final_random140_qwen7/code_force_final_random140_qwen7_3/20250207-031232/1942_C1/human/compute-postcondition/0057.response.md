Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`, `i` is the final value of `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `n + arr[0]` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially a sorted list of integers, appending `n + arr[0]` maintains the sorted order because `n + arr[0]` is added to the end of the list. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
