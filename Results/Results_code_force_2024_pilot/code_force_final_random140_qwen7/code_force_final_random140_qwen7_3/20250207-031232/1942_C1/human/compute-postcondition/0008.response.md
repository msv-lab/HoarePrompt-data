Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer entered by the user; `x` is the second integer entered by the user; `y` is the third integer entered by the user; `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `n + arr[0]` to the list `arr`. Here, `arr[0]` is the first element of the sorted list `arr`, which was originally a list of integers converted from the first `x` elements of a list of strings. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as does `t`, `x`, and `y`. The updated list `arr` now includes the new element `n + arr[0]`.
