Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer entered by the user; `x` is the second integer entered by the user; `y` is the third integer entered by the user; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the original list of strings.**

Explanation: The code replaces each element in the list `arr` with its integer representation, up to the index `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` is now a list of integers, specifically the first `x` elements of the original list of strings converted to integers.
