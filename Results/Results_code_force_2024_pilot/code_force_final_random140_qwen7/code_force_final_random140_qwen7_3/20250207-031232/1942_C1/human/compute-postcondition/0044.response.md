Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is being incremented within the loop.
   - `x`: This variable is used as the upper limit for the range function.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` is either 1 (if `arr[2] - arr[1]` equals 2) or remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next Values for `i` and `x`:**
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value for `i` will be `i + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must still be greater than 0. However, the value of `x` itself does not change within the loop body based on the given information.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `x` must still be greater than 0.
   - The value of `ans` remains unchanged unless the condition `arr[2] - arr[1] == 2` is met, but since this condition is evaluated within the loop body, it does not affect the state adjustment here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 0, and `ans` is 1 if `arr[2] - arr[1]` equals 2; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
