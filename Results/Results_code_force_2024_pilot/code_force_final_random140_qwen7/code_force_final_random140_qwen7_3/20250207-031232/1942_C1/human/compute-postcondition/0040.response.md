Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1` and `x` must be greater than `0`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `2` in the next iteration.
   - Since `x` must remain the same for the loop condition to hold true, `x` will still be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The variable `i` will be `2`.
   - The variable `x` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The postcondition regarding `ans` (whether `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` equals `2`) will be checked again in the next iteration, but its value does not change based on the loop alone.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 0**
