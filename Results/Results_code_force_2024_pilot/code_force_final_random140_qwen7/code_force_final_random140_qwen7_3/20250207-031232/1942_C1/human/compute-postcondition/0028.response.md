Output State: **`i` is `x`, `x` is the second integer entered by the user, `ans` is the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was met for `i` from 1 to `x`, and `t` is `t - 1`, `[n, x, y]` is a list containing three integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` is still `x`, `x` is the second integer entered by the user, `ans` is the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was met for `i` from 1 to `x`, and `t` is `t - 1`. Additionally, the list `[n, x, y]` is created and contains the three integers entered by the user.
