Output State: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`. The variable `x` is greater than 0 and represents the final value of the loop counter `i`. The variable `ans` is the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was true during the loop's execution. The variable `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by the number of loop iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to `x`, which is the total number of iterations the loop ran.
