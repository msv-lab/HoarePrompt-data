Postcondition: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the current value of `x` plus 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2. This is because if the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is true, `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.
