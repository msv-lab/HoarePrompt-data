Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given that `ans` was initially not specified in the initial state, we assume it to be 0 (as it is a common default value for such operations). After the increment, `ans` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
