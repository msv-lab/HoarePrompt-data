The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \). For each test case, it reads \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \), sorts them, appends \( n + \) first element to the end of the list, and counts the number of consecutive pairs in the list that differ by exactly 2. It then prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final count for each one.
