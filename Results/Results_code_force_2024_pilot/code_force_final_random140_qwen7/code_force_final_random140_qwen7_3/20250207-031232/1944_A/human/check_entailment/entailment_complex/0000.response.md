Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges.
- The annotated program correctly implements the logic for the function `func_1`. 
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function returns 1, meaning Everule can only visit island 1 because all other bridges can be destroyed.
- If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function returns `n`, meaning all islands are still reachable because fewer than `n - 1` bridges can be destroyed, which is not enough to isolate island 1 from the others.

Given the logic in the function and the constraints provided, the function `func_1` correctly computes the required result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
