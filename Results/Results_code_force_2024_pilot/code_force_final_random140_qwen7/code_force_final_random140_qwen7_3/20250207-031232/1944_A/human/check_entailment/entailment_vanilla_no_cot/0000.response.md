Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the optimal strategy that Dominater might use to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit. Here's why:

1. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - For small values of `k`, the function should consider the possibility of disconnecting more than just one island from Everule's starting point (island 1).
   - The current implementation assumes that if `k < n - 1`, Everule can still visit all `n` islands, which is not always true.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If `k >= n - 1`, destroying `n - 1` bridges would isolate Everule from all other islands except his own.
   - If `k < n - 1`, the optimal strategy involves disconnecting the smallest number of islands from Everule such that he cannot reach them directly or indirectly through the remaining bridges.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n - 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # Calculate the minimum number of islands Everule can visit
        # If k < n-1, we need to find the minimum number of islands that can be isolated
        # This can be done by considering the worst-case scenario where Dominater destroys bridges optimally
        return max(1, n - k)
```

This updated function ensures that the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is correctly calculated based on the value of `k`.
