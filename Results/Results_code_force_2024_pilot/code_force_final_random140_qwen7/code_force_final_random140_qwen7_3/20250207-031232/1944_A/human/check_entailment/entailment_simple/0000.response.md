Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges. Initially, there are `n` islands fully connected by bridges, and Everule starts from island 1.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)` Analysis**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it means that Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate Everule from all other islands except possibly island 1. In this case, the function correctly returns 1.
   - Otherwise, if `k < n-1`, it means that Everule can still reach more than one island because destroying fewer than `n-1` bridges cannot completely isolate any island from the others. Therefore, the function correctly returns `n`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k = 0`, no bridges are destroyed, so Everule can visit all `n` islands.
   - When `k = n-1`, exactly one bridge is destroyed for each possible connection minus one, which isolates all islands except possibly island 1.
   - When `k > n-1`, it's not possible to isolate more than one island, so Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

4. **Given Examples**:
   - For `n=2` and `k=0`, the function returns 2 (all islands reachable).
   - For `n=2` and `k=1`, the function returns 1 (island 2 is isolated).
   - For `n=4` and `k=1`, the function returns 4 (since `k < n-1`, all islands are reachable).
   - For `n=5` and `k=10`, the function returns 1 (all bridges are destroyed, isolating island 1).
   - For `n=5` and `k=3`, the function returns 5 (since `k < n-1`, all islands are reachable).
   - For `n=4` and `k=4`, the function returns 1 (all bridges are destroyed, isolating island 1).

Based on the analysis and the examples provided, the function `func_1(n, k)` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
