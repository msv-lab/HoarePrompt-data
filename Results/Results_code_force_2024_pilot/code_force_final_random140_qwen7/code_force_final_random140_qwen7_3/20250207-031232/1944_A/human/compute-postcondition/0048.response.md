Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a new value of `reachable_count` based on the initial values of \( n \) and \( k \). The calculation involves reducing `k` until it reaches zero by decrementing `reachable_count` accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
