Output State: **`k` is `k - n`, `reachable_count` is `n - 1`**

Explanation: Initially, `k` is set to `k - n`, and `reachable_count` is set to `n`. After executing `reachable_count -= 1`, `reachable_count` is decremented by 1, making it `n - 1`. The value of `k` remains unchanged from its initial state since no further operations affect it.
