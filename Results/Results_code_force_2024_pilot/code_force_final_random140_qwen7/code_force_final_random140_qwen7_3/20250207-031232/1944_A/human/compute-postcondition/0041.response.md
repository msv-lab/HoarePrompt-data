Output State: **`k` is greater than or equal to `2`, `reachable_count` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: Initially, `k` must be greater than or equal to `reachable_count + 1`. After executing `k -= reachable_count - 1`, `k` is reduced by `reachable_count - 1`. Since `k` was initially at least `reachable_count + 1`, subtracting `reachable_count - 1` from it ensures that `k` is now at least `2` (because `reachable_count + 1 - (reachable_count - 1) = 2`). The value of `reachable_count` remains unchanged.
