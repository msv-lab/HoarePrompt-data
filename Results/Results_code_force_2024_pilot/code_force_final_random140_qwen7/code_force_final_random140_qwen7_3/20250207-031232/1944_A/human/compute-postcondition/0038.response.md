Output State: **`k` is 0, `reachable_count` is `n - 1`**

Explanation: Initially, `k` is at least `n - 1` and greater than 0, and `reachable_count` is `n - 1`. The code `k -= reachable_count - 1` subtracts `reachable_count - 1` from `k`. Since `reachable_count` is `n - 1`, `reachable_count - 1` is `n - 2`. Therefore, `k` becomes `k - (n - 2)`. Given that `k` is at least `n - 1`, the smallest possible value for `k` before the operation is `n - 1`. Subtracting `n - 2` from `n - 1` results in `0`. Thus, `k` becomes `0`, and `reachable_count` remains `n - 1`.
