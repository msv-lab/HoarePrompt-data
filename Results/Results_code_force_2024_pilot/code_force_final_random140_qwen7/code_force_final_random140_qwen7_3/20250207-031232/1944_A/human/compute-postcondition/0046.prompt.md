Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `qs` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(qs):
    n, k = [int(num) for num in input().split()]
    reachable_count = n
    while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
        k -= reachable_count - 1
        reachable_count -= 1
    print(reachable_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `qs` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - (reachable_count - 1)` for each iteration until `k < reachable_count - 1` or `k` becomes 0, `n` is the first integer input, `reachable_count` is decreased by 1 for each iteration until `reachable_count` becomes 0.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `k` will be reduced by `(reachable_count - 1)` for each pass through the loop, and `reachable_count` will decrease by 1 with each iteration until either `k` is less than `reachable_count - 1` or `reachable_count` reaches 0. The variables `t` and `qs` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `n` is updated to the first integer input, `k` is 0, `qs` is still greater than 0, `reachable_count` is -3.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, `reachable_count` decreases by 1 and `k` is decreased by `reachable_count - 1`. The loop continues as long as `k >= reachable_count - 1` and `k > 0`. Given that `reachable_count` starts at 0 and decreases by 1 with each iteration, and `k` starts at some positive value and is reduced accordingly, after 3 iterations, `reachable_count` becomes -3. For the fourth iteration, `reachable_count - 1` would be -4, making `k >= reachable_count - 1` false since `k` cannot be greater than or equal to -4 if it has been reduced sufficiently. Therefore, the loop terminates after 3 iterations, leaving `k` at 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `k` is 0; `reachable_count` is 0.

Explanation: After the first iteration, `k` becomes `k - n` and `reachable_count` becomes `n - 1`. After the second iteration, both `k` and `reachable_count` become 0. For the third iteration, since `k` is already 0, the condition `k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0` fails, so the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `k` remains 0 and `reachable_count` also remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
