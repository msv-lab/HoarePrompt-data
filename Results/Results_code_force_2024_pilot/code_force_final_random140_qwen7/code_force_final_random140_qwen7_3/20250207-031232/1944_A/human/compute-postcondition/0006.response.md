Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `qs` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - (reachable_count - 1)`, `n` is the first integer input, `reachable_count` is `reachable_count - 1`**.

Explanation: The line `reachable_count -= 1` decrements the value of `reachable_count` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
