Output State: `k` is 0; `reachable_count` is 0.

Explanation: After the first iteration, `k` becomes 0 and `reachable_count` becomes `n-1`. Since the condition `k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0` is no longer satisfied (as `k` is 0), the loop stops executing. Therefore, after all iterations, both `k` and `reachable_count` will be 0.
