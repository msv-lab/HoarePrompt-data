Output State: `k` is 0; `reachable_count` is 0.

Explanation: After the first iteration, `k` becomes `k - n` and `reachable_count` becomes `n - 1`. After the second iteration, both `k` and `reachable_count` become 0. For the third iteration, since `k` is already 0, the condition `k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0` fails, so the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `k` remains 0 and `reachable_count` also remains 0.
