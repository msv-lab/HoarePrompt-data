Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `a`.
- `p` is a list containing all odd numbers from 1 up to `a-1`.
- `a` must be greater than 3.

Let's break down the steps:

1. Since `i` is equal to `a`, and `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2 each time, the loop will add all odd numbers from 1 up to `a-1` to the list `p`.

2. The list `p` will contain all odd numbers from 1 up to `a-1`. For example, if `a` is 5, then `p` would be `[1, 3]`. If `a` is 7, then `p` would be `[1, 3, 5]`.

3. The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be the list of all odd numbers from 1 up to `a-1`.

Output: **[all odd numbers from 1 up to a-1]**
