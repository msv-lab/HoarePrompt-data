Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `a` must be at least 7, `i` will be equal to the largest even number less than or equal to `a`, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including the largest even number less than or equal to `a`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `p` will contain every even number starting from 2 up to the largest even number that does not exceed `a`. The value of `i` will be the last even number added to the list `p` during the final iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, a + 1, 2):
    p += [i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` must be at least 7, `i` is the largest odd number less than or equal to `a`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` must be at least 7, `i` becomes the next smaller odd number if it exists, or the same value if there is no smaller odd number, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i` after the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` must be at least 7, `i` becomes the next smaller odd number if it exists, or the same value if there is no smaller odd number, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i` after the next iteration, which is `[i]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
