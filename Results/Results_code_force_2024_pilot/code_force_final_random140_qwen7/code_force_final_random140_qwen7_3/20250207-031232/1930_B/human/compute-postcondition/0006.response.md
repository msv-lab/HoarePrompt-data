Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `a` must be at least 2, `i` is 4, `p` is a list containing the integers 2 and 4.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `p`. Initially, `p` contains the integer 2. After executing the code, `p` will contain both 2 and 4. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
