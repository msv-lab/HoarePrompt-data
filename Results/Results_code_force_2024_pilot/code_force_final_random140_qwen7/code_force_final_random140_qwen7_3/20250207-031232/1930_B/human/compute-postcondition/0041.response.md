Output State: **`p` is a list containing the last value of `i` added to it.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. Since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we only know that the last value of `i` is added to the list `p`. All other variables remain unchanged.
