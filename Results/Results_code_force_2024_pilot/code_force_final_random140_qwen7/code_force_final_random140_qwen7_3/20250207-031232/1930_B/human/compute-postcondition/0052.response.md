Output State: **`i` is 3; `a` must be greater than 3; `p` is a list containing 3**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `p`. Since `i` is 3, `p` becomes a list containing the element 3. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it must still be greater than 3.
