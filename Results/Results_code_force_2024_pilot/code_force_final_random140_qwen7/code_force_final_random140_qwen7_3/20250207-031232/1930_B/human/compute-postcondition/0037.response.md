Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The list `p` contains all even numbers less than `a`.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `i` is `a + 2 * (number of iterations)`.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `i in range(int(input()))`.

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will iterate based on the user input, which is an integer value.
   - Let's denote this user input as `user_input`.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `p` contains all even numbers less than `a`.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `i` is `a + 2 * (number of iterations)`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop condition is based on `user_input`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is `a + 2 * (number of iterations)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range specified by `user_input`.

6. **New State**:
   - `p` still contains all even numbers less than `a`.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `i` is updated to `a + 2 * (number of iterations + 1)`, which is `a + 2 * (previous number of iterations + 1)`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`p` contains all even numbers less than `a`, `a` remains the same, and `i` is `a + 2 * (number of iterations + 1)`**.
