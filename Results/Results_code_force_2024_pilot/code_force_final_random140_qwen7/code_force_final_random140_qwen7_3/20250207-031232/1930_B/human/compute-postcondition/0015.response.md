Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `a` must be at least 7.
   - `i` becomes the next smaller odd number if it exists, or the same value if there is no smaller odd number.
   - `p` is a list containing the new value of `i` after the next iteration.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in steps of 2 starting from 1 up to `a` (inclusive).

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be an odd number and less than `a`.

4. **Determine the New Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is the next smaller odd number if it exists, we need to check if the current `i` is the smallest odd number (which would be 1) or if there is a smaller odd number before it.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `a` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` will be the next smaller odd number if it exists. If `i` was 1 initially or if there is no smaller odd number, `i` will remain the same.
   - `p` will contain the new value of `i` after the next iteration.

6. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `i` was 1 initially, then `i` will remain 1.
   - If `i` was an odd number greater than 1, it will become the next smaller odd number.

Given these points, let's determine the new state:

- If `i` was 1 initially, it will remain 1.
- If `i` was an odd number greater than 1, it will become the next smaller odd number.

Since we don't know the exact initial value of `i`, we consider both scenarios. However, the key point is that `i` will be the next smaller odd number if it exists, or the same value if there is no smaller odd number.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` must be at least 7, `i` becomes the next smaller odd number if it exists, or the same value if there is no smaller odd number, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i` after the next iteration.**
