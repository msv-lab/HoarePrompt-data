Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over even numbers starting from 2 up to `a` (inclusive) with a step of 2.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p` is a list containing the last value of `i` added to it plus the current value of `i`.
   - `i` is `last_i + 2`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` will be `last_i + 4`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `a`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `last_i + 4`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `last_i + 4` must be less than or equal to `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`p` is a list containing the last value of `i` added to it plus the current value of `i`, and `i` is last_i + 4, and a must be greater than or equal to last_i + 4**.
