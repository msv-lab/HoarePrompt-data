Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - The list `p` contains all even numbers less than `a`.
   - `a` remains the same (its value is not specified but it is a constant).
   - `i` is defined as `a + 2 * (number of iterations)`. Since the number of iterations is not specified, let's consider the context of the problem. Typically, in such problems, the number of iterations would be related to the length of the list `p`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement `print(*p)` will print all elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Given that `p` contains all even numbers less than `a`, the exact elements of `p` depend on the value of `a`. For example, if `a` is 10, then `p` would be `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not specified, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `p`.

Output: **all even numbers less than [a]**
