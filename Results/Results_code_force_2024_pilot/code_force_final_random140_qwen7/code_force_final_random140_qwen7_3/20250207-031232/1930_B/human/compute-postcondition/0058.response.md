Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function determines whether the conditions for `t` and `n` are met and returns appropriate results based on these conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing values for `t` and `n`, and validate these values according to specified constraints.
