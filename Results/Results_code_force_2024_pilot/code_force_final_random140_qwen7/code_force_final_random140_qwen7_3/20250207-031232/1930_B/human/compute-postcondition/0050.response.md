Output State: **`i` is 3; `p` is a list containing the values 1 and 3; `a` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `p`. Initially, `p` contains the value 1. After executing the code, `p` will contain both 1 and 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and the condition for `a` (it must be greater than or equal to 3) is still valid.
