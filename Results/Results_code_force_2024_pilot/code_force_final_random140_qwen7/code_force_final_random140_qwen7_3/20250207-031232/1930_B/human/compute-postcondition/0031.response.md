Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `p` is a list containing all even numbers less than `a`.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `i` is `a`.
   - `p` is appended with the value of `i`.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, a + 1, 2)`, meaning it increments `i` by 2 starting from 1 up to but not including `a`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `p` contains all even numbers less than `a`.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now equal to `a` (since the loop just appended `i` to `p`).
   - `p` has been updated to include the latest value of `i`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2 within the range `1` to `a`.
   - Since `i` is currently `a`, the next value of `i` would be `a + 2`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be set to `a + 2`.
   - `p` should still contain all even numbers less than `a` because appending `i` to `p` does not change the list itself; it only appends the value of `i` if `i` is even.
   - `a` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` is `a + 2`.
- `p` remains the list of all even numbers less than `a`.
- `a` remains the same.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`p` is a list containing all even numbers less than `a`, `a` remains the same, `i` is `a + 2`**.
