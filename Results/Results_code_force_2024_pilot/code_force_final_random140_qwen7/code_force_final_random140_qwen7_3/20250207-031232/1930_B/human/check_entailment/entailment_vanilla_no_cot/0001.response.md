Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes a list `a` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then iterates through half of the list (up to `n // 2`), swapping elements at even and odd indices to create a specific pattern:
     - `a[2 * i + 1] = n - i`
     - `a[2 * i] = i + 1`
   - This means:
     - Even-indexed positions (starting from 0) are filled with values from 1 to `n // 2`.
     - Odd-indexed positions are filled with values from `n` down to `n - (n // 2)`.

3. **Handling Odd-Length Permutations**:
   - If `n` is odd, the last element is set to `n // 2 + 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The constructed list `a` is printed.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Permutation Validity**:
  - The constructed permutation should not have pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and both `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
  - Let's verify this by considering the constructed permutation pattern:
    - For even `n`, the pattern alternates between small and large values.
    - For odd `n`, the middle value is adjusted to ensure the pattern holds.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1: `n = 4`**
  - Constructed permutation: `[1, 4, 2, 3]`
  - Check pairs:
    - `(1, 4)`: 1 does not divide 4.
    - `(1, 2)`: 1 does not divide 2.
    - `(1, 3)`: 1 does not divide 3.
    - `(2, 4)`: 2 does not divide 4.
    - `(2, 3)`: 2 does not divide 3.
    - `(3, 4)`: 3 does not divide 4.
  - All pairs satisfy the condition.

- **Test Case 2: `n = 3`**
  - Constructed permutation: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Check pairs:
    - `(1, 2)`: 1 does not divide 2.
    - `(1, 3)`: 1 does not divide 3.
    - `(2, 3)`: 2 does not divide 3.
  - All pairs satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:

The given program constructs a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
