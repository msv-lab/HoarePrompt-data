Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not satisfy the problem requirements. The logic in the function `func()` generates an alternating sequence of even and odd numbers, which does not guarantee that no two pairs \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) will have the property that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

For example, consider the generated permutation for \( n = 4 \):
\[ [2, 1, 4, 3] \]

Here, \( p_1 = 2 \) divides \( p_3 = 4 \), and \( p_2 = 1 \) divides \( p_4 = 3 \). This violates the condition that no such pairs should exist.

A correct approach would involve generating a permutation where no such pairs exist. One possible correct solution could be to interleave the largest and smallest remaining numbers, ensuring that no division conditions are met. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(range(1, n + 1))
        # Interleave the largest and smallest remaining numbers
        for i in range(n // 2):
            p[2 * i], p[2 * i + 1] = p[n - 1 - i], p[i]
        print(*p)
```

This approach ensures that no two consecutive elements form a valid division pair.
