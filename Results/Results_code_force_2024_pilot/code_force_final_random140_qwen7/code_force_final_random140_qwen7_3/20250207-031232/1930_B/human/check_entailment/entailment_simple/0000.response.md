### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the value of `n` for each test case and ensures that `n` is within the specified range.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program constructs a permutation `p` by alternating between even and odd numbers starting from 2 and 1 respectively.
   - This approach guarantees that no two consecutive pairs `(p_i, p_{i+1})` will both be divisible by their counterparts `(p_j, p_{j+1})` because even numbers are never followed by another even number and odd numbers are never followed by another odd number in the constructed sequence.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation `p` is printed in the required format.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the minimum value of `n` (which is 3) correctly since the construction method works for `n >= 3`.

Given these points, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement and produces valid permutations for all test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
