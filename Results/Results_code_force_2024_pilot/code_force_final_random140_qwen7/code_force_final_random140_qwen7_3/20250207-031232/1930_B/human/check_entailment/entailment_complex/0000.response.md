Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
2. The provided solution generates a sequence by alternating between even and odd numbers starting from 2. This means the sequence will look like \( [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, \ldots] \) for even \( n \) and \( [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, \ldots, n] \) for odd \( n \).
3. Let's analyze if this sequence satisfies the condition:
   - For any pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \), if \( p_i \) is even and \( p_j \) is odd, they cannot divide each other since an even number cannot divide an odd number.
   - If both \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) are either even or odd, they are consecutive in the sequence and thus cannot satisfy the division condition because the next number in the sequence (which would be the other type, even or odd) will not divide them due to the alternating pattern.
4. Therefore, the generated sequence meets the requirement of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
