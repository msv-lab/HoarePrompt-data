The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10³) and an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵), where the sum of all `n` values does not exceed 10⁵. For each test case, the function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `a` (where `a` is the input value for each test case), ensuring the sequence alternates between odd and even numbers. The function then prints this sequence for each test case.
