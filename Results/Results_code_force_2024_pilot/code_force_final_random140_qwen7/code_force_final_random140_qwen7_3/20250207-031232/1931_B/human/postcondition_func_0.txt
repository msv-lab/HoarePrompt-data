The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then sorts the list of integers and checks if the list is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If the list is sorted, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
