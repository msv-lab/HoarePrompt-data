Output State: **`i` is 3; `current_balance` is `current_balance + a[1] + a[3] - target`; `possible` is False**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `possible` to `False`, which does not affect the values of `i` or `current_balance`. The initial state of `i` being 3 and `current_balance` being `current_balance + a[1] + a[3] - target` remains unchanged.
