Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The initial state of `i` is `-1`.
   - The initial state of `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at `-1`, the loop will start executing when `i` becomes `0` (the first iteration).
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to `0` to start the loop.
   - `n` remains an input integer but must be greater than `0` for the loop to execute.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `current_balance`, `possible`, `t`, `target`, `a`, and `total_water` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `0`.
- `n` must be greater than `0`.

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
