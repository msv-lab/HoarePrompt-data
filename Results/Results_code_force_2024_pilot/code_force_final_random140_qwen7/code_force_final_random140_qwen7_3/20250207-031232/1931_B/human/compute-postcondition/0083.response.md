Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is 0
  - `current_balance` is less than 0
  - `possible` is False
- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - The loop head also contains the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - The value of `n` is not explicitly given, but it must be an integer greater than 0 (since `range(n)` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged, so it must still be greater than 1.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - The variables `current_balance` and `possible` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged.

### Final State:
- `i` is 1
- `current_balance` is less than 0
- `possible` is False
- `n` must be greater than 1

### Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False, `n` must be greater than 1**
