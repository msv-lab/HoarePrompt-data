Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

The code sets `possible` to `False`, which changes its value from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
