Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The elements in `arr` are either in non-decreasing order or there exists at least one index i where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`.
