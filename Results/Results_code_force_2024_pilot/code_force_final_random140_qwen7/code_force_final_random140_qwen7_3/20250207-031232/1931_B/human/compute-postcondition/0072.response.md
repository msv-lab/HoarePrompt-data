Output State: **`i` is -1, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + ... + a[n-2] - target`, `possible` is `True` if the condition `possible` is met, otherwise `False`, `t` is `t - n + 1`, `target` is now `total_water // n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `target` to be `total_water // n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
