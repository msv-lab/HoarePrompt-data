Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `-1`
   - `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + ... + a[n-2] - target`
   - `possible` is `True` if the condition `possible` is met, otherwise `False`
   - `t` is `t - n + 1`
   - `target` is `total_water // n`

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to adjust `t` for the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is `t - n + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.

5. **Determine the New Value of `t`**:
   - If `t - n + 1 >= 0`, then the loop can execute again.
   - Therefore, `t` should be set to `t - n + 1`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `-1`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + ... + a[n-2] - target`, `possible` is `True` if the condition `possible` is met, otherwise `False`, `t` is `t - n + 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`**
