Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `current_balance` is `current_balance + (a[n-1] - target)`, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`**

Explanation: The code sets the variable `possible` to `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `current_balance`, `t`, and `target` remain unchanged from their initial states.
