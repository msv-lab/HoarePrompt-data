Output State: **`i` is -1, `current_balance` is 0, `possible` is `True` if the condition `possible` is met, otherwise `False`, `t` is `t - n + 1`, `target` is now `total_water // n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `total_water` is the sum of the list `a**.

Explanation: The line `current_balance = 0` sets the value of `current_balance` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
