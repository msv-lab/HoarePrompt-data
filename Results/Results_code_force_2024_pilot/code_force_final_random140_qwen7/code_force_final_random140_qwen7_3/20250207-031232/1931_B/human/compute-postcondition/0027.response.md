Output State: **`t` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer input from the user, `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the new integer input from the user after each iteration. The list `arr` remains sorted after the if-else block executes in each iteration.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations (which is `t` initially), making it greater than 2 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 2\). The variable `n` and the list `arr` will be updated according to each new input during the loop's execution, but they will always be in a state where `arr` is sorted.
