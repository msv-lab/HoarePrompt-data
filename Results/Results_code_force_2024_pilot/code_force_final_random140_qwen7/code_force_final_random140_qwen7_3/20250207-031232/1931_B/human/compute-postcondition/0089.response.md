Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `current_balance` is `current_balance + a[1] - target`.
   - `possible` is False.
   - If `current_balance < 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 at the start of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.
   - The value of `current_balance` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `current_balance` within the loop.
   - `possible` remains False as there is no information suggesting it changes within the loop.
   - The condition `if current_balance < 0` still holds true if it was true at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `current_balance` is `current_balance + a[1] - target`, `possible` is False**.
