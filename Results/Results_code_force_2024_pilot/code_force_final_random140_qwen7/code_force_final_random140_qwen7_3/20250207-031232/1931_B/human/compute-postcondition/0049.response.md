Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `current_balance` is less than 0
   - `possible` is `False`
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `target` is `total_water // n`
   - The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop condition is `for i in range(n)`, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2`. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` will be `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to `n-1`.
   - `current_balance`, `possible`, `t`, and `target` are not directly controlled by the loop itself, so their values remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop (if statement) is not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`.

Given the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are only those related to the loop head, specifically `i` and `n`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and it was `n-2` at the end of the previous iteration, it will become `n-1` in the next iteration. There is no direct change mentioned for `n` in the loop head, so `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`**
