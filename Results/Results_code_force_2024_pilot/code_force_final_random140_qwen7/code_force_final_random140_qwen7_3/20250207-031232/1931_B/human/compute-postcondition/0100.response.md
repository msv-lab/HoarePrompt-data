Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `possible` remains False. The loop breaks out if `current_balance` becomes less than 0 at any point during the iterations, regardless of whether `possible` was True or False before the if-else block.
