Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `current_balance` is `a[i] - target`, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - 2`, `target` is `total_water // n`**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `possible`. None of the other variables (`i`, `current_balance`, `t`, or `target`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
