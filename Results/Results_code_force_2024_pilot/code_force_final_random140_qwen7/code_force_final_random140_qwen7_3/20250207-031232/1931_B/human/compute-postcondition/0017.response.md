Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'.

Since the value of `t`, `n`, and `arr` do not affect the output of this specific print statement, the output remains constant regardless of their values.

Output: **NO**
