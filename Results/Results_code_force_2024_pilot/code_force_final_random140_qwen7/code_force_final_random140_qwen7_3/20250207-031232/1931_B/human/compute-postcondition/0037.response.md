Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element in list `a` and `target`, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - 1`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `total_water`. The other variables (`i`, `current_balance`, `possible`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
