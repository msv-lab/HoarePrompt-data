Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation. The list `arr` is updated to be sorted, but the specific values within `arr` depend on the original input string and cannot be determined without knowing the exact input.
