Output State: **`i` is 1, `current_balance` is `current_balance + a[1] - target`, `possible` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block indicated in the initial state, the `break` statement simply indicates that we are exiting the most internal loop or conditional context. The values of the variables `i`, `current_balance`, and `possible` remain unchanged.
