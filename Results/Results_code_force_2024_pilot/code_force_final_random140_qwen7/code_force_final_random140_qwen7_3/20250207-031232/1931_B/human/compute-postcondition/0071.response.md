Output State: **`i` is -1, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + ... + a[n-2] - target`, `possible` is `True` if the condition `possible` is met, otherwise `False`, `t` is `t - n + 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `total_water = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `total_water`. The other variables (`i`, `current_balance`, `possible`, `t`, `target`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
