Output State: **`t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the new integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, and the second instance of `n` (which is a new integer input) remain unchanged. The list `arr` is updated to be sorted.
