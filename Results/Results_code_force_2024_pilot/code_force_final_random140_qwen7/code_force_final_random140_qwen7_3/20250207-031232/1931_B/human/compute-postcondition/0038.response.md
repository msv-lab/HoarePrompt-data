Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element in list `a` and `target`, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `total_water // n` to `target`. The other variables (`i`, `current_balance`, `possible`, `t`, and `total_water`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
