Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. The function then returns whether the given conditions are met for each test case.**

Note: The function does not explicitly take `n` and the list `a_i` as parameters but rather processes them within the function body according to the described constraints.
