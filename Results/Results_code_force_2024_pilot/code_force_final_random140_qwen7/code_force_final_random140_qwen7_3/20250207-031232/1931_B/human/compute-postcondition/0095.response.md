Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `possible` is False, and the loop breaks out if `current_balance` becomes less than 0 at any point during the iterations.**

In this final state, the variable `i` will have reached its upper limit `n-1`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The `current_balance` will be the cumulative result of adding `a[i] - target` for each iteration where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. If at any point during these iterations, `current_balance` becomes less than 0, `possible` will remain False and the loop will exit early. Otherwise, `possible` will still be False as the loop does not change it to True under any circumstances.
