You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and there are n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and the sum of a_i is divisible by n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        total_water = sum(a)
        
        target = total_water // n
        
        current_balance = 0
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_balance += a[i] - target
            if current_balance < 0:
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, `i` will be `-1`, `current_balance` will be the overall balance calculated as the sum of differences between each element in list `a` and `target` for all `n` values processed, and `possible` will be `True` if the balance never goes below 0 during any of the iterations; otherwise, it will remain `False`. The variable `target` will be updated based on the `total_water` which is the sum of all elements in list `a` divided by `n` for each test case, and `total_water` itself will be recalculated for each new value of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. The function then returns whether the given conditions are met for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
