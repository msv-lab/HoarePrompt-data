Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. The function returns nothing directly but processes the data according to the given conditions.**

This functionality describes a function that iterates over multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers `a_i`. It checks if the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n` and processes the data accordingly without returning any direct output.
