Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer. The initial condition for `t` remains unchanged, meaning `t` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the input converted to an integer.
