Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `current_balance` is `a[i] - target`, `possible` is `True`, `t` is `t - 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`**

Explanation: The code updates the `current_balance` by adding the difference between the element at index `i` of list `a` and the `target`. Since `i` was initially `n-1`, after executing `current_balance += a[i] - target`, `i` is decremented to `n-2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
