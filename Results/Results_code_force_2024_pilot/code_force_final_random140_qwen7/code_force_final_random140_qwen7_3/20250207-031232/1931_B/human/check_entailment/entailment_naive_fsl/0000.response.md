Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program checks if the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this condition alone does not guarantee that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the sum of the water in all containers divided by the number of containers (`n`) is equal to any of the elements in the array. This is because, after performing the operations, each container should end up with the average amount of water, which is `sum(a_i) / n`.

Here's a counterexample to show why the provided program is incorrect:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  4
  2 2 2 2
  4
  2 3 2 2
  4
  2 2 3 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  NO
  NO
  ```

- Actual Output (using the provided program):
  ```
  YES
  YES
  YES
  ```

In the second and third test cases, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because the array is sorted, but it is not possible to make all containers have the same amount of water. For example, in the second test case, the array `[2, 3, 2, 2]` cannot be made uniform by pouring water between the containers.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
