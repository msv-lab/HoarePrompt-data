Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the array of water units in each container can be sorted in non-decreasing order. If the array is sorted, it implies that the water units can be evenly distributed among the containers through the allowed operations (pouring water from one container to another where the source index is less than the destination index).

However, the logic in the program is flawed. Sorting the array and checking if it is in non-decreasing order does not guarantee that the water can be evenly distributed. Instead, the correct approach is to check if the average amount of water per container is an integer. This is because, with the given operations, we can only redistribute water in a way that maintains the total sum of water and ensures that the final distribution is uniform across all containers.

Given the constraints and the problem statement, the correct solution should involve calculating the average amount of water per container and checking if it is an integer. If the average is an integer, it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers.

Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
