Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the list of water units in the containers is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this approach is incorrect because the problem does not require the water units to be sorted. Instead, it requires making the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another as many times as needed.

Given the constraints and the operations allowed (pouring water from one container to another), it is always possible to equalize the water units across all containers if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. This is because we can distribute the total water evenly among all containers.

The provided solution does not correctly address the problem's requirements. It only checks if the array is sorted, which is not relevant to the problem.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
