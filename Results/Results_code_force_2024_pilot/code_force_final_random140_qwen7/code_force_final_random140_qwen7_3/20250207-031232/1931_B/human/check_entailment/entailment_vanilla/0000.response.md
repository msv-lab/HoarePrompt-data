### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index must be less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, the average amount of water per container is an integer. This means that if we can distribute the water evenly, each container should end up with this average amount of water.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - The provided solution sorts the array `arr` of water amounts.
   - It then checks if the sorted array is non-decreasing (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next).
   - If the array is non-decreasing, it implies that the water can be poured from the containers with more water to those with less water until all containers have the same amount of water, which is the average amount.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The sorting approach works because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, meaning the average amount of water per container is an integer.
   - The check `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)))` ensures that the water distribution can be achieved through the allowed operations.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the provided code correctly determines if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers.
   - The code handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
- The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the logical steps outlined above.

**Correctness: True**
