Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution checks if the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this condition is not sufficient to determine whether it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the allowed operations.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by `n` and then verify if all elements can eventually become equal. Given that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, it is always possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, which is the average amount of water per container.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        avg_water = sum(arr) // n
        if all(a == avg_water for a in arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This program calculates the average amount of water per container and checks if every container already has that amount. If so, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This approach correctly determines the possibility of making all containers have the same amount of water.
