Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. The logic for determining the MEX value based on the optimal play of both players is flawed. Here’s why:

1. **Game Rules Not Fully Implemented**: The program does not simulate the turns where Alice and Bob pick elements from the array `a` alternately. Instead, it just counts occurrences of each number in `a` and tries to deduce the MEX value based on these counts, which doesn't reflect the actual game dynamics.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**: The program assumes that the optimal strategy can be determined solely by counting occurrences, but it fails to account for the fact that Alice and Bob will strategically pick elements to maximize and minimize the MEX value respectively.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game as described, ensuring that Alice and Bob make their optimal moves. Here’s a more accurate approach:

```python
def mex(arr):
    seen = set(arr)
    i = 0
    while i in seen:
        i += 1
    return i

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice's turn: She will always pick the smallest available number
        # Bob's turn: He will pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX
        c = []
        a = arr[:]
        for _ in range(n):
            if len(a) > 0:
                c.append(min(a))
                a.remove(min(a))
            if len(a) > 0:
                a.remove(min(a))
        
        print(mex(c))

func()
```

This code simulates the game correctly by ensuring that Alice and Bob follow their respective strategies and calculates the MEX value accurately.
