### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a` to maximize and minimize the MEX of the resulting array `c`, respectively.
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`.
   - Bob can only pick elements from `a` without appending them to `c`.
   - The goal is to determine the final MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally.

2. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice starts by picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c`.
   - Bob then picks elements from `a` but does not append them to `c`.
   - The game continues until `a` is empty.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should try to ensure that as many small numbers as possible are included in `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should try to remove as many small numbers as possible from `a` before they can be appended to `c`.

4. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code uses a dictionary `counter` to count occurrences of each element in the input array `arr`.
   - It iterates through numbers from `0` to `n-1` and checks the count of each number.
   - If a number `i` is not present (`counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once and hasn't been set yet (`not once`), it sets `ans` to `i + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `ans` to `i`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the code does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players.
   - Specifically, the code assumes that the first missing number (or the next number after the last unique number) will be the MEX, which is not always correct.
   - The optimal strategy would involve more complex decision-making based on the counts and the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**:
  - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
  - Each test case consists of \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)) and an array `arr` of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).

- **Key Observations**:
  - The code does not simulate the actual game process where Alice and Bob take turns.
  - Instead, it simply finds the smallest number that is not present in the array or the next number after the last unique number, which does not account for the optimal strategy.

- **Example Analysis**:
  - Consider the example given in the problem statement:
    - Test Case 1: `n = 4`, `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
      - Alice can choose `1` and append it to `c`, making `c = [1]`.
      - Bob can choose `0` and delete it from `a`, making `a = [0, 1]`.
      - Alice can choose `0` and append it to `c`, making `c = [1, 0]`.
      - Bob can choose `1` and delete it from `a`, making `a = []`.
      - The MEX of `c = [1, 0]` is `2`.
    - The code incorrectly sets `ans` to `3` because it does not simulate the game process.

- **Conclusion**:
  - The provided solution does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players.
  - The code assumes a simple condition to determine the MEX, which is not sufficient for the optimal game strategy.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game, and therefore, it is incorrect.
