Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `arr` must have at least one element.
- `counter[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` exists in `counter`, otherwise it is set to 1.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in arr:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `arr`.
- For the loop to execute again, `arr` must still contain at least one element.
- The variable `i` is an element from `arr`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `arr` contains at least one element.
   - Therefore, `arr` must still have at least one element.

2. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `arr` still has at least one element.
   - The value of `i` does not affect the condition for the next iteration directly, but it will be used within the loop body.

### Final State
State: **`arr` must have at least one element.**

This is the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The specific value of `i` is not relevant to the continuation of the loop, as long as `arr` has at least one element.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`arr` must have at least one element.**
