Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is either 1 or 2.
   - `once` is either True or False.
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `n` is greater than 1.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Analyze the possible states at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 or 2, and `n` is greater than 1, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` could be 1 or 2, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.

5. **Update the states**:
   - If `i` was 1, it will become 2.
   - If `i` was 2, it will become 3 (but since `n` is greater than 1, this case is not possible as the loop would have already terminated).

6. **Final state after the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 2 (since it was either 1 or 2 and it increments by 1).
   - `n` remains the same and is still greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`ans` is either 1 or 2, `once` is either True or False, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1**.
