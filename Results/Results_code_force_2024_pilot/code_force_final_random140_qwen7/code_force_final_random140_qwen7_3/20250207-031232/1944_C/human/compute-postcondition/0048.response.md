Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or 2, `once` is either True or False, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `n` is greater than 1. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, then `ans` is 2, `once` is True, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 1, `once` is False, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1.
