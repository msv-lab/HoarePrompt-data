Output State: **`once` is False, `ans` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer, `i` is 0, `t` is undefined, `next_i` is undefined, the current value of counter at index `i` is 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `once`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, `t`, `next_i`, and the current value of the counter at index `i`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
