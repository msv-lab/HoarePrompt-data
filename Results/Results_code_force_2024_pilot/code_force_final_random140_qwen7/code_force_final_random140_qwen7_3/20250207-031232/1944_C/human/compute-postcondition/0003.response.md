Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking a single line of space-separated integers as input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings, and then `map(int, ...)` converts each string to an integer. The original conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
