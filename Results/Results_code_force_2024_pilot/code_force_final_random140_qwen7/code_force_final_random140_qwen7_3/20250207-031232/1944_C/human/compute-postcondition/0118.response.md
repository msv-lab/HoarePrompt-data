Output State: **`ans` is 3, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as their initial states.
