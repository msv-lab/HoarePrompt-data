Output State: **`ans` is either 1 or 2, `once` is either True or False, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking input as a string, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `ans`, `once`, `i`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
