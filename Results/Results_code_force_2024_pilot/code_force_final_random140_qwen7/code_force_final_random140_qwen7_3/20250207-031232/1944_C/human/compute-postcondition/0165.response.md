Output State: **`once` is either `True` or `False`, `ans` is `1`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2`, `t` is undefined, `next_i` is undefined and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `once`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, `t`, and `next_i`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
