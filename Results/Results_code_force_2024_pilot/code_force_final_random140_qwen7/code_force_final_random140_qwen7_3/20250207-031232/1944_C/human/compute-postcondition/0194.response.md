Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of an integer t, followed by n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. For each test case, it returns information based on the given t, n, and array a.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer t, an integer n, and an array a of n integers. The function processes these inputs and returns specific information related to them, though the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information.
