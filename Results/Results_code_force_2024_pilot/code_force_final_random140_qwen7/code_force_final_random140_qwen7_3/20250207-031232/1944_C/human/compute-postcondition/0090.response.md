Output State: **`once` is False, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers, and the count of the current element `i` in `arr` is 1, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
