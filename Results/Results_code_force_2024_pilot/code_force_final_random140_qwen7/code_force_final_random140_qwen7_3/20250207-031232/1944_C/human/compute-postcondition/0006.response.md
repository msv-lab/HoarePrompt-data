Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `counter[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` exists in `counter`, otherwise it is set to 1.**

In this case, the code updates the `counter` dictionary by incrementing the count of the key `i` by 1 if `i` already exists in the dictionary. If `i` does not exist, it sets `counter[i]` to 1. The initial state of `arr` is unchanged, and the exact value of `counter[i]` depends on whether `i` was already a key in `counter` before the execution of the code.
