Output State: **`ans` is 1, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers.**

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the current value of `i`, which is 1, to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
