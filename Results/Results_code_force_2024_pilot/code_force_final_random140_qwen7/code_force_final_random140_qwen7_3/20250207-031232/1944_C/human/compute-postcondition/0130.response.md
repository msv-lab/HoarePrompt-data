Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is either 3, 4, or 5, `counter` is a dictionary with counts of elements in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n-1`, and `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value (which is greater than 0).

Given the above points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**State: **`ans` is either 3, 4, or 5, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n-1`, and `t` must be greater than 1**
