Output State: **`ans` is either 1 or 2, `once` is either True or False, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The other variables (`ans`, `once`, `i`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is now an integer obtained from user input, while the conditions for `ans`, `once`, `i`, and `t` remain as specified in the initial state.
