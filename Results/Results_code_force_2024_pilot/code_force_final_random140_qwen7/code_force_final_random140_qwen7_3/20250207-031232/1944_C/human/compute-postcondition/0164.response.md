Output State: **`once` is either `True` or `False`, `ans` is `1`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2`, `t` is undefined, `next_i` is undefined**

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to `ans`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `once`, `n`, `t`, and `next_i` remain unchanged.
