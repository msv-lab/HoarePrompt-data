Output State: **`counter[next_i]` is updated to `counter.get(next_i, 0) + 1`, `counter[i]` is updated to `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`, `i` is the next element in `arr`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `counter[i]` by incrementing it by 1 using the `counter.get(i, 0) + 1` expression. This means that the count for the element `i` in the dictionary `counter` is incremented by 1. Similarly, the value of `counter[next_i]` is also updated by incrementing it by 1. The variable `i` remains the next element in the list `arr`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
