Output State: **`ans` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, the current value of `counter[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the loop or conditional block is exited. Therefore, the values of `ans`, `counter`, `once`, `n`, `i`, `t`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
