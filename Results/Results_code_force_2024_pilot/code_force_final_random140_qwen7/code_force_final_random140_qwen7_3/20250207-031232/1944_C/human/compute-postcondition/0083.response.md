Output State: **`ans` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, the current value of `counter[i]` is 0, `ans` is now 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
