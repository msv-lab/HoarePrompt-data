Output State: **`ans` is 1, `once` is False, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to `ans`. The values of `once` and `n` remain unchanged. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2, but since the increment is not shown in the output state, we only include the updated value of `ans` and the fact that `i` was incremented.
