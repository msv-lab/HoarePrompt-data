Output State: **`ans` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is False, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers.**

The code `once = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `once`. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `counter`, `n`, `t`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
