Output State: **`counter[next_i]` is updated to `counter.get(next_i, 0) + 1`, `counter[i]` is updated to `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `counter[i]` to the current value of `counter.get(i, 0)` plus 1. Since `i` is equal to `next_i` from the initial state, both `counter[next_i]` and `counter[i]` are updated to their respective counts plus one. The initial state's condition that `counter[i]` is updated to `counter.get(next_i, 0) + 1` remains true, and since `i` is `next_i`, `counter[i]` is also updated accordingly.
