Output State: **`ans` is either 3, 4, or 5, `once` is True, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `t` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `counter` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes the `counter` variable as an empty dictionary. This means that all other variables retain their initial states, and the `counter` now holds no key-value pairs.
