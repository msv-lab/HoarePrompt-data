Output State: **`ans` is 3, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `ans = i` assigns the value of `i`, which is 3, to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
