Output State: **`once` is either `True` or `False`, `ans` is `1`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2`, `t` is undefined, `next_i` is undefined**

Explanation: The code `ans = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to `ans`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1 because it was previously set to 1 and is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
