Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers, and if the count of the current element `i` in `arr` is exactly 1, `once` is set to True, otherwise, the loop or if statement continues without changing `ans` or `once`.
