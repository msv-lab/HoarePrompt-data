Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(n)` to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1). This ensures that the range function generates at least one value for `i`.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Adjust the given states**:
   - The state before the loop starts mentions that `once` is False, `ans` is 0, `n` is undefined, `i` is undefined, `t` is undefined, and `next_i` is undefined.
   - Since `i` is undefined, it will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - `n` must be defined and must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be a positive integer and `i` will start from 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`once` is False, `ans` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer, `i` is 0, `t` is undefined, `next_i` is undefined**
