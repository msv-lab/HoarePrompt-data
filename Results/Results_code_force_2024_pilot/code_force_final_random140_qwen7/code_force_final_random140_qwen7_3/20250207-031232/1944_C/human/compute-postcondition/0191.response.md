Based on the initial state provided:

- `once` is either `True` or `False`.
- `ans` is explicitly set to `3`.
- `i` is set to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `t` is undefined.
- `next_i` is undefined.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is explicitly given as `3`.

Output: **3**
