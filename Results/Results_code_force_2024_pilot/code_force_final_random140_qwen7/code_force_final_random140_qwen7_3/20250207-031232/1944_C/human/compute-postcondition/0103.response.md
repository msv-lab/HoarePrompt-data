Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is 0
   - `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`
   - `once` is False
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `arr` must be a list of integers

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop condition is `i < n`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming no break or other conditions alter `i`).
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Given the above points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from 0 to 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers**.
