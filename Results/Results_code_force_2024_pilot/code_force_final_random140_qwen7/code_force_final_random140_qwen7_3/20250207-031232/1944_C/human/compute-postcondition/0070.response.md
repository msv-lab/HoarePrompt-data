Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in arr`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`.

2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to start.

3. **Check the initial state**:
   - `counter` is an empty dictionary.
   - `ans` is either 1 or 2.
   - `once` is either True or False.
   - `i` is 2 (this is not used in the loop, but it is part of the initial state).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `arr`, `arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `arr` must contain at least one element.

So, the final state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`counter` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `once` is either True or False, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must contain at least one element**.
