State: **`ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `i < n` must be true.
3. Initially, `i` is set to 0 (the default starting value for `range(n)`).
4. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
5. The variables `ans` and `once` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the given information.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being 0 and `n` being greater than 0.
