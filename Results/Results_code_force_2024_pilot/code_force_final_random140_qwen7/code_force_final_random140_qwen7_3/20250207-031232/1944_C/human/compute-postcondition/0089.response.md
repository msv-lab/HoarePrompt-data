Output State: **`once` is False, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers, and the count of the current element `i` in `arr` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `once = True` does not change the value of `once` since it was already set to `True`. However, the problem statement mentions that `once` is initially `True`, and after executing the line, it remains `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
