Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is False, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers. If the count of the current element `i` in `arr` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the count of the current element `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` remains False, or the count of the current element `i` in `arr` is not 1, the `counter` dictionary and other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or 2, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is either 3 or 4, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
