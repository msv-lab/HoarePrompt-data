Output State: **`ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 0) to `ans`. All other variables (`once`, `n`, and `counter.get(i, 0)`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
