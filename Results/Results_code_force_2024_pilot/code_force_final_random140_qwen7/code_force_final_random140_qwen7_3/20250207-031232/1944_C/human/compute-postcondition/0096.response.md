Output State: **`ans` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned in the code snippet, the variables retain their initial states, and the only change is the indication of breaking out of the loop or condition.
