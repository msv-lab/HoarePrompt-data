Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive. The precondition that each test case consists of `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) and an array `a` of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n` remains valid. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
