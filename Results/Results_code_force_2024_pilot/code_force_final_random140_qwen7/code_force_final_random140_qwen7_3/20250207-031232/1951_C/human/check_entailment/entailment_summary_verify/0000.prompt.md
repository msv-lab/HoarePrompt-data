You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Output

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets (`m`), the maximum total price (`k`), and a list of ticket prices (`prices`). It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the number of test cases (`t`) is at least as many as the test cases processed, and for each test case, it correctly handles the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`, producing a result from `func_1` for each.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets purchased on a day causes the price increase for subsequent days. Let's consider the following example:

### Example Input:
```
3 2 5
8 6 4
```

### Expected Output:
To buy 5 tickets with the given constraints, we need to consider the following strategy:
- On the first day, we can buy 2 tickets at 8 each, costing 16. This increases the prices for the next day to [10, 4].
- On the second day, we can buy 3 tickets at 4 each, costing 12. This increases the prices for the next day to [10].

Thus, the total cost should be `16 + 12 = 28`.

However, the provided program does not account for the price increase correctly. It simply sorts the prices and buys tickets without considering the cumulative effect of buying tickets on subsequent days.

### Program Behavior:
The program sorts the prices and buys tickets based on the sorted order, which does not take into account the price increase mechanism. Therefore, it will not produce the correct result for this input.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle the price increase mechanism, it is incorrect for at least one potential case. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
