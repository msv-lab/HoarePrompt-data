Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days with a maximum of `m` tickets per day.
   - It sorts the list of prices, which is unnecessary because the algorithm does not rely on the order of prices but rather on the cumulative effect of buying tickets.
   - It iterates through each day, calculating how many tickets can be bought at the current price without exceeding `k` tickets.
   - The cost is calculated by multiplying the number of tickets to be bought by the current price.
   - The function breaks out of the loop once `k` tickets are bought.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles reading input and calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of prices.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - Sorting the prices list is unnecessary and can be removed. The algorithm does not depend on the order of prices but rather on the cumulative effect of buying tickets.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It always buys tickets at the lowest available price first, which might not lead to the minimum cost. For example, consider the case where the prices are `[10, 1, 10]` and `k = 2`. Buying 2 tickets at the first price of 10 would cost 20, but buying 1 ticket at 1 and then 1 ticket at 10 would cost 11, which is cheaper.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost to buy up to `i` tickets on day `j`.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program using a dynamic programming approach:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(k + 1):
            for x in range(min(m, j) + 1):
                if j >= x:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-x] + x * prices[i-1])
    
    return dp[n][k]

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
        print(result)

func_2()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has logical flaws and does not guarantee the minimum cost. Therefore, the given program is **Incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
