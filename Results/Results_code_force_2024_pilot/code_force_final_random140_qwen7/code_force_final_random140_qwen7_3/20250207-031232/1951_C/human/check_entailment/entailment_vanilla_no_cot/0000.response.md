Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the problem's constraints and logic. Specifically, it does not account for the dynamic pricing increase when purchasing tickets on a given day. Here’s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Price Increase**: The function `func_1` does not update the prices after purchasing tickets on a particular day. It simply sorts the prices and buys tickets without considering the increase in price due to previous purchases.

2. **Sorting the Prices**: Sorting the prices at the beginning of the loop is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results because the prices should be updated dynamically based on the number of tickets purchased each day.

3. **Buying Tickets Without Considering Future Price Increases**: The function assumes that buying tickets today will not affect future prices, which is not true according to the problem statement.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a priority queue to keep track of the minimum cost to buy tickets while considering the price increases.

Here’s a corrected version of the solution using dynamic programming:

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    """Calculates the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

    Args:
        n: The number of sale days.
        m: The maximum number of tickets purchasable each day.
        k: The total number of tickets to buy.
        prices: A list of prices per ticket for each day.

    Returns:
        The minimum amount of money needed to purchase k tickets.
    """
    pq = []
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the cost of buying m tickets on day i
        cost = prices[i] * min(m, k)
        heappush(pq, (cost, prices[i]))
        k -= min(m, k)
        if k <= 0:
            break
    total_cost = 0
    while k > 0 and pq:
        cost, price = heappop(pq)
        tickets_to_buy = min(k, m)
        total_cost += tickets_to_buy * price
        k -= tickets_to_buy
    return total_cost

def func_2():
    """Handles input and output for multiple test cases."""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

This corrected version uses a priority queue to keep track of the minimum cost to buy tickets while considering the price increases due to previous purchases.
