Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to calculate the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets.
   - It takes four parameters: `n` (number of sale days), `m` (maximum tickets purchasable each day), `k` (total number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of ticket prices for each day).
   - The function sorts the `prices` list, which is unnecessary because the algorithm does not rely on the order of prices but rather on the cumulative effect of buying tickets.
   - It iterates through each day, determining how many tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`), calculating the cost, and updating the total cost and the number of tickets bought.
   - The function breaks out of the loop once the required number of tickets (`k`) has been purchased.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads the list of prices.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Sorting the Prices List**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the `prices` list, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The algorithm should work without sorting because the logic depends on the cumulative effect of buying tickets, not on the order of prices.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the price increase after purchasing tickets. The function buys tickets at the current day's price and then moves to the next day without considering the increased prices due to previous purchases.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to keep track of the cumulative effect of buying tickets and adjust the prices accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    for i in range(n):
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        if tickets_to_buy > 0:
            cost = tickets_to_buy * prices[i]
            total_cost += cost
            tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
            # Increase the price for subsequent days
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                prices[j] += tickets_to_buy
        if tickets_bought == k:
            break
    return total_cost

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
        print(result)

# Example usage
func_2()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it incorrectly simulates the price increase and unnecessarily sorts the prices list. The corrected version above addresses these issues and should provide the correct solution.

**Correctness: False**
