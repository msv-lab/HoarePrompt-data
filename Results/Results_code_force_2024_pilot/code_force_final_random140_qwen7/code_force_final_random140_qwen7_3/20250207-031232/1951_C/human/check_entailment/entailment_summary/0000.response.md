Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day and the price increase after buying tickets.
- The `func_2` function correctly handles reading the input for multiple test cases and calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
- The `func_1` function sorts the prices in ascending order and then iteratively buys tickets starting from the cheapest day until `k` tickets are purchased. This approach ensures that the tickets are bought at the lowest possible cost.
- Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, sorting the prices and buying tickets from the cheapest day first is an effective strategy to minimize the total cost.
- The provided examples and the logic in both functions align with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
