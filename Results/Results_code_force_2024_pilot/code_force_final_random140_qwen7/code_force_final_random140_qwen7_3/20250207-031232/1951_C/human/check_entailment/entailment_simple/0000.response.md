Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_1` calculates the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days with a maximum of `m` tickets per day. It sorts the prices and iteratively buys tickets while updating the total cost and reducing the number of tickets to buy.
3. `func_2` handles the input and output for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices, calls `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost, and prints the result.
4. The logic in both functions appears to be correct according to the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the annotations and the logic described, the program should work as intended to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
