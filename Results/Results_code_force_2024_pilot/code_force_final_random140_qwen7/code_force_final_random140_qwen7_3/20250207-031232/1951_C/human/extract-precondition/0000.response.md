Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). prices is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i represents the price per ticket on day i, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
