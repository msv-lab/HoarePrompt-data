Output State: **All tickets have been bought, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, `total_cost` is the sum of the costs calculated for each day until `tickets_bought` reached `k`, and `i` is the last index `n-1` of the `prices` list.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `tickets_bought` will equal `k`, meaning all the tickets have been purchased. The variable `i` will be the last index of the `prices` list, which is `n-1`, as the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The `total_cost` will be the cumulative cost of purchasing the tickets over the sale days, with the number of tickets bought each day being the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`). The loop breaks once `tickets_bought` reaches `k`, ensuring that no unnecessary iterations occur after all tickets are bought.
