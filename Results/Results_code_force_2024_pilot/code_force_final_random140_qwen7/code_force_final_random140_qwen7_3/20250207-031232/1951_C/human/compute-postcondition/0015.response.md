Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` to the variable `result`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information is that `result` now holds the return value of the function call.
