Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an integer input.
- `m` is an integer input.
- `k` is an integer input.
- `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

The `print(result)` statement will print the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the output of `func_1` with the given parameters.

Output: **result (the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices))**
