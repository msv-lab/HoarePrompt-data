Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). prices is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i represents the price per ticket on day i, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function handles input and output for multiple test cases.**

The given code snippet is a docstring that describes how the function should handle input and output for multiple test cases. It does not modify any variables or perform any operations. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
