Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list named `prices` by taking a single line of input, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
