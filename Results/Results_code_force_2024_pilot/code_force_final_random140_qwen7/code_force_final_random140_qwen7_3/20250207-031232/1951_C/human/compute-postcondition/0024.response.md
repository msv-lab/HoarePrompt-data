Output State: **`i` is 2, `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `tickets_to_buy * prices[i]` to the variable `cost`. Given that `i` is 2, `cost` is calculated as `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`. The values of `tickets_to_buy` and `prices[2]` remain as they were in the initial state.
