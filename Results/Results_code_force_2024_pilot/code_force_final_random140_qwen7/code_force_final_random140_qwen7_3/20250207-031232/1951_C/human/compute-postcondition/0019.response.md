Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). Additionally, it accepts a list `prices` of `n` positive integers, where each integer `a_i` represents the price per ticket on day `i`, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input data according to the given constraints and relationships.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value.
