Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` to the variable `result`. The function `func_1` takes four arguments: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. Since the function call returns a value, `result` now holds that value. However, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remain unchanged from their initial states.
