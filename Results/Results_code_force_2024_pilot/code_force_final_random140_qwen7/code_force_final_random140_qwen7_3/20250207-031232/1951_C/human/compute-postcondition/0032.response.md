Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of sale days), `m` (a positive integer representing the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (a positive integer representing the total number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of `n` positive integers where each integer represents the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days). It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, which is the sum of the costs calculated for each day until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.**
