Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This sets `t` to be a positive integer representing the number of test cases. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is not specified but implied to be unchanged and valid for their roles in handling multiple test cases.
