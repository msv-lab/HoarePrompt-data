Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `m` is the second integer input.
- `k` is the third integer input.
- `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

The print statement `print(result)` will print the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise value of `result`. However, we know it is the return value of this function call.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices))**
