Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.
   - `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[1]`.
   - `total_cost` is `total_cost + cost`.
   - `tickets_bought` is `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`.
   - If `tickets_bought` equals `k`, we break out of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will run as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the same as before**.
