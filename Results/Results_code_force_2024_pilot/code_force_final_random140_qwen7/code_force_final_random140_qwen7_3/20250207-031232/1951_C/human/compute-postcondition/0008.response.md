Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**.

This means that the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` retain their initial conditions except that `n`, `m`, and `k` are now assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces. The variable `result` is also updated to the return value of the function `func_1` with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`.
