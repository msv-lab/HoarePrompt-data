Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `L1[i]`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `2` to `L1[i] + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `L1` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the list `L1`.
   - `j` is an integer.
   - `res` is a list with one additional element which is equal to `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)`. This element is added to `res` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was one value within the range `[2, L1[i] + 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and must still be within the range `[2, L1[i] + 1)`.

5. **Check the range**:
   - If `j` was the maximum value in the range, i.e., `L1[i]`, then the loop will terminate.
   - Otherwise, `j` will be incremented by 1 and will be `L1[i] + 1`.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `L1` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is updated to `L1[i] + 1` if it was the maximum value, otherwise, it is incremented by 1.
   - `res` remains unchanged as no new elements are added to `res` in this iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`L1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `L1`, `j` is an integer equal to `L1[i] + 1`, and `res` is a list with one additional element which is equal to `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)`**.
