Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing up to three elements, `i` is 3, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[i]` is at least 1. If `L1[i] % j == 0` for any `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i]`, then we append `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to `res` and break out of the loop.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` has been incremented to 3, meaning the loop has processed the first three elements of `L1`. The list `res` will contain up to three elements, each calculated based on the condition inside the loop. The values of `t`, `x`, and `L1` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
