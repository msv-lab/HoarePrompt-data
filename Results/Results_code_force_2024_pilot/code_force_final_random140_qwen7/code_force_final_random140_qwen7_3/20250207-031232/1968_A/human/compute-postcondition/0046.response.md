Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing multiple elements, `i` is 2, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[i]` is at least 4. If `L1[i] % j == 0` for any `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i]`, then we append `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to `res` and break out of the loop.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the elements of `L1` starting from index `i = 0`. After the loop has executed 3 times, `i` is now 2. For the loop to continue, `L1[2]` must be at least 4, and there must exist some `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[2]` such that `L1[2] % j == 0`. When such a `j` is found, `L1[2] // j * (j - 1)` is appended to `res`, and the loop breaks. The values of `t`, `x`, `res` (except for the newly appended element if applicable), and `L1` (except for the updated `L1[2]`) remain unchanged.
