Output State: **`res` now contains the value `L1[1] // 2 * (2 - 1)`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `t` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `L1` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends to `res` the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` starts from 2, the expression evaluates to `L1[1] // 2 * (2 - 1)`, which simplifies to `L1[1] // 2 * 1` or simply `L1[1] // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
