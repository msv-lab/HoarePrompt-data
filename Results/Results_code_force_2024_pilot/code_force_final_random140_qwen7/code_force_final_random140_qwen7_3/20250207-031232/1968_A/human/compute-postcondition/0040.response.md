Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `2` to `L1[i] + 1`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `res` remains 0.5
   - `i` remains 1
   - `j` remains 2
   - `t` remains unchanged
   - `x` remains unchanged
   - `L1` remains unchanged

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `L1[i] + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 3.

5. **Check Loop Termination Condition**: We need to ensure that `j` does not exceed `L1[i] + 1`. Given `i` is 1, we need to check the value of `L1[1]` to determine the upper limit for `j`.

6. **Adjust States**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which will be incremented to 3. The other states (`res`, `i`, `t`, `x`, `L1`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`res` remains 0.5, `i` remains 1, `j` is 3, `t` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, and `L1` remains unchanged**.
