Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `num`. The variables `t` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
