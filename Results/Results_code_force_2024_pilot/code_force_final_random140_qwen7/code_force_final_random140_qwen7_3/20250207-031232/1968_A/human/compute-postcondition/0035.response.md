Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing one additional element, `i` is 1, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[i]` is at least 1. If `L1[i] % j == 0`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program after the if-else block executes. It indicates that `L1[i]` is at least 1, and if the condition `L1[i] % j == 0` is met, the loop or if statement is broken.
