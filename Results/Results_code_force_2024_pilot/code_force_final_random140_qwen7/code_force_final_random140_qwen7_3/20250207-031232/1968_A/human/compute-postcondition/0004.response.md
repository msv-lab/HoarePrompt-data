Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer, `L1` is a list containing one element which is an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `num` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends an integer entered by the user (using `int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))` to the list `L1`. Since `i` was initially 0, `i + 1` becomes 1, and the user is prompted to enter the first entry. After the input is taken, `L1` now contains one element, which is the integer entered by the user. All other variables remain unchanged except for `i`, which is incremented by 1.
