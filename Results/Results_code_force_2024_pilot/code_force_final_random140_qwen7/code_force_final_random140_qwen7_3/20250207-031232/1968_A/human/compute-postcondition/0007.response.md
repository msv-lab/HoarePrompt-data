Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
   - `L1` is a list containing two elements which are integers entered by the user.
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `num` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < num`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 4) must still be less than `num`. Therefore, `num` must be greater than 4.

5. **Keep other states unchanged**: The states of `t`, `x`, `L1`, and `res` do not change based on the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing two elements which are integers entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 4, `num` is an input integer greater than 4.**

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing two elements which are integers entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 4, `num` is an input integer greater than 4**
