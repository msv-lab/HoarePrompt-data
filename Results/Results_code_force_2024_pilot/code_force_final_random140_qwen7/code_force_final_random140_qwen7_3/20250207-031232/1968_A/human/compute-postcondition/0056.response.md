Output State: **`L1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `L1`, `j` is an integer equal to `L1[i] + 1`, and `res` is a list with two elements where the second element is equal to `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `L1`, `i`, `j`, and `res`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
