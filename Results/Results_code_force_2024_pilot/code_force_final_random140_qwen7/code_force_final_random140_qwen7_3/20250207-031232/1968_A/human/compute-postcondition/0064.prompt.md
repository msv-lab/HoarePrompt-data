Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and all the elements in `L1` are the integers entered by the user during the loop's iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each being an integer input by the user, and `i` will be set to `num + 1`. The variables `t`, `x`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(num):
    for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
        if L1[i] % j == 0:
            res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing multiple elements, `i` is `num`, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and all the elements in `L1` are the integers entered by the user during the loop's iterations.

**Explanation:**
After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `num` because the loop increments `i` from 0 up to `num-1`. During each iteration of the loop, for each `L1[i]`, the loop checks every integer `j` from 2 to `L1[i]` (inclusive). If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, it appends `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res` and breaks out of the loop. This process is repeated for each element in `L1` until `i` reaches `num`. Therefore, `res` will contain multiple elements, one for each `L1[i]` that satisfied the condition `L1[i] % j == 0` for some `j` between 2 and `L1[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `L1`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing multiple elements, `i` is 2, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[i]` is at least 4. If `L1[i] % j == 0` for any `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i]`, then we append `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to `res` and break out of the loop.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the elements of `L1` starting from index `i = 0`. After the loop has executed 3 times, `i` is now 2. For the loop to continue, `L1[2]` must be at least 4, and there must exist some `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[2]` such that `L1[2] % j == 0`. When such a `j` is found, `L1[2] // j * (j - 1)` is appended to `res`, and the loop breaks. The values of `t`, `x`, `res` (except for the newly appended element if applicable), and `L1` (except for the updated `L1[2]`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `L1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `L1`, `j` is an integer equal to `L1[i] + num - 1`, and `res` is a list with `num` elements. Each element in `res` is calculated as `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` if `L1[i] % j == 0`, otherwise it is `None`. Since the loop runs from `j = 2` to `j = L1[i] + 1`, the final value of `j` will be `L1[i] + num - 1`. Therefore, the last element of `res` will be `(L1[i] // (L1[i] + num - 1)) * ((L1[i] + num - 1) - 1)`. All previous elements in `res` will follow the same pattern based on the value of `j` during each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
