Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing three elements (the original two plus one new element entered by the user), `res` is an empty list, `i` is 4, `num` is an input integer greater than 4, a new element is appended to `L1` which is the integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code appends an integer input by the user to the list `L1`. Since `i` is initially 4, the input is for the 5th entry. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
