Postcondition: `L1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `L1`, and `j` is an integer. If `L1[i] % j == 0`, then `res` is a list with one additional element which is equal to `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `L1[i] % j != 0`, no changes are made to `res`.
