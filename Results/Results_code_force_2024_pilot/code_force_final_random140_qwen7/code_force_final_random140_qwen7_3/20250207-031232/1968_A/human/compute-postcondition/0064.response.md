Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list of integers with `num` elements, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list with `num` elements where each element is calculated as `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` if `L1[i] % j == 0` for some `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i]`, otherwise it is `None`, `i` is `num`, and `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `num` because the loop increments `i` from 0 up to `num-1`. During each iteration of the loop, for each `L1[i]`, the loop checks every integer `j` from 2 to `L1[i]` (inclusive). If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, it appends `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res` and breaks out of the loop. This process is repeated for each element in `L1` until `i` reaches `num`. Therefore, `res` will contain `num` elements, each calculated based on the divisibility condition described. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `L1`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
