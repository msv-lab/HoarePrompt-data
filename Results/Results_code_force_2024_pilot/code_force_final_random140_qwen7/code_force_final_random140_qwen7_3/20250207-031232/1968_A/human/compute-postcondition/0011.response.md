Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `num + 1`.
   - `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(num)` to execute, `i` must iterate over the range from `0` to `num-1`.
   - This means `i` should start from `0` and go up to `num-1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `num + 1`, it will not satisfy the condition `i in range(num)` unless it is adjusted to start from `0`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to start from `0`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `t`, `x`, and `res` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
   - `L1` and `num` are already correctly set according to the problem statement.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` starting from `0` instead of `num + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and all the elements in `L1` are the integers entered by the user during the loop's iterations.**
