Output State: The loop will continue to execute until it has iterated over the range defined by `range(2, L1[i] + 1)`. After all iterations, `res` will contain as many elements as there are integers in the range from 2 to `L1[i]` inclusive. For each iteration, if `L1[i] % j == 0`, the value `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` is appended to `res`; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged for that iteration. Since `L1[i]` is an integer and the loop runs from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`, the final state of `res` will be a list of integers calculated based on the divisibility condition for each `j` in the specified range.

In more detail, `res` will contain the results of the expression `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` for every `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i]` inclusive, provided that `L1[i] % j == 0`. If no such `j` exists, the corresponding position in `res` will be `None`. Therefore, the final `res` will be a list of integers and possibly `None` values, depending on the divisibility conditions met during the loop's execution.
