You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and all the elements in `L1` are the integers entered by the user during the loop's iterations.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each being an integer input by the user, and `i` will be set to `num + 1`. The variables `t`, `x`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list of integers with `num` elements, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list with `num` elements where each element is calculated as `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` if `L1[i] % j == 0` for some `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i]`, otherwise it is `None`, `i` is `num`, and `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: [element1, element2, ..., elementN] where each element is either a calculated integer or None, and N is the number of elements in the res list
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where 't' is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, 'x' is an integer within the range 2 to 1000. The function returns a value based on the conditions met by 't' and 'x'.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
