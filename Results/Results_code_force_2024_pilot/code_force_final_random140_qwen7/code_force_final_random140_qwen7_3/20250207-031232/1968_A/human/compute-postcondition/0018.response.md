Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing one additional element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `i` is 1, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[i]` is at least 1 and divisible by `j + 1`**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends a new element to the list `res`. This new element is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, where `i` is 1 and `j` is an unspecified integer that must divide `L1[1]` without a remainder and be such that `j + 1` divides `L1[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
