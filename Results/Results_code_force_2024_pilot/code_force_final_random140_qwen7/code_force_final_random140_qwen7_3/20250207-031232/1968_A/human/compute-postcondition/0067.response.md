Functionality: **The function reads a specified number of integer inputs from the user, stores them in a list `L1`, and then calculates a new value for each element in `L1` based on certain conditions. For each element in `L1`, it finds a divisor `j` such that `L1[i] % j == 0`, and if found, it appends the value `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. If no such divisor is found, the corresponding position in `res` remains `None`. Finally, it prints each element of `res` on a new line.**
