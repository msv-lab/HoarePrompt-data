Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing one additional element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `i` is 1, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[i]` is at least 1 and divisible by `j + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
