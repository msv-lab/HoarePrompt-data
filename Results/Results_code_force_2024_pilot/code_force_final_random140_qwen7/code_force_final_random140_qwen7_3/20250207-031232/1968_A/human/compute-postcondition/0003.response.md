State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer, `L1` is an empty list, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The loop condition `i < num` determines whether the loop continues. For the loop to execute at least once, `num` must be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`t`, `x`, `L1`, `res`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
