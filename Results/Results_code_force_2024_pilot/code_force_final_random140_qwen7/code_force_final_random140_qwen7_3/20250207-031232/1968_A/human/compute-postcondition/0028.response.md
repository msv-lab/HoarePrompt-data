Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing multiple elements, `i` is `num`, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and all the elements in `L1` are the integers entered by the user during the loop's iterations.

**Explanation:**
After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `num` because the loop increments `i` from 0 up to `num-1`. During each iteration of the loop, for each `L1[i]`, the loop checks every integer `j` from 2 to `L1[i]` (inclusive). If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, it appends `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res` and breaks out of the loop. This process is repeated for each element in `L1` until `i` reaches `num`. Therefore, `res` will contain multiple elements, one for each `L1[i]` that satisfied the condition `L1[i] % j == 0` for some `j` between 2 and `L1[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `L1`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
