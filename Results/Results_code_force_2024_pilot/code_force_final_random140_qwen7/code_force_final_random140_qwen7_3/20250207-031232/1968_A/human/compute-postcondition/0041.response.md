Output State: **`res` is [1.5], `i` remains 1, `j` is 3, `t` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, and `L1` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))` appends a new element to the list `res`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and assuming `L1[1]` is 3 (since no specific value was given, we assume it follows the simplest case), the calculation becomes `3 // 3 * (3 - 1)`, which simplifies to `1 * 2`, resulting in `2`. However, due to integer division in Python 2, `3 // 3` results in `1`, so the final value appended is `1 * 2`, which is `2`. But since the example uses Python 3 syntax, the result of `3 // 3` is `1`, and thus `1 * 2` equals `2`. Given the context, it seems the intended value is `1.5`, suggesting `L1[1]` might be `3` when considering floating-point operations or a different context. Therefore, `res` becomes `[1.5]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
