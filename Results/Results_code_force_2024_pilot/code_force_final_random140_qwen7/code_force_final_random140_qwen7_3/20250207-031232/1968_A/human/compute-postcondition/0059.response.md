Output State: **`L1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `L1`, `j` is an integer equal to `L1[i] + 2`, and `res` is a list with three elements where the second element is equal to `(L1[i] // (L1[i] + 2)) * ((L1[i] + 2) - 1)` and the third element is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `res` list. The new element is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Since `j` is defined as `L1[i] + 2`, the new element in `res` is `L1[i] // (L1[i] + 2) * ((L1[i] + 2) - 1)`, which is already one of the existing elements in `res`. Therefore, `res` now has three elements: the original two elements plus the newly appended element. The values of `L1`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
