Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < num`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\)
   - `num` is an input integer and must be greater than 0
   - `L1` is a list containing one element which is an integer entered by the user
   - `res` is an empty list
   - `i` is 1
   - `num` must be greater than 0 (this is already satisfied since `i` is 1)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `num`.

Given that `i` is currently 1 and `num` must be greater than 0 (which it is), the loop can execute again if `num` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains the same (a positive integer between 1 and 1000)
- `x` remains the same (an integer between 2 and 1000)
- `num` remains the same (an input integer greater than 0)
- `L1` remains the same (a list containing one element which is an integer entered by the user)
- `res` remains the same (an empty list)
- `i` is now 2
- `num` must be greater than 0 (still true)

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer, `L1` is a list containing one element which is an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `num` must be greater than 0**
