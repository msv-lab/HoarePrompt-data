Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
- `L1` is a list of integers with `num` elements, where each element is entered by the user.
- `res` is a list with `num` elements where each element is calculated as \((L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)\) if \(L1[i] \% j == 0\) for some `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i]`, otherwise it is `None`.
- `i` is set to `num`.
- `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.

The `print(*res, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the `res` list, separated by a newline.

Each element in `res` is calculated based on the corresponding element in `L1`. Since the exact values of `L1` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `res`. However, we know that each element in `res` is either a calculated integer or `None`.

Therefore, the output will be a series of lines, each containing an integer or `None`, depending on the values in `L1`.

Output: **[element1, element2, ..., elementN] where each element is either a calculated integer or None, and N is the number of elements in the res list**
