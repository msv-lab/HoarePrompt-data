Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` from 2 to `L1[i]` inclusive.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
   - `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user.
   - `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `L1[i]` is at least 1 and divisible by `j + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `[2, L1[i]]`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was one of the values in this range.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `j + 1`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `num` remains the same.
   - `L1` remains the same.
   - `res` remains the same unless the new `j` satisfies the condition `L1[i] % j == 0`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `i` is still 1.
- `num` is still the same.
- `L1` is still the same.
- `res` is still the same unless the new `j` satisfies the condition `L1[i] % j == 0`.

Since `j` will be incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `i` is 1, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[i]` is at least 1 and divisible by `j + 1`. `j` is `j + 1`.**
