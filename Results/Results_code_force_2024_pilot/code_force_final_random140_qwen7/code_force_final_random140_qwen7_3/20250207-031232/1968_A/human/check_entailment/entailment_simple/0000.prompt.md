Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and all the elements in `L1` are the integers entered by the user during the loop's iterations.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each being an integer input by the user, and `i` will be set to `num + 1`. The variables `t`, `x`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list of integers with `num` elements, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list with `num` elements where each element is calculated as `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` if `L1[i] % j == 0` for some `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i]`, otherwise it is `None`, `i` is `num`, and `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: [element1, element2, ..., elementN] where each element is either a calculated integer or None, and N is the number of elements in the res list
