You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
    print(*res, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a specified number of integer inputs from the user, stores them in a list `L1`, and then calculates a new value for each element in `L1` based on certain conditions. For each element in `L1`, it finds a divisor `j` such that `L1[i] % j == 0`, and if found, it appends the value `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. If no such divisor is found, the corresponding position in `res` remains `None`. Finally, it prints each element of `res` on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num` and a list of integers `L1`.
   - This part seems to be correctly handling the input as per the problem statement.

2. **Finding `y` for Each Test Case**:
   - The program iterates through each integer `x` in `L1`.
   - For each `x`, it tries to find a `y` such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - It does this by iterating from 2 to `x` and checking if `x % j == 0`. If true, it calculates `y` as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` and appends it to `res`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**:
   - The logic used to calculate `y` is flawed. Specifically, `y = L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - For example, consider \(x = 10\). The program might choose \(y = 5\) (since \(10 // 2 * (2 - 1) = 5\)), but the correct `y` should be 5 because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\), which is the maximum possible value.

2. **Maximizing \(\gcd(x, y) + y\)**:
   - To maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` itself. This is because the gcd of `x` and its largest proper divisor will be the largest possible gcd.
   - The correct approach would be to iterate from `x-1` down to 1 and check the gcd.

### Correct Approach:

1. Iterate from `x-1` down to 1.
2. Check the gcd of `x` with each value.
3. Return the first value where the gcd is non-zero, as this will be the largest possible gcd.

### Revised Program:

```python
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    res = []
    for _ in range(num):
        x = int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(_) + '- '))
        for y in range(x-1, 0, -1):
            if x % y == 0:
                res.append(y)
                break
    print(*res, sep='\n')
```

### Conclusion:

The original program does not correctly find the value of `y` that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
