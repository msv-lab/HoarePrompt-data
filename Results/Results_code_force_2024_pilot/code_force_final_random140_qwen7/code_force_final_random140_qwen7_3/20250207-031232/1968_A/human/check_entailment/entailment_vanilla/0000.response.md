Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num` and a list of integers `L1`.
   - This part seems to be correctly handling the input as per the problem statement.

2. **Finding `y` for Each Test Case**:
   - The program iterates through each integer `x` in `L1`.
   - For each `x`, it tries to find a `y` such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - It does this by iterating from 2 to `x` and checking if `x % j == 0`. If true, it calculates `y` as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` and appends it to `res`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**:
   - The logic used to calculate `y` is flawed. Specifically, `y = L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - For example, consider \(x = 10\). The program might choose \(y = 5\) (since \(10 // 2 * (2 - 1) = 5\)), but the correct `y` should be 5 because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\), which is the maximum possible value.

2. **Maximizing \(\gcd(x, y) + y\)**:
   - To maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` itself. This is because the gcd of `x` and its largest proper divisor will be the largest possible gcd.
   - The correct approach would be to iterate from `x-1` down to 1 and check the gcd.

### Correct Approach:

1. Iterate from `x-1` down to 1.
2. Check the gcd of `x` with each value.
3. Return the first value where the gcd is non-zero, as this will be the largest possible gcd.

### Revised Program:

```python
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    res = []
    for _ in range(num):
        x = int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(_) + '- '))
        for y in range(x-1, 0, -1):
            if x % y == 0:
                res.append(y)
                break
    print(*res, sep='\n')
```

### Conclusion:

The original program does not correctly find the value of `y` that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
