Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`) and then reads `num` integers for each test case into the list `L1`. This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Finding `y`**: The nested loop attempts to find a suitable `y` for each `x` in `L1`. However, the logic used to find `y` is flawed. Specifically, the inner loop iterates from 2 to `L1[i]` and checks if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`. If it is, it calculates `y` as `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` and appends it to `res`. 

   - The calculation of `y` does not necessarily maximize `\gcd(x, y) + y`.
   - The approach of finding `y` as `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` is not aligned with the problem requirements. Instead, we need to find a `y` such that `\gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.

3. **Output**: The program prints the results stored in `res`, but the values in `res` are not guaranteed to be correct according to the problem statement.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
