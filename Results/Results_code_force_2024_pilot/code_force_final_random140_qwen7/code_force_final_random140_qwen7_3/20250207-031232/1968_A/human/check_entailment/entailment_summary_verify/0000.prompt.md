You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

- Program:
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
    print(*res, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a specified number of integer inputs from the user, stores them in a list `L1`, and then calculates a new value for each element in `L1` based on certain conditions. For each element in `L1`, it finds a divisor `j` such that `L1[i] % j == 0`, and if found, it appends the value `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. If no such divisor is found, the corresponding position in `res` remains `None`. Finally, it prints each element of `res` on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. According to the problem description, the goal is to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. However, the program attempts to find a factor of \( x \) and then calculates \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \), which does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

For example, consider the input \( x = 10 \). The correct output should be \( y = 5 \) because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is the maximum possible value. However, the program might output something like \( y = 4 \) because it finds the smallest factor \( j = 2 \) and calculates \( \frac{10}{2} \times (2 - 1) = 5 \), but this is not the optimal solution.

Thus, the program does not always find the correct \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
