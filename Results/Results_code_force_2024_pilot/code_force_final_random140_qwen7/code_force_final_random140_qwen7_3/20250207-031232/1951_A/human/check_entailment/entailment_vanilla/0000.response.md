Reasoning:

1. The provided program `func()` is completely separate from the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, which is described in the problem statement.
2. The `func()` function reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` lines of input. Each line consists of a string `arr` containing only '0's and '1's.
3. The function counts the number of '1's in each string `arr` and determines whether to append 'yes' or 'no' to the `results` list based on specific conditions.
4. The problem statement does not mention any functionality related to `func()`, nor does it require the program to perform the operations defined in `func()`.
5. The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, however, is described in the problem statement and appears to be implemented correctly according to its specifications.

Since the `func()` function is unrelated to the problem described and does not affect the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, we can conclude that the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is correct based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
