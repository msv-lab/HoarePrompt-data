Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing 'yes', `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered as input, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`. The current value of `count_ones` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
