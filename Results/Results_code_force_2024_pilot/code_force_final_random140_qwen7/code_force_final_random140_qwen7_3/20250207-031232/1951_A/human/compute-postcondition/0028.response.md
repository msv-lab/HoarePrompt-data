Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing 'yes', `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered as input, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, and `count_ones` is not equal to 2**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` is an empty list. After executing `results.append('yes')`, `results` contains the single element `'yes'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
