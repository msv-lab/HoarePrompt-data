Output State: **`results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no'.**

Explanation: Since the loop runs for a fixed number of iterations (as indicated by the first three outputs), and `t` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, once all iterations are complete, `t` remains 0. This means no new elements can be appended to the `results` list after the loop finishes. Therefore, the final state of `results` will be whatever it was after the last iteration, which is described as a list containing 'yes' and 'no'.
