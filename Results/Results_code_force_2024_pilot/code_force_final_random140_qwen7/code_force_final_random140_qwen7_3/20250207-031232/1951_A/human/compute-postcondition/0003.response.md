Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial state.
