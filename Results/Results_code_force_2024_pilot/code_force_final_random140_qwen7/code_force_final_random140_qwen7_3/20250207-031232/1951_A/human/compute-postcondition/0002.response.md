State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t`, which is used as the range parameter in `range(t)`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). If `t` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute.
3. The other variables (`start`, `end`, and `results`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` must be greater than 0.
