Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `arr`. It checks the number of '1's in `arr` and appends 'yes' or 'no' to the `results` list based on specific conditions. Finally, it prints the contents of the `results` list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything.**
