Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is the integer input from the user, `arr` is the input string entered, `count_ones` is the count of '1's in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
