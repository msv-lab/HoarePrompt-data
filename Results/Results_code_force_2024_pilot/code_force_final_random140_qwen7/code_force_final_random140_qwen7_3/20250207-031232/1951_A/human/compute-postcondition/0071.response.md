Based on the initial state provided, `results` is a list with at least 2 elements remaining. However, the specific elements of the list are not mentioned. Since the print statement only references `r`, and there is no variable named `r` defined in the snippet, it's likely that `r` is meant to be an element from the `results` list. Given that the list has at least 2 elements, we can assume `r` refers to one of those elements.

Since the exact value of `r` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of its position in the list. For example, if `r` is the first element, it would be `results[0]`, and if it is the second element, it would be `results[1]`, and so on.

Given the lack of specific details about `r`, the most precise description we can provide is that `r` is one of the elements in the `results` list.

Output: **one of the elements in the `results` list**
