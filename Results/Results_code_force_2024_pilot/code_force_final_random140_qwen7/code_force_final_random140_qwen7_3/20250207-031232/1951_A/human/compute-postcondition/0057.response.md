Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing 'no', `n` is the integer input from the user, `arr` is the string input from the user, `count_ones` is the count of '1's in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
