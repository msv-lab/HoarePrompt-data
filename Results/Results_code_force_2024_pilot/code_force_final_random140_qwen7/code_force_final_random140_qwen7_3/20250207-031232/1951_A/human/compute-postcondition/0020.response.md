Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing 'no', `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered as input, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, and `count_ones` is equal to 2. The string `'11'` is present in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `results.append('no')` appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
