Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered as input, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code counts the number of '1's in the list `arr` and assigns this count to the variable `count_ones`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
