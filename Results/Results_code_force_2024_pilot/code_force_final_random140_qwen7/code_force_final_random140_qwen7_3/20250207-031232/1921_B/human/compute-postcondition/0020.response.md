Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is equal to the count of indices `i` where `s[i] > t[i]` holds true over the entire range of `n`, `b` is equal to the count of indices `i` where `s[i] < t[i]` holds true over the entire range of `n`, and `i` is equal to `n-1`; `t` is a newly input string.**

Explanation: The code `t = input()` takes a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new string input is stored in `t`.
