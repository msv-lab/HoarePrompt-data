Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is 1 if `s[0] < t[0]` is True, else `b` is 0, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding 1 if `s[i] < t[i]` is True. Since `i` is 0, the condition checks `s[0] < t[0]`. If this condition is true, `b` becomes 1; otherwise, `b` remains 0. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
