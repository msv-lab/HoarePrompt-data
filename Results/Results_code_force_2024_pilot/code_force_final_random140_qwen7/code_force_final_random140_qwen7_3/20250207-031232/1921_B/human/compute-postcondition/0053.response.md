Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n`, a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and another string `t` of the same length. For each test case, it counts the number of positions where the characters in `s` are greater than and less than the corresponding characters in `t`. It then prints the maximum of these two counts, which represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into a state where each character matches the corresponding character in `t`.**
