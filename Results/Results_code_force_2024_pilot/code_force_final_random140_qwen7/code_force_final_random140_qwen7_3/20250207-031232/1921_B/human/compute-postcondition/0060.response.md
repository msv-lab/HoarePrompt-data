Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the condition `i < n` is false, and the loop will not execute again.
   - Therefore, there is no need to change the value of `i` or `n` for the loop to execute one more time because it won't execute at all.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - No changes are needed for `i` and `n` since the loop won't run again.
   - The postcondition about `hd` being incremented if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` does not apply since the loop won't run.

Given this analysis, the states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` is incremented by 1.**
