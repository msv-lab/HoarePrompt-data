Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is 1 if `s[0] < t[0]` is True, else `b` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `a += s[i] > t[i]` checks if the element at index `i` in list `s` is greater than the element at the same index in list `t`. Since `i` starts at 1, it compares `s[1]` with `t[1]`. The value of `a` is incremented by 1 if the condition is true, otherwise it remains unchanged. Given the initial state, `b` is 1 if `s[0] < t[0]` is True, else `b` is 0. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
