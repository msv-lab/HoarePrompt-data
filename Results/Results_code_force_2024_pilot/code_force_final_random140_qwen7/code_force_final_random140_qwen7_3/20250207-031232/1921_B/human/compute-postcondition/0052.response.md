Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and two strings `s` and `f` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It processes each test case and returns information about the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into the desired state `f`.**

Note: The actual processing logic and operations to transform `s` into `f` are not described here, only the parameters and expected behavior.
