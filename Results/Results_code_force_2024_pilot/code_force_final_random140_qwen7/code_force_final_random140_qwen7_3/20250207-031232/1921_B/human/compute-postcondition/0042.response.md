Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is the original value of `a` plus 1 if `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`, otherwise it remains the same.
   - `b` is `b` plus 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `n`, we need to increment `i` by 1.
   - The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes them, but since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, we assume they stay the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given that `i` was previously set such that the loop could continue, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is the original value of `a` plus 1 if `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`, otherwise it remains the same; `b` is `b` plus 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
