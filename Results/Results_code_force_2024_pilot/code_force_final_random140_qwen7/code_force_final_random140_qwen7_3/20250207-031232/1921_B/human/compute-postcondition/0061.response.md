Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `hd` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `hd += 1` increments the value of `hd` by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the condition for `hd` (that it is incremented if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`) is still valid. Therefore, the updated state includes that `hd` has been incremented by 1.
