Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `t` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code `a = b = 0` assigns the value 0 to both `a` and `b`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the assignment does not affect it. The value of `t` remains as an input string since no operation was performed on it.
