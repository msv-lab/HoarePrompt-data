Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0; `hd` is `hd` + 1**

Explanation: The variable `hd` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `n`, `n` must still be greater than 0, and `hd` is now one more than its original value.
