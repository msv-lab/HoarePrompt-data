Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the parameter `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n - 1`.
   - `n` is a parameter that is not explicitly given its value in the problem statement.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. This is because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to `n - 1`, the loop will start with `i` being `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

5. **Final state after adjustment**:
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `t` is an input string.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

**State:**
**`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
