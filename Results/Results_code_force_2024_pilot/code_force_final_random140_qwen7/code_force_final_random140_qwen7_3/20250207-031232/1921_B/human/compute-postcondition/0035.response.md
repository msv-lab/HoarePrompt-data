Output State: **`a` is the sum of all `s[i] > t[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `b` is `n + 3`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` remains the sum of all `s[i] > t[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `b` remains `n + 3`, and `i` remains `n - 1`. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user.
