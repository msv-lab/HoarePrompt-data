Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n)` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the changes made in the loop body**:
   - `a` is updated based on the condition `s[i] > t[i]`.
   - `b` is updated based on the condition `s[i] < t[i]`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
   - `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] < t[i]`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is the original value of `a` plus 1 if `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`, otherwise it remains the same.
- `b` is `b` plus 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `b` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `b` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is the original value of `a` plus 1 if `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`, otherwise it remains the same; `b` is `b` plus 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` must be the same as before.**
