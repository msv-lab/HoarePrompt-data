Output State: **`a` is `s[i] > t[i]`, `b` is 0, `i` is `n-2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` by adding 1 if the condition `s[i] > t[i]` is true. Since `i` was initially set to `n-1`, after executing `a += s[i] > t[i]`, `i` is decremented by 1, making it `n-2`. The value of `b` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `a` now depends on whether `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` at the current index `i`.
