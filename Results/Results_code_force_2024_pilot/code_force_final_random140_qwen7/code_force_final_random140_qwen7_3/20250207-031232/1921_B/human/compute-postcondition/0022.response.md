Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is an unknown value at this point.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to `n-1`, and the loop will start with `i` being decremented from `n-1` to 0, `i` will be within the valid range if `n` is at least 1.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Final state after adjustment**:
   - `a` is 0 (unchanged).
   - `b` is 0 (unchanged).
   - `i` is `n-1` (unchanged).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`a` is 0, `b` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
