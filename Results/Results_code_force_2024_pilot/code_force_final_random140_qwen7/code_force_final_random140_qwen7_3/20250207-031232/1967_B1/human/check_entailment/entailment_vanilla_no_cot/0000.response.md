Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, it calculates the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided code does not account for this condition. Instead, it simply counts the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\), which is incorrect.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the given condition. If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count. This ensures that the solution is correct according to the problem statement.
