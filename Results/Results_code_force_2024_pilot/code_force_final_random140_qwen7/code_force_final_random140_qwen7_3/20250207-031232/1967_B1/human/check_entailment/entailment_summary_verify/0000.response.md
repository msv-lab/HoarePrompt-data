### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + n // b + 1
        print(ans)
```

#### Function Summary:
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of \( n // b + 1 \) for each \( b \) in the range from 1 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \). After processing all test cases, it prints the result for each test case.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** False.
- **Explanation:** The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program calculates `ans` using the formula `ans = ans + n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. This approach does not account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check:**
   - The program does not check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for any pair `(a, b)`.
   - Instead, it simply adds `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`.

2. **Example Test Case:**
   - Consider the test case `(n, m) = (10, 8)`:
     - The program calculates `ans` as follows:
       - For `b = 1`: `ans += 10 // 1 + 1 = 11`
       - For `b = 2`: `ans += 10 // 2 + 1 = 6`
       - For `b = 3`: `ans += 10 // 3 + 1 = 4`
       - For `b = 4`: `ans += 10 // 4 + 1 = 3`
       - For `b = 5`: `ans += 10 // 5 + 1 = 3`
       - For `b = 6`: `ans += 10 // 6 + 1 = 2`
       - For `b = 7`: `ans += 10 // 7 + 1 = 2`
       - For `b = 8`: `ans += 10 // 8 + 1 = 2`
     - Total `ans = 11 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 33`

3. **Correct Solution:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The program does not perform this check, which is why it produces incorrect results.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
