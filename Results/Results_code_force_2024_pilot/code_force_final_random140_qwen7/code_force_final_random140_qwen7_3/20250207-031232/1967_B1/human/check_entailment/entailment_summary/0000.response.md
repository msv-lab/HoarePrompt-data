Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It then iterates over \(b\) from 1 to the minimum of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(n // b + 1\) and adds this value to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans` for each test case.
3. **Key Observation**:
   - The program does not actually check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it simply counts the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\).
   - This approach does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
