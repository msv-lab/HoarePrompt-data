Output State: `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)` inclusive, `n` is an integer from the first element of the input list, `m` is an integer from the second element of the input list.

In simpler terms, `ans` will be the sum of `n // b + 1` for every integer `b` from 1 up to the smaller of `n` or `m`.
