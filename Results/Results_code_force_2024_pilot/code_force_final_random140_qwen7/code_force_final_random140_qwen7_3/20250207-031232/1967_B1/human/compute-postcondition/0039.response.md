Based on the initial state provided, the variable `ans` is calculated as the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)` inclusive. Initially, `ans` is set to 0.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. For each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)`:
   - Compute `n // b + 1`
   - Add this value to `ans`

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can express the final value of `ans` in terms of these variables.

The final value of `ans` will be the sum of `n // b + 1` for every integer `b` from 1 up to the smaller of `n` and `m`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n // b + 1 for every integer b from 1 up to min(n, m))**
