Output State: **`ans` is `n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1 + n // b + 1`, `n` is an integer from the first element of the input list, `m` is an integer from the second element of the input list, `b` is an integer from the third element of the input list.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially set to `n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1`. After executing the line `ans = ans + n // b + 1`, `ans` is updated to include `n // b + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
