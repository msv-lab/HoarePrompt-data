Output State: **`ans` is `ans + n // (b + 1) + 1 + n // b + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `b` is `b + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially updated to `ans + n // (b + 1) + 1`. Now, the code updates `ans` again to `ans + n // b + 1`. Since `b` is `b + 1` from the initial state, the new value of `b` is used in the second update. Therefore, the final value of `ans` is the sum of its initial value plus `n // (b + 1) + 1` and `n // b + 1`. The values of `n` and `b` are updated as per the initial state description.
