Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `T` and it iterates over the range from `0` to `t-1`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that each iteration of the loop updates the variable `ans` by adding `n // b + 1` for the current value of `b`, where `b` starts from `1` and goes up to `min(n, m)`. The variable `T` is set to the value of `int(input())` and must be within the range from `0` to `t-1`. The list `[n, m]` retains its initial values, and `b` is updated to be `min(n, m)` at the end of the loop.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `ans`: This is the cumulative sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` from `1` to `min(n, m)`.
   - `T`: This is the value of `int(input())` and must be in the range from `0` to `t-1`.
   - `[n, m]`: This list retains its initial values.
   - `b`: At the end of the loop, `b` is set to `min(n, m)`.

Given that the loop is about to execute another iteration, `T` will be incremented by `1` (since `T` starts from `0` and goes up to `t-1`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `T` will be `1`.

Since `b` is set to `min(n, m)` at the end of each iteration, `b` will also be `min(n, m)` at the start of the next iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `T` is incremented by `1`.
- `[n, m]` retains its initial values.
- `b` is `min(n, m)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)`, `T` is the value of `int(input())` and must be in the range from 1 to `t-1`, `[n, m]` is a list containing two integers such that `min(n, m)` is equal to `min(n, m)`, `b` is `min(n, m)`**.
