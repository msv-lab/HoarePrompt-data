The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It computes and prints a result based on the bitwise XOR operations performed on the list of integers. Specifically, it calculates the sum of certain combinations of bit counts related to the bitwise XOR values of the input list. The function does not return any value but prints the computed result.
