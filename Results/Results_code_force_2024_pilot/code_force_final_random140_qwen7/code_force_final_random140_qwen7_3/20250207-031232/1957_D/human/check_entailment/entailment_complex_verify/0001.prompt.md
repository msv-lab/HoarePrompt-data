You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (with at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop), `prefix` is a list containing `len(arr) + 1` integers where each element (except the first one) is the cumulative bitwise XOR of all previous elements in `arr`, `v` is the current element being processed in `arr`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `arr` contains the original list of integers, and `prefix` is a list of length equal to the number of elements in `arr` plus one. Each element in `prefix` (starting from the second one) is the result of performing a bitwise XOR operation on all the elements in `arr` up to that point in the sequence.

    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be reduced to 1 (since it starts at 31 and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1). The variable `j` will reach 32 because the loop iterates over the range from 31 down to 1, and `j` is incremented within the inner loop. The variable `cur` will be the value of `prefix[1]` since `i` starts at 31 and decreases to 1. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will contain the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `j` is 31, `c` is an integer where the highest bit (31st bit) is 1, `pre[31][0]` is 0, `pre[31][1]` is 32, `suf[31][0]` is -32, and `suf[31][1]` is -32.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, `c` will have its highest bit set to 1, indicating it is a non-zero integer. The counts in `pre[31]` reflect that there are no zeros (since `pre[31][0]` is 0) and 32 ones across all bits up to the 31st bit. Similarly, `suf[31]` indicates that there are no additional zeros beyond the 31st bit (hence `-32` for `suf[31][0]`) and 32 ones (hence `-32` for `suf[31][1]`).
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is derived from the provided pre and suf arrays, specifically the counts of zeros and ones up to and beyond the 31st bit)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It computes and prints a result based on the bitwise XOR operations performed on the list of integers. Specifically, it calculates the sum of certain combinations of bit counts related to the bitwise XOR values of the input list. The function does not return any value but prints the computed result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR values and stores them in the `prefix` list.
   - This part is correct and necessary for calculating the required XOR operations.

3. **Initialization of Pre and Suffix Arrays:**
   - The `pre` and `suf` arrays are initialized to store counts of zeros and ones for each bit position (0 to 31).
   - The initialization of `pre` is correct, setting all counts of zeros to 1.
   - The initialization of `suf` is also correct, setting initial counts of zeros and ones based on the last element of the prefix XOR array.

4. **Counting Zeros and Ones for Each Bit Position:**
   - The program iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, updating the suffix counts (`suf`) and prefix counts (`pre`).
   - This is done correctly, ensuring that the counts are updated as we move through the array.

5. **Calculating the Answer:**
   - The program iterates through each possible tuple `(x, y, z)` and uses the precomputed counts to determine if the condition `f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)` holds.
   - The logic for counting valid tuples is correct, using the pre and suffix arrays to efficiently count the number of valid tuples.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is correct.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem statement and the example provided. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` that satisfy the given conditions.
