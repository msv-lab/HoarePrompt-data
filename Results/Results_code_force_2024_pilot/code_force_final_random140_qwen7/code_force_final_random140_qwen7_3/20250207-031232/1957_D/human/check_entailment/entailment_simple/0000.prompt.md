Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

# Annotated Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (with at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop), `prefix` is a list containing `len(arr) + 1` integers where each element (except the first one) is the cumulative bitwise XOR of all previous elements in `arr`, `v` is the current element being processed in `arr`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `arr` contains the original list of integers, and `prefix` is a list of length equal to the number of elements in `arr` plus one. Each element in `prefix` (starting from the second one) is the result of performing a bitwise XOR operation on all the elements in `arr` up to that point in the sequence.
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: `i` is 31; `pre[0][0]` is 32; `pre[2][0]` is 32; `pre[30][0]` is 32; `pre[31][0]` is 33.
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 1, `j` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[1]`, and for every `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` represents the count of bits set to 0 and `suf[j][1]` represents the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be reduced to 1 (since it starts at 31 and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1). The variable `j` will reach 32 because the loop iterates over the range from 31 down to 1, and `j` is incremented within the inner loop. The variable `cur` will be the value of `prefix[1]` since `i` starts at 31 and decreases to 1. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will contain the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        
        c = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `j` is 31, `c` is an integer where the highest bit (31st bit) is 1, `pre[31][0]` is 0, `pre[31][1]` is 32, `suf[31][0]` is -32, and `suf[31][1]` is -32.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, `c` will have its highest bit set to 1, indicating it is a non-zero integer. The counts in `pre[31]` reflect that there are no zeros (since `pre[31][0]` is 0) and 32 ones across all bits up to the 31st bit. Similarly, `suf[31]` indicates that there are no additional zeros beyond the 31st bit (hence `-32` for `suf[31][0]`) and 32 ones (hence `-32` for `suf[31][1]`).
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is derived from the provided pre and suf arrays, specifically the counts of zeros and ones up to and beyond the 31st bit)
