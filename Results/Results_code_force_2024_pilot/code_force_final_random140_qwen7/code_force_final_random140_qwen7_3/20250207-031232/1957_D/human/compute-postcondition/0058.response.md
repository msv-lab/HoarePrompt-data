Output State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 3, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `suf[j][0]` is 1**

The code increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, `suf[j][0]` which was initially unspecified (but considering no prior value is mentioned, we assume it was 0) is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
