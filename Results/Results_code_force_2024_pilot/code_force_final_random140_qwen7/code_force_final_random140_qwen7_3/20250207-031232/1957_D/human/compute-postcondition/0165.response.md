Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `c`.
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 32.
3. **Initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `c` is an integer
   - `pre[0][0]` is 0
   - `suf[0][0]` is -1
   - The postcondition involves checking if `c` shifted right by `j` bits and performing bitwise AND with 1 results in a non-zero value.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and the loop iterates up to 31 (inclusive), the next value of `j` will be 2.
   - The value of `c` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operation modifies `c`.
   - The values of `pre[0][0]` and `suf[0][0]` remain unchanged as well since they are not involved in the loop condition or body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][0]` is 0, `suf[0][0]` is -1**
