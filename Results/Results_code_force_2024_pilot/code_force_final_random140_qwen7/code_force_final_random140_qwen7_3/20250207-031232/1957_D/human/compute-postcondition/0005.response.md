Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v` (the variable iterating over `arr`) and `arr`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `arr` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element.
   - `prefix` is a list containing two integers where the second integer is the bitwise XOR of the first integer and the first element of `arr`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `arr`, the first element of `arr` is processed in each iteration.
   - After processing each element, the next element in `arr` should be considered.
   - Therefore, `arr` will lose its first element, and `v` will take the value of this first element.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `arr` will now be the list without its first element.
   - `v` will be the first element of the original `arr`.

6. **Maintain other states**: The values of `t`, `n`, and `prefix` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer that must have at least two elements, `prefix` is a list containing two integers where the second integer is the bitwise XOR of the first integer and the first element of the new `arr`, `v` is the first element of the new `arr`**.
