Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[1]`, and for every `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` represents the count of bits set to 0 and `suf[j][1]` represents the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`. `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to 0. No changes are made to `i`, `j`, `cur`, or the `suf` array during this line of code. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
