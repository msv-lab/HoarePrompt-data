Output State: **`j` is 0; `pre[0][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0 and the initial value of `(c >> j & 1)` is 0, it implies that `pre[0][0]` was initially 0. After executing the code, `pre[0][0]` becomes 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged.
