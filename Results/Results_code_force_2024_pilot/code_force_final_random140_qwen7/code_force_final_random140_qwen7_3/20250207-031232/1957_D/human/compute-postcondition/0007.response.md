Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v` and `arr`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `arr`.
3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer that must have at least two elements, `prefix` is a list containing three integers where the third integer is the bitwise XOR of the second integer and the first element of the new `arr`, and `v` is the first element of the new `arr`.

Since the loop is iterating over `arr` and `v` is being set to the next element of `arr` in each iteration, the next value of `v` will be the second element of `arr` (if `arr` still has elements).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `arr` will now contain all elements except the first one since `v` was just the first element.
   - `prefix` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `v` will be the second element of the original `arr`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, but now it has at least one element less than before.
- `prefix` is a list containing three integers where the third integer is the bitwise XOR of the second integer and the first element of the new `arr`.
- `v` is the second element of the new `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element, `prefix` is a list containing three integers where the third integer is the bitwise XOR of the second integer and the first element of the new `arr`, `v` is the second element of the new `arr`**.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element, `prefix` is a list containing three integers where the third integer is the bitwise XOR of the second integer and the first element of the new `arr`, `v` is the second element of the new `arr`**
