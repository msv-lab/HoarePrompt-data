Output State: **`i` is 31; `pre[0][0]` is 32; `pre[2][0]` is 32; `pre[30][0]` is 32; `pre[31][0]` is 33.**

In this scenario, the loop iterates 32 times because it runs from `i` starting at 0 up to but not including 32. Given that the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration and updates `pre[i][0]` by adding 1, after 32 iterations, `i` will be 31. The value of `pre[0][0]` will be incremented 32 times, making it 32. For each `i` from 2 to 31, `pre[i][0]` will also be incremented 32 times, so each of these will be 32. Additionally, `pre[31][0]` will be incremented one more time than the others, making it 33.
