Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `j` is an integer + 1, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1, `suf[j][1]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. The other variables (`cur`, `j`, and `suf[j][1]`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1, while `suf[j][1]` remains unchanged.
