Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is 1, `suf[0][1]` is unchanged, `pre[0][0]` is 0, `suf[0][0]` is -1.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, `pre[0][1]` (since `j` starts from 0) is incremented by 1, making it 1. The other variables (`c`, `suf[0][1]`, `pre[0][0]`, and `suf[0][0]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
