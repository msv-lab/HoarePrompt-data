Output State: **`j` is 0; `c` is an integer where the 0-th bit is now 1; `pre[j][0]` is 1; `suf[j][0]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Initially, `pre[j][0]` is 1. Since `j` is 0 and the 0-th bit of `c` is 1, these values remain unchanged. After executing the code, `suf[j][0]` becomes 0.
