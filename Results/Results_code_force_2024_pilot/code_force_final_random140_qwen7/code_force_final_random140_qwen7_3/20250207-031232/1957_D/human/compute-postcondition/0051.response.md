Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `cur`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to 31 (inclusive), meaning `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches 31.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 30
   - `j` is 0
   - `cur` is `prefix[30]`
   - `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` represent the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.
     - Since `j` is 0, `suf[0][0]` and `suf[0][1]` represent the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the least significant bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.

4. **Next iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1.
   - `cur` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will now represent the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the 1st bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 30.
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `cur` remains `prefix[30]`.
   - `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `suf[1][0]` and `suf[1][1]` represent the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the 1st bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.**
