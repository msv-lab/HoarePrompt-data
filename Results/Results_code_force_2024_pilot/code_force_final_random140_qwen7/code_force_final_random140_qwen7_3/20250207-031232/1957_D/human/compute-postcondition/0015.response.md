Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(32)`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `pre[0][0]` is 1

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 32.

4. **Calculate the new state**: Since the loop is iterating over a range from 0 to 31 (inclusive), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. The value of `pre[0][0]` does not change within the loop head and is not part of the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `pre[0][0]` is 1**
