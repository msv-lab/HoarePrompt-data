Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(32)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 32. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than 32.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will now be 2.

6. **Consider other variables**: The variable `pre[0][0]` is not part of the loop head and its value does not change based on the loop iteration. Therefore, it remains unchanged.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `pre[0][0]` is 2**
