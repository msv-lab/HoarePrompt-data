Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for v in arr:`. The objects involved here are `v` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `v` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `arr` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `arr` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `v` is the variable that changes in each iteration, we don't need to specify its initial value directly. Instead, we need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element for the loop to start.
   - The initial state of `arr` should be such that it has at least one element.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the state that needs adjustment is the state of `arr` to ensure it has at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element, `prefix` is a list containing a single integer 0**
