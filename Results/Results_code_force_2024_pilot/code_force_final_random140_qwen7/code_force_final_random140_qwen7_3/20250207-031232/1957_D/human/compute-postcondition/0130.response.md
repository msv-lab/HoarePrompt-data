Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer where the 0-th bit is 1, `pre[1][0]` is 1, `pre[1][1]` is 1, and `suf[1][0]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Given the initial state where `j` is 1, `pre[1][1]` was initially 0 (since no other value is specified), so after executing the code, `pre[1][1]` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
