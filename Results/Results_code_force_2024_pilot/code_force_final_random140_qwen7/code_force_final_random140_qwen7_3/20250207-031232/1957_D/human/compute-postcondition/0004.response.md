Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element, `prefix` is a list containing two integers where the second integer is the bitwise XOR of the first integer and the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])` appends to the `prefix` list the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` (which is the last element of `arr`) and the last element of the `prefix` list. Since `prefix` initially contains only `[0]`, the second element of `prefix` will be `0 ^ v`, which is simply `v`. Therefore, `prefix` will contain `[0, v]` after the operation.
