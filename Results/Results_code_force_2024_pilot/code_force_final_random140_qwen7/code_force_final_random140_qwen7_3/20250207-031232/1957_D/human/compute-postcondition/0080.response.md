Postcondition: `cur` is an integer, `j` is 32, and `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` are updated based on the value of `(cur >> j & 1)`. If `(cur >> j & 1)` is true, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` remains unchanged. If `(cur >> j & 1)` is false, then `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` remains unchanged.
