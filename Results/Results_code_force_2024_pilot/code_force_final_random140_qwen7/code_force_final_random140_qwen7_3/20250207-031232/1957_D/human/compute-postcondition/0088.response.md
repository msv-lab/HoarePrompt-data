Output State: **`i` is 1; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates the bit length of the variable `y` using the `.bit_length()` method and then subtracts 1 from it. The value of `y` is taken from `arr[0]`, so `k` is the bit length of `arr[0]` minus 1. The values of `i` and `y` remain unchanged.
