Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[1][1]` is increased by 1, `suf[0][1]` is unchanged, `suf[1][1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, this means `suf[1][1]` is decreased by 1. The other variables (`j`, `c`, `pre[1][1]`, and `suf[0][1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
