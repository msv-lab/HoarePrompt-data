Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `j` is 0
   - `c` is an integer
   - `suf[0][1]` is decremented by 1 if the 0-th bit of `c` is 0, otherwise `j` is 0 (which it already is)
   - `c` is an integer where the 0-th bit is now 1
   - `pre[j][0]` is 1
   - `suf[j][0]` is 0

3. **Determine the changes for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (0) to 1.
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1, the new value of `j` will be 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `c` remains an integer.
   - `suf[0][1]` was decremented if the 0-th bit of `c` was 0, but since the 0-th bit of `c` is now 1, this condition does not apply, and `suf[0][1]` remains unchanged.
   - `c` remains an integer where the 0-th bit is now 1.
   - `pre[j][0]` will be updated to 1 because `j` is now 1.
   - `suf[j][0]` will be updated to 0 because `j` is now 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer where the 0-th bit is 1, `pre[1][0]` is 1, and `suf[1][0]` is 0**.
