Postcondition: `i` is 30, `j` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`, and the most significant bit of `cur` at position `j` is 1.
