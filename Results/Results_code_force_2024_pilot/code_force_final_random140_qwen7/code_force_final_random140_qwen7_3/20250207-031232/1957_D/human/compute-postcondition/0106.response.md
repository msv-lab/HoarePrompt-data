Postcondition: `j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[1][0]` is either 1 or 2, `suf[0][1]` is either unchanged or decremented by 1, and `suf[1][1]` is either unchanged or decreased by 1. If `c >> 1 & 1` is non-zero, then `pre[1][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[1][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `pre[1][0]` is 2 and `suf[1][1]` is -1.
