Postcondition: `j` is 2, `c` is an integer, `pre[1][0]` is 2, `suf[0][1]` is either unchanged or decremented by 1, and `suf[1][1]` is either unchanged or decreased by 1. If `c` shifted right by `j` bits and masked with 1 results in 1, then `suf[1][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `suf[1][0]` is decremented by 1.
