Output State: **j is 31, c is an integer, pre[0][0] is 0, suf[0][0] is -31, pre[31][1] is 32, and suf[31][1] is -32.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all 32 iterations, the variable `j` will be 31 since the loop runs from 0 to 31. The variable `c` remains as an integer because it is not modified within the loop. For each bit position `j`, if the corresponding bit in `c` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is incremented and `suf[j][1]` is decremented. Conversely, if the bit is 0, `pre[j][0]` is incremented and `suf[j][0]` is decremented. Since the loop runs for all 32 bits, `suf[0][1]` will be decremented 32 times, resulting in `-31`. Similarly, `pre[31][1]` will be incremented 32 times, resulting in `32`. The value of `suf[31][1]` remains `-32` as it was initially and no changes were made to it within the loop.
