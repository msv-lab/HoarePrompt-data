Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `31`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 31
   - `j` is 32 (This is the current value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration)

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**:
   - Since the loop starts from `0` and increments `j` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `33`.

4. **Check the postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - The postcondition states that if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is set to 1.
   - However, since `j` is currently 32 and the loop will increment it to 33, we need to consider the value of the bit at position `33` in `cur`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `j`.
   - Therefore, we need to update the value of `j` to `33`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 31, `j` is 33**
