Output State: **`j` is 31, `c` is an integer where the 0-th bit is 1, `pre[j][0]` is 1 or 2 for all `j` from 0 to 31, and `suf[j][1]` is 0 for all `j` from 0 to 30, and `suf[31][1]` is -32, `i` is 3, `y` is `arr[2]`**.

Explanation: The code `y = arr[i - 1]` assigns the value of `arr[i - 1]` to `y`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `i - 1` equals 1, so `y` is assigned the value of `arr[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
