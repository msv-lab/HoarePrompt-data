Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `31`, inclusive.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `32`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that:
   - `cur` is an integer.
   - `j` is an integer.
   - `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1 if `(cur >> j & 1)` is false.
   - `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1 if `(cur >> j & 1)` is true.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 at each iteration, the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `j + 1`.
   - The value of `cur` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - The array `suf` is updated based on the condition `(cur >> j & 1)`, but since the loop is about to increment `j`, the condition for the current `j` has already been checked and applied.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `cur` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The conditions for updating `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will be evaluated for the new `j` value in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cur` is an integer, `j` is an integer + 1, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1 if `(cur >> j & 1)` is false, and `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1 if `(cur >> j & 1)` is true**.
