Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[1][1]` is increased by 1, `suf[0][1]` is decremented by 1 if shifting `c` right by `j` bits and performing bitwise AND with 1 results in a non-zero value; otherwise, `pre[1][0]` is 1 and `suf[1][0]` is 0.**

This means that the value of `j` remains 1, `c` remains an integer, and `pre[1][1]` is incremented by 1. The state of `suf[0][1]` depends on the condition specified, and `pre[1][0]` and `suf[1][0]` are set accordingly based on the condition.
