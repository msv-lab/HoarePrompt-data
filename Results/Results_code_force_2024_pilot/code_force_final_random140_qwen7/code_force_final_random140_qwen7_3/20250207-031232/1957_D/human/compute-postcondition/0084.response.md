Output State: `i` is 1, `j` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[1]`, and for every `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` represents the count of bits set to 0 and `suf[j][1]` represents the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.

After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be reduced to 1 (since it starts at 31 and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1). The variable `j` will reach 32 because the loop iterates over the range from 31 down to 1, and `j` is incremented within the inner loop. The variable `cur` will be the value of `prefix[1]` since `i` starts at 31 and decreases to 1. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will contain the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.
