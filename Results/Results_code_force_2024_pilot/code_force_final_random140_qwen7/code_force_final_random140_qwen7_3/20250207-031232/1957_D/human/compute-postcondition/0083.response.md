Output State: `i` is 1, `j` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[1]`, and for every `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` represents the count of bits set to 0 and `suf[j][1]` represents the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.

After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be reduced to 1 (since it starts at 31 and decreases by 1 each iteration). The variable `j` will reach 32 because the loop runs until `i` becomes 0, and `j` increments up to 32 during its inner loop. `cur` will be updated to `prefix[1]` after the loop completes since the loop iterates over `i` from 31 down to 1. For each bit position from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will contain the counts of 0s and 1s, respectively, from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.
