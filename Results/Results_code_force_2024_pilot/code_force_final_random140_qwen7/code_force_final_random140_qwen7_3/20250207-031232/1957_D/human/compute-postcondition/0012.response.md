Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (with at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop), `prefix` is a list containing `len(arr) + 1` integers where each element (except the first one) is the cumulative bitwise XOR of all previous elements in `arr`, `v` is the current element being processed in `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two zeros, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `suf` as a list of 32 lists, each containing two zeros. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `v`, and `pre` remain unchanged.
