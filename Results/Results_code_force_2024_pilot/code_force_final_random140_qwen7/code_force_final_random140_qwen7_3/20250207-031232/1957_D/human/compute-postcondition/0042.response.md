Output State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 64, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `prefix[i]` to `cur`. Since `i` is 30, `cur` becomes `prefix[30]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and the array `suf` remain unchanged.
