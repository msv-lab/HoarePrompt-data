Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `31`, inclusive.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is 31.
   - `j` is less than 32 (so `j` is 31).

3. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < 32`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - Since `j` must be less than 32 for the loop to continue, and `j` was 31 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` should be 32 to satisfy the condition `j < 32`.
   - All other variables (`i` and `cur`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `i` remains 31.
   - `j` becomes 32 (since it needs to be less than 32 for the next iteration).
   - No changes are needed for `cur` or `suf` since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 31, `j` is 32**
