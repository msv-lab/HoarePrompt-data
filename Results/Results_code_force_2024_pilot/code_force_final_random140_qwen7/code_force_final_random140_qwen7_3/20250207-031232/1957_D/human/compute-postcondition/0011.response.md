Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (with at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop), `prefix` is a list containing `len(arr) + 1` integers where each element (except the first one) is the cumulative bitwise XOR of all previous elements in `arr`, `v` is the current element being processed in `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `pre` with 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, or `v`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The list `pre` is updated to contain 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`.
