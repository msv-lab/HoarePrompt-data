Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (with at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop), `prefix` is a list containing `len(arr) + 1` integers where each element (except the first one) is the cumulative bitwise XOR of all previous elements in `arr`, `v` is the current element being processed in `arr`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `arr` contains the original list of integers, and `prefix` is a list of length equal to the number of elements in `arr` plus one. Each element in `prefix` (starting from the second one) is the result of performing a bitwise XOR operation on all the elements in `arr` up to that point in the sequence.
