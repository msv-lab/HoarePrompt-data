Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `j`, which ranges from 0 to 31.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 30.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `cur` is `prefix[30]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 31. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Calculate the new value of `j`**: Since `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 3 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjust other relevant states**: The other states (`i` and `cur`) do not change within the loop head. They are only updated or used inside the loop body, but their values at the start of the next iteration remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` remains 30.
   - `j` is now 3.
   - `cur` remains `prefix[30]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 3, `cur` is `prefix[30]`**
