Output State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 3, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `suf[3][1]` is incremented by 1.**

The code `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the second element of the list `suf[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, the second element of `suf[3]` is incremented. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
