Output State: **`j` is 0; `c` is an integer where shifting `c` right by `j` bits and performing bitwise AND with 1 results in a non-zero value; `suf[0][1]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, the specific element being modified is `suf[0][1]`. Since `c` is an integer where shifting `c` right by `j` bits (which is 0) and performing bitwise AND with 1 results in a non-zero value, the value of `c` remains unchanged. All other variables remain in their initial states.
