Output State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `suf[j][0]` is the count of bits set to 0 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur` plus 1, and `suf[j][1]` is the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`, and the least significant bit of `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Since `j` is 0, `suf[j][0]` was initially the count of bits set to 0 from the 0-th bit (least significant bit) to the most significant bit of `cur`. After executing the code, `suf[j][0]` now includes this count plus one. All other variables remain unchanged.
