Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ans` is 0, `i` is the index right after the last checked substring plus 3, `s` is the next substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the new `i`, `a` is updated to the input string**.

Explanation: The code sets `ans` to 0. All other variables (`a`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `a` is updated to the input string, but since the initial state already mentions `a` as an input integer, it's implied that `a` is now treated as a string.
