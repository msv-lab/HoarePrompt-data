Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        print(s)
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and its length must be greater than 2 * (number of 'map' or 'pie' substrings found), `ans` is equal to the total number of times the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `i` is the index right after the last checked substring, `s` is the last substring of `a` with a length of 3 that was checked during the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will hold the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `a`, and `i` will be set to the index right after the last substring of length 3 that was checked. The value of `a` itself does not change; it remains as the original input integer within the specified range.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` is an input string with a length greater than or equal to the maximum length checked after 3 iterations (which was 11), `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' found in `a` starting from index 3 with a step of 3 until the end of the string, `i` is the final index where the loop stopped, which is `len(a) - 2`, `s` is the last 3-character substring of `a` starting from the index just before the loop terminates, and `a` is updated to the input string.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `a` remains the same as the input string, `ans` holds the total count of 'map' or 'pie' found in specified substrings, `i` is the index right before the loop would exit, and `s` is the last 3-character substring considered by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `a`, `i` is the final index where the loop stops, and `s` is the last printed substring which could be 'map', 'pie', or any other 3-character substring depending on the positions of these substrings in `a`.

To determine the exact values, we need to consider the possible paths the loop can take based on the given conditions:

- If 'map' or 'pie' appears in the string `a` at positions that allow the loop to increment `i` by 3 each time, `ans` will increase by 1 for each occurrence.
- The loop continues until `i` reaches or exceeds `len(a) - 2`.

Given the information provided, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are substrings 'map' or 'pie' within the bounds of the string. The final value of `ans` will be the total count of such substrings, and `i` will be the index just beyond the last occurrence of 'map' or 'pie' (or `len(a) - 2` if no such substrings are found).

The exact values of `ans` and `i` depend on the content of the string `a`. However, without the actual string `a`, we can only describe the general state after all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
