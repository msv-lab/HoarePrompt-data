Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a throwaway variable to iterate over the range returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value doesn't matter for the loop to execute. What matters is the input that determines the number of iterations. The input is obtained using `int(input())`, which means the loop will run based on the integer value entered by the user.

3. **State the necessary adjustments**: Given that the loop will run based on the integer value entered by the user, we need to ensure that the input is valid. Specifically, the input should be a positive integer within the range specified (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input that will be read from the user.

**Final Answer:**
State: **The input must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
