Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and its length must be greater than 9, `ans` is 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' starting from index 7 and having length 3, otherwise `ans` is 2, `i` is 10, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 and having length 3**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially set to 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' starting from index 7 and having length 3, otherwise it is 1. The code `ans += 1` increments `ans` by 1. Therefore, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` becomes 3, otherwise it becomes 2. The values of `a`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.
