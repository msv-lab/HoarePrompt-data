Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) containing lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function counts and prints the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie'. After processing all test cases, the function prints the count for each case.**
