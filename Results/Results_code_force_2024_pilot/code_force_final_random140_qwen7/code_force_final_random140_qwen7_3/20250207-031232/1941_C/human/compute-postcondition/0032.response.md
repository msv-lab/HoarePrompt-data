Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- Its length must be greater than \(2 \times (\text{number of 'map' or 'pie' substrings found})\).
- `ans` is equal to the total number of times the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'.
- `i` is the index right after the last checked substring.
- `s` is the last substring of `a` with a length of 3 that was checked during the loop.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the input integer a)**
