Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and its length must be greater than 9, `ans` is 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' starting from index 7 and having length 3, otherwise `ans` is 1, `i` is 7, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 and having length 3, `s` is updated to the substring of `a` starting from index 7 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` extracts a substring of `a` starting from index `i` (which is 7) and having a length of 3. This substring is assigned to `s`. The other variables (`a`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
