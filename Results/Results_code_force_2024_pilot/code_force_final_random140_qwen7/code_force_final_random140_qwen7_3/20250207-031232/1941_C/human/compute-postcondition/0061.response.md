Output State: **`a` has a length greater than 11; `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i+1` and having a length of 3; `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so the starting index of the substring `s` changes from `i` to `i+1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
