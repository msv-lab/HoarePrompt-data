Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from `len(a) - 3` and ending at `len(a) - 1`, and `a` is updated to the new input string, with `len(a)` being greater than 2, and `s` is now the substring `a[0:3]`, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables (`ans`, `s`, and `a`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
