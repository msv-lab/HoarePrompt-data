Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and len(a) must be greater than 2; `ans` is 0; `i` is 1; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3. The substring `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. All other variables (`a`, `ans`, `s`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
