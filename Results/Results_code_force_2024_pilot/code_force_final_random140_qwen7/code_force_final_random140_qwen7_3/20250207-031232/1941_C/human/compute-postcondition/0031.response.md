Output State: `a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and its length must be greater than 2 * (number of 'map' or 'pie' substrings found), `ans` is equal to the total number of times the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `i` is the index right after the last checked substring, `s` is the last substring of `a` with a length of 3 that was checked during the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will hold the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `a`, and `i` will be set to the index right after the last substring of length 3 that was checked. The value of `a` itself does not change; it remains as the original input integer within the specified range.
