Output State: **`ans` is either 2 or 1, `i` is either 6 or 6, `s` is the substring 'a[5:8]'**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 7 or 5, it now becomes either 6 or 6 (if `i` was 5, it becomes 6; if `i` was 7, it remains 6 because adding 1 to 7 results in 8, but the problem specifies `i` is either 7 or 5). The values of `ans` and `s` remain unchanged.
