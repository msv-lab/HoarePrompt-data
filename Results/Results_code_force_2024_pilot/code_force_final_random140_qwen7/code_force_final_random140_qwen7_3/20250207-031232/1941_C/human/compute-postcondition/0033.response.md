Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The loop variable `_` is used here, but it is typically ignored in the loop body since it is not referenced. The key variables involved in the loop are `a`, `ans`, `i`, and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Logic:**
   - The loop runs for each input integer `t` (where `t` is read from the user using `int(input())`).
   - For each `t`, the loop checks substrings of `a` of length 3.
   - `ans` keeps track of the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie'.
   - `i` is the index right after the last checked substring.
   - `s` is the last substring of `a` with a length of 3 that was checked during the loop.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop runs for each input integer `t`, the initial state of `a` does not change.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the substrings found in `a`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 3 after checking each substring of length 3.
   - `s` will be the next substring of length 3 starting from the current `i`.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:

- `a` remains the same as the original input integer.
- `ans` will be updated based on the new substrings found.
- `i` will be incremented by 3.
- `s` will be the next substring of length 3 starting from the new `i`.

**State at the start of the next iteration:**
- `a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and its length must be greater than 2 * (number of 'map' or 'pie' substrings found) + 3.
- `ans` is equal to the total number of times the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' plus the count from the previous iteration.
- `i` is the index right after the last checked substring plus 3.
- `s` is the next substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the new `i`.

State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and its length must be greater than 2 * (number of 'map' or 'pie' substrings found) + 3, `ans` is equal to the total number of times the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' plus the count from the previous iteration, `i` is the index right after the last checked substring plus 3, `s` is the next substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the new `i`**.
