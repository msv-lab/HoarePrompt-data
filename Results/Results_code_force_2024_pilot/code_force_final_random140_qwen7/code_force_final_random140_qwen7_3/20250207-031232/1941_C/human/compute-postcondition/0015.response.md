Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ans` is 1 if s is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 4, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3, `s` is assigned the value of the substring of `a` starting from index 4 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` extracts a substring of `a` starting from index `i` (which is 4) and having a length of 3. This substring is stored in the variable `s`. The values of `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is now the substring of `a` starting from index 4 and having length 3. The condition for `ans` remains the same, depending on whether `s` is 'map' or 'pie'.
