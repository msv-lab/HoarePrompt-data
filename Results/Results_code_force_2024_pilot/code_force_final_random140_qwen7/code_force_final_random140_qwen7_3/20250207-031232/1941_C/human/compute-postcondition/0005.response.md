Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and len(a) must be greater than 2; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` creates a substring `s` from the string `a` starting at index `i` and taking the next 3 characters. Since `i` is 0, `s` will be the first 3 characters of `a`. The values of `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
