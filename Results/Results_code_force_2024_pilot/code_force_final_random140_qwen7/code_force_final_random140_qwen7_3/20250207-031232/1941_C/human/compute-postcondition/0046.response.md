Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ans` is 0, `i` is 4, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index 3 with a length of 3, `a` is updated to the input string, `len(a)` is greater than 5, and the substring `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
