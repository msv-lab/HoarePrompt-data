Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`.
2. **Current state**: 
   - `ans` is either 2 or 1.
   - `i` is either 7 or 5.
   - `s` is the substring 'a[1:4]', depending on whether `s` equals 'map' or 'pie'.
   - If `s` is 'map', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7.
   - If `s` is 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(a) - 2`.
   - We need to ensure that the condition `i < len(a) - 2` holds true for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` can be either 7 or 5, we need to check if these values satisfy the condition `i < len(a) - 2`.

4. **Check the values of `i`**:
   - If `i` is 7, then `i < len(a) - 2` will hold true as long as `len(a) > 9`.
   - If `i` is 5, then `i < len(a) - 2` will hold true as long as `len(a) > 7`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `len(a)` must be greater than 7 (since both 7 and 5 need to satisfy the condition).
   - The values of `ans` and `s` do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is either 2 or 1, `i` is either 7 or 5, `s` is the substring 'a[1:4]', and `len(a)` must be greater than 7**.
