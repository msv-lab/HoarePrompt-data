Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The program counts the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' but does not remove any characters to make the string beautiful. Instead, it simply prints the count of these substrings, which is not what the problem requires. The problem asks for the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful, not the count of 'map' and 'pie' substrings.

The program should keep track of the indices where 'map' or 'pie' appear and remove those characters to minimize deletions. However, the current implementation does not do this; it only increments the counter `ans` without actually removing any characters.

Therefore, the program is incorrect according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
