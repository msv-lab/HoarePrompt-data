Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **String Processing**: For each test case, the program iterates through the string `a` with a sliding window of size 3 to check for the substrings "map" and "pie". This approach ensures that all possible 3-character substrings are checked.
3. **Counting Substrings**: The program increments the counter `ans` whenever it finds either "map" or "pie" in the current 3-character substring. This is done correctly.
4. **Output**: The final value of `ans` is printed, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. This is also correct.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
- The program only checks for "map" and "pie" in 3-character substrings but does not account for overlapping occurrences. For example, in the string "mapmap", the program would only count one occurrence of "map" instead of two.
- The program does not handle the case where the string might contain both "map" and "pie" without removing more characters than necessary.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we remove the minimum number of characters by considering overlapping occurrences and ensuring that we do not double-count substrings.

Given the current logic, the program does not fully address the requirement of removing the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
