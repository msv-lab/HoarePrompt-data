Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function.
2. The function iterates through the string `a` in chunks of 3 characters using a sliding window approach.
3. It checks if the current chunk is either "map" or "pie". If it is, it increments the counter `ans` and skips the next two characters.
4. If the chunk is neither "map" nor "pie", it simply moves to the next character.
5. The loop ensures that all possible 3-character substrings are checked without overlapping.
6. The final value of `ans` represents the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".
7. The function handles multiple test cases as specified, reading each test case's length `n` and string `s`, and printing the result for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program accurately reflects the intended functionality and logic of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
