Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the removal of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program increments `i` by 3 when it finds the substrings "map" or "pie". This means it skips three characters at a time, but it should only increment `i` by 1 after processing each character. Instead, it should continue checking the remaining characters to ensure the minimum number of deletions is made.

2. **Output Issue**: The program prints the substring `s` and the count `ans` at the end of each test case, which is not required according to the problem statement. It should only output the final count for each test case.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a):
            if i + 2 < len(a) and (a[i:i+3] == 'map' or a[i:i+3] == 'pie'):
                ans += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly counts the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful.
