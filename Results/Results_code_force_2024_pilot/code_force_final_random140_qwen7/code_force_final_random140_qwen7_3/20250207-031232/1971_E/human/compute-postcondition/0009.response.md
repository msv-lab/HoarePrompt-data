Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.
   - `a` retains its original values.
   - `i` retains its original value.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `ad` will have a new element at the end, which is `a[k + 1] - a[k]`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k + 1`.
   - `ad` will have an additional element, which is `a[k + 1] - a[k]`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `a` retains its original values, and `i` is `i + 1`**. 

Since `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `a` retains its original values, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
