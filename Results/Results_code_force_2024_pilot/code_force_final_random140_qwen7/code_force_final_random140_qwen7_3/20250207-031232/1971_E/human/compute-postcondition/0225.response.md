Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and \( q \), along with lists \( a \) and \( b \). For each test case, it handles \( q \) queries, where each query involves finding a value based on the elements in lists \( a \) and \( b \). Specifically, for each query, it calculates and prints a cumulative sum involving elements from \( b \) and differences between consecutive elements in \( a \). After processing all queries for a test case, it moves to the next test case until all \( t \) test cases are handled. The final state includes the completion of all queries for each test case, with no explicit return values.**
