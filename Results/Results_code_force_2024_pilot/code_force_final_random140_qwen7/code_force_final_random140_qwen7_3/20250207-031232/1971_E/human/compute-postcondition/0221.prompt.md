Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `v` will contain the values of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for every `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, `len(b)` will remain at least 1 and less than `len(a)`, and the lists `ad` and `bd` will remain unchanged from their initial state after the loop completes.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `v` will contain the division of each pair of consecutive elements' differences from the lists `ad` and `bd`. Specifically, `v` will contain `[ad[1]/bd[1], ad[2]/bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1]/bd[len(a)-1]]`. The variable `i` will be set to the length of list `a`, and the lengths and contents of lists `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd` will not change.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` is `1 + (bd[s] * ql) // ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` is `1 + (bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]))`, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`, `l` is `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is `1 + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`, `l` is `q - 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
