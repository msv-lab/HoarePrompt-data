Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `t` is set to the input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
        print(m, end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 1, `l` is equal to the total number of iterations `q`, `m` is the cumulative sum of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` for each iteration, `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]` for each iteration, and `q` remains unchanged from its initial value. The variable `v` remains as `[ad[1]/bd[1], ad[2]/bd[2], ad[3]/bd[3], ..., ad[len(a)-1]/bd[len(a)-1]]`, and `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will still be 1 because it is not modified within the loop. `l` will be equal to `q`, which is the total number of iterations. The variable `m` will hold the sum of the values calculated in each iteration, specifically `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`. The variable `ql` will be reduced by `a[s - 1]` for each iteration, and `q` will retain its original value since it is not modified in the loop. The lists `v`, `ad`, and `bd` will remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the cumulative effect of `bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` for each iteration, `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]` for each iteration until it becomes zero or negative, `l` is `q`, `s` is the final index found by `bisect_left(a, ql)` when `ql` is zero or negative.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop will have executed `q` times, resulting in `m` being equal to `1 + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`. The value of `i` will be 1, `q` will be `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` will remain unchanged, `ql` will be the final input integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` will be the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`, and `l` will be `0` since the loop has completed all its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
