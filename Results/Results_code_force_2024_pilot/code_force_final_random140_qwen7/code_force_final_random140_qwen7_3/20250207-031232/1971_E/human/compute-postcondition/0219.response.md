Output State: **`m` is `1 + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`, `l` is `q - 1`**.

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]` to its original value of 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ql` is adjusted to `ql - a[s - 1]`, and `s` remains the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`. The values of `ad`, `bd`, `i`, `q`, `l`, and the list `a` itself are not altered.
