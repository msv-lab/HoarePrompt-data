Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `b`. Therefore, the variable `i` is the only one that can be adjusted within the loop head.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. The loop will increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration, so `i` will become 3.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop condition is `i < len(b)`. Since `i` will be incremented to 3, the loop will continue if `len(b) > 3`.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to update the state of `i` to reflect its new value after the increment. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `a` is a list, `b` is a list, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the first element to the last element, `bd` is a list with one additional element which is `b[1] - b[0]` and `bd` has the appended value `b[i] - b[i - 1]`**
