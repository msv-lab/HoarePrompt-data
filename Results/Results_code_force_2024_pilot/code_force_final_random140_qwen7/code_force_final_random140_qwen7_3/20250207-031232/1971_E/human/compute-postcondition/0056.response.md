Output State: **`i` is 1; `m` is increased by `b[s - 1]`; `ql` is decreased by `a[s - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `m += b[s - 1]` increases the value of `m` by `b[s - 1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Similarly, the value of `ql` is decreased by `a[s - 1]`, but the exact value of `ql` after this operation cannot be specified without knowing the initial value of `ql` and the value of `a[s - 1]`. However, the change in `ql` is noted.
