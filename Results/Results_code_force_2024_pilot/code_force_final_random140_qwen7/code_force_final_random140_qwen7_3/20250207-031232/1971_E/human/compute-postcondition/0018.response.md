Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - `bd` is a list with one element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `len(b) - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

4. **Update the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - `len(b)` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of the list `b`.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - `i` should be updated to 3.
   - `bd` remains unchanged as it does not depend on `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `bd` is a list with one element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`**
