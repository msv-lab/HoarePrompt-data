Output State: **`m` is `bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `m` by adding `bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` to its current value. The other variables (`i`, `ql`, `l`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `m` is expressed as the sum of its original value (`b[s - 1]`) and the new addition (`bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`).
