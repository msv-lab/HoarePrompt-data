Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the cumulative effect of `bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` for each iteration, `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]` for each iteration until it becomes zero or negative, `l` is `q`, `s` is the final index found by `bisect_left(a, ql)` when `ql` is zero or negative, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `q` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the values of `n`, `k`, and `q` are now known, but their specific values are not provided. The variables `i`, `m`, `ql`, `l`, `s`, and `t` remain unchanged from their previous states.
