Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a list, `b` is a list, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the first element to the last element, `bd` is a list with one additional element which is `b[1] - b[0]` and `bd` has the appended value `b[i] - b[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `b[i] - b[i - 1]` translates to `b[2] - b[1]`. Therefore, `bd` now contains an additional element, which is the difference between `b[2]` and `b[1]`. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
