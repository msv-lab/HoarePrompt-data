Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split.**

The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `q`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `k`, and `q` are dependent on the input provided by the user.
