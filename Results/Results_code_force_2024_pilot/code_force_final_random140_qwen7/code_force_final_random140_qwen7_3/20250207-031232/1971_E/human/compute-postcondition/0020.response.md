Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

3. **Check the length of the list `b`**: Since `bd` is a list with two elements, it means that `len(b)` must be 5 (because the elements in `bd` are calculated as `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[3] - b[2]`, which implies there are at least 4 elements in `b`).

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value of 3. Therefore, `i` will be 4.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. The list `b` and the list `bd` do not change within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 4**
