To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `m` is defined as `m + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`
   - `i` is 1
   - `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`
   - `l` is `ql + 1`
   - `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `bd`, `ad`, `a`, `s`, `ql` are not explicitly defined with values in the initial state. We need to infer their values from the context or assume they are defined elsewhere in the program.
   - `i` is explicitly defined as 1.
   - `l` is derived from `ql` and `s`.

3. **Operations:**
   - `m` is updated based on the formula `m + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`.
   - `ql` is updated by subtracting `a[s - 1]` from its current value.
   - `l` is calculated as `ql + 1`.
   - `s` is determined by the `bisect_left` function, which finds the leftmost index where `ql` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(m, end=' ')` will print the value of `m` followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the operations, we can conclude that the value of `m` will be computed based on the provided formula and the values of `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`. Since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only describe `m` in terms of these variables.

Output: **m (where m is the value computed as m + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]))**
