Output State: **`i` remains 1, `l` remains equal to `q`, `m` remains the cumulative sum of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` for each iteration, `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]` for each iteration, `q` remains unchanged from its initial value, `v`, `ad`, and `bd` remain unchanged, `n` is now the first input integer, `k` is now the second input integer, `a` is a list containing 0 followed by integers from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. It then concatenates this list to the existing list `[0]`, resulting in the updated list `b`. The initial values of `i`, `l`, `m`, `ql`, `q`, `v`, `ad`, `bd`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged except for the addition of the new list to `b`.
