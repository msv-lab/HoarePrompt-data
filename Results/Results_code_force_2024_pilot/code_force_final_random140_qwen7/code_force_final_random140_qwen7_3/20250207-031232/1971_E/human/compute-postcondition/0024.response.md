Output State: **`i` is 5; `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in the list `b`, specifically `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], b[3] - b[2], b[4] - b[3]]`; `v` is a list containing the value `[0]`; the variables `a` and `ad` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The given code snippet initializes a list `v` with the value `[0]`. No changes are made to the variables `i`, `bd`, `a`, or `ad` within the provided code snippet. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
