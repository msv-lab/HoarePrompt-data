Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v` now contains `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]` and `ad[i] / bd[i]`.
   - `i` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`.
   - `len(b)` is at least `1` and less than `len(a)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`.

5. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` was within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, incrementing `i` by 1 will make it `i + 1`.
   - To ensure `i + 1` is still within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `k`, it will become `k + 1`.
   - `len(a)` remains unchanged.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `v` will contain `ad[(i+1)+1] / bd[(i+1)+1]` and `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]`.
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `k`, it will become `k + 1`.
- `len(a)` remains unchanged.
- `len(b)` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`v` now contains `ad[i+2] / bd[i+2]` and `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]`, `i` is within the range `2` to `len(a) - 1`, `len(b)` is at least `1` and less than `len(a)`**
