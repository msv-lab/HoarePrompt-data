Output State: **`i` is 1; `ql` is an input integer; `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
