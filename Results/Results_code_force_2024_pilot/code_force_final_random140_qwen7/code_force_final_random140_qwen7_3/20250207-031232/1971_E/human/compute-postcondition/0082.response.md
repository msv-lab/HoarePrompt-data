Output State: **`a` is a list with more than one element; `ad` is a list that includes an additional element which is the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends to `ad` the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]`. Since `len(a) > 1`, the list `a` has at least two elements, allowing the subtraction to occur. The length of `ad` increases by one due to the append operation.
