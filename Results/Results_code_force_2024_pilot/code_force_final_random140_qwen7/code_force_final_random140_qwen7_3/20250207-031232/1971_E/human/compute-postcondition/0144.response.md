Output State: **`m` is 0 + `b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` is `ql + 1`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`**.

In natural language: The value of `m` is updated to be the original value of `m` (which is 0) plus `b[s - 1]`. The values of `i`, `ql`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
