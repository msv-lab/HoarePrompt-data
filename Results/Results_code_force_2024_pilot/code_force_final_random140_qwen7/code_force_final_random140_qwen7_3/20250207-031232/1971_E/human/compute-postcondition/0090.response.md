Output State: **`a` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 1, `bd` is a list with an additional element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Since `i` is 1, the difference calculated is `b[1] - b[0]`. The initial state of `a` and `i` remains unchanged.
