Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1` because `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.
   - `a` retains its original values.
   - `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2` (because it starts at `1` and increments by `1`).
   - The value of `ad` will have another element added, which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]` where `i` is now `i + 2`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ad` will have an additional element based on the new value of `i`.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `i` will be `i + 2` for the next iteration.

Given the above analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `ad` has a new element which is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `a` retains its original values, and `i` is `i + 2`**
