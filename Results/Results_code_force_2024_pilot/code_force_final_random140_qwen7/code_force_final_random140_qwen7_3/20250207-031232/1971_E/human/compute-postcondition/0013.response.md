Output State: **`ad` now contains `a[i + 1] - a[i]` and `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `a` retains its original values, and `i` is `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Initially, `ad` contains `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. After executing the code, `ad` will contain both `a[i + 1] - a[i]` and `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
