Output State: **`v` now contains the value of `ad[k+1] / bd[k+1]` appended with `ad[i] / bd[i]`, `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged, `i` is `k + 1`, and `i` must be less than `len(a)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Initially, `v` contained the value of `ad[k+1] / bd[k+1]`. After appending, `v` now contains both `ad[k+1] / bd[k+1]` and `ad[i] / bd[i]`. The variables `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged, and `i` is still `k + 1`, which must be less than `len(a)`.
