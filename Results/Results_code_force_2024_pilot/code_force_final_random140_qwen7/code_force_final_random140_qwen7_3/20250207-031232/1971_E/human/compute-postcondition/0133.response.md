To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression for `m`.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`.
   - `m` is calculated as `bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `l` is `q`.

2. **Expression for `m`:**
   - `m = bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1]`.
   - Here, `bd[s]` and `ad[s]` are elements from the lists `bd` and `ad` respectively, indexed by `s`.
   - `b[s - 1]` is an element from the list `b`, indexed by `s - 1`.
   - `ql` is updated after the calculation of `m`.

3. **Values:**
   - Since the exact values of `bd`, `ad`, `b`, `a`, `q`, `ql`, and `s` are not provided, we need to express `m` in terms of these variables.
   - `s` is determined by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, which means `s` is the smallest index such that `a[s] >= ql`.

Given this breakdown, the expression for `m` is:

\[ m = bd[s] \times (ql - a[s-1]) // ad[s] + b[s-1] \]

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `m` with a space at the end (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **bd[s] * (ql - a[s-1]) // ad[s] + b[s-1] (where s is the result of bisect_left(a, ql))**
