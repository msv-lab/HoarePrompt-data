Postcondition: `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`, `l` is `q`. If `a[s] == ql`, the condition holds as is.
