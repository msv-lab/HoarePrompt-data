Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the sequence `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list with more than one element.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `bd` is a list with an additional element which is `b[2] - b[1]`, and it now includes `b[i] - b[i - 1]` which is `b[2] - b[1]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b)`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, and at the end of the previous iteration `i` was 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.

5. **Adjust the state of `bd`**: For the next iteration, `bd` should include `b[i] - b[i - 1]` where `i` is now 3. This means `bd` should include `b[3] - b[2]`.

6. **State the updated conditions**:
   - `a` remains a list with more than one element.
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `bd` will include `b[3] - b[2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 3, `bd` is a list with an additional element which is `b[3] - b[2]`**.
