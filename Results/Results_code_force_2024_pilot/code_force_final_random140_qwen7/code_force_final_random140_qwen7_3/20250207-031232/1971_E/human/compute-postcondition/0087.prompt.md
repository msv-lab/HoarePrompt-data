Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` remains 1, `l` remains equal to `q`, `m` remains the cumulative sum of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` for each iteration, `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]` for each iteration, `q` remains unchanged from its initial value, `v` remains unchanged, `ad` is updated to be `[0]`, `bd` remains unchanged, `n` is now the first input integer, `k` is now the second input integer, `a` is a list containing 0 followed by integers from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list with more than one element; `ad` is a list that includes an additional element which is the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list with more than one element; `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements, and the next difference will be between `a[2]` and `a[1]`; `ad` has an additional element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list with more than one element; `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements, and the next difference will be between `a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[len(a) - 2]`; `ad` has an additional element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
