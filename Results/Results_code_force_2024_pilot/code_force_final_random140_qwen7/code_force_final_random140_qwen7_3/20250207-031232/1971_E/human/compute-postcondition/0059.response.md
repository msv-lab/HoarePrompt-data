Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `l` and `q`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, but `i` is not part of the loop head. Therefore, it does not affect the loop condition directly.

3. **Loop condition**: The loop runs for `l` in the range from 0 to `q-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `q`.

4. **Adjust the state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `l` would be equal to the previous value of `l` plus 1. Since the loop just started, `l` should be 0 (the first iteration).

5. **Update the state**: Since `l` starts from 0, the new state for `l` should be 0. The value of `q` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `m` is increased by `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`, `ql` is decreased by `a[s - 1]`, `l` is 0, `q` is unchanged**.

However, since the question asks to focus only on the loop head variables (`l` and `q`), the final answer is:

State: **`l` is 0, `q` is unchanged**.
