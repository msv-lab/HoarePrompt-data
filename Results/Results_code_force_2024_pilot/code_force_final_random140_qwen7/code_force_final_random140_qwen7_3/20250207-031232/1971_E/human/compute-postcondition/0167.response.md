Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` is a list, `b` is a list, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the first element to the last element, `bd` is a list with one additional element which is `b[1] - b[0]` and `bd` has the appended value `b[3] - b[2]`**.

Explanation: The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `b[i] - b[i - 1]` translates to `b[3] - b[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
