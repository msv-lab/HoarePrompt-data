Output State: **`i` is 2; `bd` is a list with one element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i-1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the difference `b[1] - b[0]` is calculated and appended to `bd`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (though the increment itself is not explicitly shown in the code, the next time this line is run, `i` would be 2), and `bd` contains the calculated difference. The condition `len(b) > 1` remains valid as it was a precondition.
