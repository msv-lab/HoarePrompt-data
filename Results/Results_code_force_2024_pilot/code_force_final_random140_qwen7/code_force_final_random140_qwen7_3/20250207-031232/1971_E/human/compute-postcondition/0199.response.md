Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`, `l` is `q`.**

Explanation: The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` updates the variable `s` to be the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in the list `a`, or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`. The values of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `q`, `ad`, `bd`, `ql`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
