Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is an input integer.**

The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `ql`. The values of `m`, `i`, `q`, `ad`, and `bd` remain unchanged from their initial states.
