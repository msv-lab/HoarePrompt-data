Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is `q + 1`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`**.

Explanation: The variable `ql` is assigned the value of an integer input from the user using `int(input())`. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `l`, and `s`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state, with `m` being 0, `i` being 1, `l` being `q + 1`, and `s` being the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`.
