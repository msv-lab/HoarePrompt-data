Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` is `ql + 1`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`**.

Explanation: The code `ql -= a[s - 1]` subtracts the value of `a[s - 1]` from `ql`. The values of `m`, `i`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, `m` stays as 0, `i` remains 1, `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` is still `ql + 1`, and `s` retains its value as the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`.
