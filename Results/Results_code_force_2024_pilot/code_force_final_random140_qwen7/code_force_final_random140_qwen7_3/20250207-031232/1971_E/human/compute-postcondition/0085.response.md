Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` and the range as `range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Determine the Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a list with more than one element.
   - `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The next difference will be between `a[2]` and `a[1]`.
   - `ad` has an additional element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < len(a)`.
   - Therefore, if `i` is currently `len(a) - 1`, the loop will stop.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(a) - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `len(a) - 1`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `a` remains the same as it did not change within the loop.
   - `ad` should include the new difference `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a list with more than one element; `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements, and the next difference will be between `a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[len(a) - 2]`; `ad` has an additional element which is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`.**
