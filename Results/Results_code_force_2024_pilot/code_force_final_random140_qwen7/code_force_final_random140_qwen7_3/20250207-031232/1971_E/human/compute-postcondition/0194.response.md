To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression for `m`.

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `m` is defined as `1 + (bd[s] * ql) // ad[s]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `q` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, meaning they retain their previous values.
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`.

2. **Expression for `m`:**
   - `m = 1 + (bd[s] * ql) // ad[s]`
   - Here, `bd[s]` and `ad[s]` are specific values from the lists `bd` and `ad` at index `s`.
   - `ql` is the current value of `ql` after being updated by subtracting `a[s - 1]`.

Since the exact values of `bd`, `ad`, and `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we can describe it based on the given formula.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Given the above, the output will be:

Output: **1 + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) // ad[s]**
