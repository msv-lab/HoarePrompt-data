Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`, `l` is `q`.**

The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
