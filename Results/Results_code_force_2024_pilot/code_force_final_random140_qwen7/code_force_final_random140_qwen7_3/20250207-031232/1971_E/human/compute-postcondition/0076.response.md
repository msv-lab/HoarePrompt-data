Output State: **`i` remains 1, `l` remains equal to `q` (the total number of iterations), `m` remains the cumulative sum of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` for each iteration, `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]` for each iteration, `q` remains unchanged from its initial value, `v`, `ad`, and `bd` remain unchanged, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. The other variables (`i`, `l`, `m`, `ql`, `v`, `ad`, `bd`) are not affected by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
