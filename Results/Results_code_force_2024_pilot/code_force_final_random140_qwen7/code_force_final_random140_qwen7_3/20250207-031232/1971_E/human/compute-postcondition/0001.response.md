State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
2. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution. It is used as a dummy variable to iterate `t` times.
3. The key variable here is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will run.
4. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer and within the specified range (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4).
5. Since `t` is set to the input integer, the initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and 10^4 ensures the loop can execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.
