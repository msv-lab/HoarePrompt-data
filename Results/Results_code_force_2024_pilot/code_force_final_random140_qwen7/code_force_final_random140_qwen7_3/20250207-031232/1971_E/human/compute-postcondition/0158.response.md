Output State: **`i` is 2; `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2 and `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`. The code snippet appends `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`. Therefore, `ad` now contains `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
