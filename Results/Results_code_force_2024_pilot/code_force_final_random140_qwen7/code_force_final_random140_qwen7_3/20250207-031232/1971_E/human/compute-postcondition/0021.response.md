Output State: **`i` is 4; `bd` is a list with the element `b[4] - b[3]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the 4th element (`b[4]`) and the 3rd element (`b[3]`) of the list `b` to the list `bd`. Since the initial state of `i` is 4, `i` remains unchanged. The value of `bd` is updated to include the calculated difference.
