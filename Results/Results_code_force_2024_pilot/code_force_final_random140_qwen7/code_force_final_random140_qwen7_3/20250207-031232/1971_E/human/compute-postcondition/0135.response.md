Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q + 1`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`**

Explanation: The line `m = 0` sets the variable `m` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `ql`, `l`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
