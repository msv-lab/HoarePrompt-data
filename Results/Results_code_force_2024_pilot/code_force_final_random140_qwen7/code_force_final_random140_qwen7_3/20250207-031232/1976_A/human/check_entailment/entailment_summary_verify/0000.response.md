### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Passwords must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- No digit should come after a letter.
- All digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
- All letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each password and separates the characters into `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` and `digits` are sorted.
   - It then checks if the last letter comes before the first digit in the password.

2. **Key Points:**
   - The function correctly checks if the `letters` and `digits` are sorted.
   - The function checks if the last letter comes before the first digit, which ensures that no digit comes after a letter at the end of the password.
   - However, the function does not ensure that no digit comes after a letter throughout the entire password.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` processes each password to check if the letters and digits are in sorted order and if the last letter comes before the first digit in the password.
- If all passwords fail these checks, it returns a list with 'NO' repeated for the number of passwords.
- Otherwise, it returns a list with 'NO' followed by 'YES' if at least one password passes the checks.

#### Original Assessment Recap:
- The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly handle the condition where there should be no digit that comes after a letter.
- Specifically, the program checks if the last letter comes before the first digit, which is not sufficient to ensure that no digit comes after a letter throughout the entire password.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The function `func_1` indeed does not fully meet the requirement that no digit should come after a letter throughout the entire password. It only checks the position of the last letter and the first digit.
- To correctly verify the condition, the program needs to ensure that for every character in the password, if it is a digit, all previous characters up to that point must be digits.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not fully meet the requirement specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not fully ensure that no digit comes after a letter throughout the entire password.
