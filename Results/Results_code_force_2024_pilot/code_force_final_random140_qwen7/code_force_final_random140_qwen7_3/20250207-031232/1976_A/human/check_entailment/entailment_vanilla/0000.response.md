Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it separates the password into letters and digits.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order:
     - If either the letters or digits are not sorted, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - It then checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter:
     - If such a digit exists, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If neither of the above conditions fail, it appends 'YES' to the results.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the password consists only of letters or only of digits correctly.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the password has both letters and digits and ensures that the digits come before any letters.

### Verification

Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Password: `12ac`
   - Letters: `a, c`
   - Digits: `1, 2`
   - Both letters and digits are sorted.
   - No digit comes after a letter.
   - Result: `YES`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Password: `123wa`
   - Letters: `w, a`
   - Digits: `1, 2, 3`
   - Letters are not sorted.
   - Result: `NO`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Password: `allllmost`
   - Letters: `a, l, l, l, l, o, s, t`
   - Digits: None
   - Letters are sorted.
   - No digit comes after a letter.
   - Result: `YES`

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Password: `ac123`
   - Letters: `a, c`
   - Digits: `1, 2, 3`
   - Letters are sorted.
   - Digits are sorted.
   - Digit `1` comes after letter `c`.
   - Result: `NO`

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Password: `011679`
   - Letters: None
   - Digits: `0, 1, 1, 6, 7, 9`
   - Digits are sorted.
   - No letter comes after a digit.
   - Result: `YES`

The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and follows the rules specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
