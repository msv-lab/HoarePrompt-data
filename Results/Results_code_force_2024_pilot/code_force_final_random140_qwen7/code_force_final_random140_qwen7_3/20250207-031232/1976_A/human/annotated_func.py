#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of strings where each string represents a password consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with each password's length ranging from 1 to 20.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        
        digits = ''
        
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits
            [0]):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
        
    #State: `results` contains either 'NO' repeated as many times as there are elements in `test_cases`, or 'NO' followed by 'YES' if any password meets the conditions to be labeled as 'YES'.
    return results
    #The program returns the string 'results' which contains either 'NO' repeated as many times as there are elements in 'test_cases', or 'NO' followed by 'YES' if any password meets the conditions to be labeled as 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `test_cases`, a list of strings representing passwords. Each password consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has a length between 1 and 20. It processes each password to check if the letters and digits are in sorted order and if the last letter comes before the first digit in the password. If all passwords fail these checks, it returns a list with 'NO' repeated for the number of passwords. Otherwise, it returns a list with 'NO' followed by 'YES' if at least one password passes the checks.
