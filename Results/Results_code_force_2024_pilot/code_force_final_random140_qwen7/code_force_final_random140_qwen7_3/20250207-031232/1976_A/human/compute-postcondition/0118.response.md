Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `test_cases`, a list of strings representing passwords. Each password consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has a length between 1 and 20. The function returns a string named 'results'. If all passwords do not meet certain conditions, 'results' contains 'NO' repeated for the number of elements in `test_cases`. Otherwise, 'results' contains 'NO' followed by 'YES' if at least one password meets the conditions.**
