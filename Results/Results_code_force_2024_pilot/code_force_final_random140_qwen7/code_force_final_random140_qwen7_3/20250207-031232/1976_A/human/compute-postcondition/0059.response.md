Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character (one character more than before if the condition is met, or one character less than before if the condition is not met), `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged. If `ch` is alphabetic, `letters` is updated to include `ch`; otherwise, `ch` is added to `digits`.
