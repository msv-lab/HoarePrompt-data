Postcondition: **`letters` is a string containing the original alphabetic characters plus the character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise it is an empty string; `digits` is a string containing the digit `ch` if `ch` is a digit, and remains unchanged otherwise. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is updated by appending the character `ch` to itself.**
