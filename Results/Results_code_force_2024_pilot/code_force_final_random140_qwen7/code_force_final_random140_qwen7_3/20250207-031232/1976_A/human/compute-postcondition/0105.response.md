Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `letters` will contain all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, and `digits` will contain all the digit characters from the `password` string.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has processed every character in the `password` string, `letters` will hold a concatenation of all alphabetic characters found in the original `password` string, and `digits` will hold a concatenation of all digit characters found in the original `password` string. Any non-alphabetic and non-digit characters in the `password` string will not affect the values of `letters` or `digits`.
