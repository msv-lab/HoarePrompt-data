The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables `results`, `letters`, and `digits` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`results` contains 'NO', `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, and `digits` is a string containing all the digit characters from the `password` string, with each digit repeated according to its occurrence in the `password` string.**
