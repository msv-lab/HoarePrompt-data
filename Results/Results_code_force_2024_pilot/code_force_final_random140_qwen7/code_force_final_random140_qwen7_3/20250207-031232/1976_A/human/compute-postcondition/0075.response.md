Output State: **`results` contains 'NO', 'YES', indicating that either the `letters` variable is not sorted compared to its original state or the `digits` variable is not sorted compared to its original state, and the password's last letter index is less than or equal to the first digit index.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contains `'NO'`. After appending `'YES'`, `results` will contain both `'NO'` and `'YES'`. The conditions regarding the sorting of `letters` and `digits`, as well as the indices of the password's last letter and first digit, remain unchanged.
