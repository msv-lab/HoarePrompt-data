Output State: **`results` contains 'NO', the letters variable is not sorted compared to its original state, and the digits variable is not sorted compared to its original state.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the `results` list. This operation does not affect the `letters` or `digits` variables. The precondition states that the `letters` and `digits` variables, when converted to lists and sorted, do not equal their original lists, which remains true after this line of code is executed.
