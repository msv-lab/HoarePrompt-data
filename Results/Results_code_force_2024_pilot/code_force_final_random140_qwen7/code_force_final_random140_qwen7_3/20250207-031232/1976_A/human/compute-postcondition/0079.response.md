Output State: **`results` contains 'NO', `n` is the next number in `test_cases`, `password` is the next password string in `test_cases`, `letters` is an empty string**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty string `letters`. This does not affect the values of `results`, `n`, or `password`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, while `letters` is explicitly set to an empty string.
