The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. The variables `letters`, `digits`, and `results` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` contains all the digit characters from the `password` string; `results` is a list containing one element 'NO'.**
