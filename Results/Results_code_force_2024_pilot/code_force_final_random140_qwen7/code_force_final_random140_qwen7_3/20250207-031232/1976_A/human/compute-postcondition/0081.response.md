Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ch in password:`. The variables involved in this loop are `ch`, `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `password` is given as the next password string in `test_cases`.
   - `ch` is the character being iterated over in the password string.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in the `password` string. Therefore, the loop will start executing if `password` is not an empty string.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `password` having at least one character, `password` must contain at least one character.
   - The variable `ch` will take on each character of `password` one by one during the iterations, but before the loop starts, `ch` is not defined yet.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `password` must contain at least one character.
- `ch` is not defined before the loop starts, but it will be assigned the first character of `password` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`password` must contain at least one character**
