Output State: **`letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, and `digits` contains all the digit characters from the `password` string; `results` is a list containing one element 'NO'.**

The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. The initial state of `letters` and `digits` remains unchanged. Therefore, `letters` still contains all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, and `digits` still contains all the digit characters from the `password` string. The list `results` now contains one element, which is `'NO'`.
