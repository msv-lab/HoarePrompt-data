Output State: **`results` contains 'NO', 'YES', `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, and `digits` is a string containing all the digit characters from the `password` string, with each digit repeated according to its occurrence in the `password` string. The last alphabetic character in `letters` has an index in `password` that is less than or equal to the index of the first digit in `digits`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contained only `'NO'`. After appending `'YES'`, `results` now contains both `'NO'` and `'YES'`. The values of `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The condition about the indices of the last alphabetic character in `letters` and the first digit in `digits` in the `password` string also remains valid.
