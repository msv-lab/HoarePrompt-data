Output State: **`password` must contain at least one character (one character less than before), `ch` is the next character added to `digits`, `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged**

Explanation: The code `digits += ch` adds the character `ch` to the `digits` variable. The precondition states that `password` must contain at least one character (one character less than before) and `ch` is the next character in `password`. After executing the code, `ch` is added to `digits`, and the states of `password` and `letters` remain unchanged.
