Postcondition: `results` contains 'NO'. If the last character in the `letters` string has a higher index than the first character in the `digits` string within the `password` string, then the second element of `results` is 'NO' and remains unchanged. Otherwise, the second element of `results` is set to 'YES'. `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, and `digits` is a string containing all the digit characters from the `password` string, with each digit repeated according to its occurrence in the `password` string.
