Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ch in password:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ch` (the current character being processed) and `password` (the string being iterated over).

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop processes each character in the `password` string one by one. The postcondition given tells us that if `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` is set to `ch`. If `ch` is a digit, `ch` is added to `digits`. Otherwise, `digits` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `password`, at the start of the next iteration, `ch` will be the next character in the `password` string.
   - The `password` string itself does not change within the loop; it remains the same throughout the iterations.

Given the above points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `password` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `ch` changes to the next character in the `password` string.

Since the postcondition ensures that `password` must contain at least one character, and `ch` is set based on the current character in `password`, the only thing that changes is the value of `ch`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`password` must contain at least one character, `ch` is the next character in `password`**.
