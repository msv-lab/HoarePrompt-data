Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `password`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each test case defined by `test_cases`, where each test case is a tuple `(n, password)`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - `n`: This variable is the first element of the tuple in the `test_cases` list, which is an integer.
   - `password`: This variable is the second element of the tuple in the `test_cases` list, which is a string.

4. **Initial States**:
   - `results` contains 'NO'.
   - If the last character in the `letters` string has a higher index than the first character in the `digits` string within the `password` string, then the second element of `results` is 'NO' and remains unchanged. Otherwise, the second element of `results` is set to 'YES'.
   - `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string.
   - `digits` is a string containing all the digit characters from the `password` string, with each digit repeated according to its occurrence in the `password` string.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each test case, the initial values of `n` and `password` will change for each iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `n` will be the next value from the `test_cases` list, and `password` will be the corresponding string.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `n` and `password`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` contains 'NO', `n` is the next value from the `test_cases` list, `password` is the corresponding string from the `test_cases` list**.
