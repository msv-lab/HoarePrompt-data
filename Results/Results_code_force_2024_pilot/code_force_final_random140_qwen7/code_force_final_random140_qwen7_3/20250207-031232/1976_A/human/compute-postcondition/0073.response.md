Output State: **`results` contains 'NO', indicating that either the `letters` variable is not sorted compared to its original state or the `digits` variable is not sorted compared to its original state. The last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` than the first character of `digits'; `results` now contains two 'NO' entries.**

The code `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Since `results` initially contained one `'NO'`, after appending, it now contains two `'NO'` entries. All other conditions and the relative positions of `letters`, `digits`, and `password` remain unchanged.
