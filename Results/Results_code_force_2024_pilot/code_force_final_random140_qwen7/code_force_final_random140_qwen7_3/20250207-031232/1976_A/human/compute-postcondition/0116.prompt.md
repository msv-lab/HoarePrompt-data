Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of strings where each string represents a password consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with each password's length ranging from 1 to 20.
Code of the loop:
for n, password in test_cases:
    letters = ''
    digits = ''
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isalpha():
            letters += ch
        elif ch.isdigit():
            digits += ch
    if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(
        digits[0]):
        results.append('NO')
    else:
        results.append('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `results` contains 'NO'. If the last character in the `letters` string has a higher index than the first character in the `digits` string within the `password` string, then the second element of `results` is 'NO' and remains unchanged. Otherwise, the second element of `results` is set to 'YES'. `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, and `digits` is a string containing all the digit characters from the `password` string, with each digit repeated according to its occurrence in the `password` string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `results` contains 'NO', indicating that either the `letters` variable is not sorted compared to its original state or the `digits` variable is not sorted compared to its original state. If the last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` than the first character of `digits`, `results` will contain two 'NO' entries. Otherwise, `results` will contain 'NO' and 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` contains all the digit characters from the `password` string, and `results` is a list containing 'NO'. This list will contain an additional 'YES' if `letters` is not sorted, `digits` is not sorted, or the last character in `letters` appears earlier in the `password` string than the first character in `digits`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
