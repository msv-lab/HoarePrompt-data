Output State: **`letters` is '', `digits` is the current digit `ch`, `ch` is a character from the password.**

Explanation: The code `digits += ch` appends the current character `ch` to the string `digits`. Since the initial state specifies that `ch` is a digit, the updated value of `digits` will be the current digit `ch`. The other variables remain unchanged.
