Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` contains 'NO', `n` is the next number in `test_cases`, `password` is the next password string in `test_cases`, `digits` is an empty string
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, then `letters` is set to `ch`. If `ch` is a digit, then `ch` is added to `digits`. Otherwise, `digits` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character; `ch` is the next character in `password`; if `ch` is a letter, then `letters` now includes the character `ch`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is the concatenation of `digits` and `ch`. If `ch` is neither a letter nor a digit, then both `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character; if `ch` is an alphabetic character, then `letters` is equal to `password` plus the next character in `password`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is the concatenation of `digits` and `ch`. If `ch` is neither an alphabetic character nor a digit, then `digits` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
