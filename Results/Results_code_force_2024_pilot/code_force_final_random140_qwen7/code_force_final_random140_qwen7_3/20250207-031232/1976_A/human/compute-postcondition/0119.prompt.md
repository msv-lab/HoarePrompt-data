You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of strings where each string represents a password consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with each password's length ranging from 1 to 20.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        
        digits = ''
        
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits
            [0]):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
        
    #State: `results` contains either 'NO' repeated as many times as there are elements in `test_cases`, or 'NO' followed by 'YES' if any password meets the conditions to be labeled as 'YES'.
    return results
    #The program returns the string 'results' which contains either 'NO' repeated as many times as there are elements in 'test_cases', or 'NO' followed by 'YES' if any password meets the conditions to be labeled as 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `test_cases`, a list of strings representing passwords. Each password consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has a length between 1 and 20. The function returns a string named 'results'. If all passwords do not meet certain conditions, 'results' contains 'NO' repeated for the number of elements in `test_cases`. Otherwise, 'results' contains 'NO' followed by 'YES' if at least one password meets the conditions.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string 'results' which contains either 'NO' repeated as many times as there are elements in 'test_cases', or 'NO' followed by 'YES' if any password meets the conditions to be labeled as 'YES'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
