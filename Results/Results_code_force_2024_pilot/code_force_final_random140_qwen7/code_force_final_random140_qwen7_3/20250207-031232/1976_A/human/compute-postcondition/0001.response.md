Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `(n, password)` which are unpacked from `test_cases`.

2. **Understand the conditions for loop execution**: For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple of the form `(n, password)`. This means there must be at least one element in `test_cases` that can be unpacked into `n` and `password`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `results` is an empty list and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `t` is a positive integer but does not affect the loop execution directly either.
   - `test_cases` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `test_cases` to ensure it has at least one element that can be unpacked into `n` and `password`.

**State:**
**`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of strings that must have at least one element**.
