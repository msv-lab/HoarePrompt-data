Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ch` and `password`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - For each character `ch` in `password`, the loop updates either `letters` or `digits` based on whether `ch` is alphabetic.
   - The postcondition states that `password` must contain at least one character, and this character count can increase or decrease depending on the condition being met.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `password`, the length of `password` can change based on the condition.
   - `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged within the loop body as per the given information.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `password` must contain at least one character, and this character count can be one more or one less than before.
   - `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the possible changes in the length of `password` while keeping `letters` and `digits` unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`password` must contain at least one character (one character more than before if the condition is met, or one character less than before if the condition is not met), `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged**.
