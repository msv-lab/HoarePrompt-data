Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character; if `ch` is an alphabetic character, then `letters` is equal to `password` plus the next character in `password`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is the concatenation of `digits` and `ch`. If `ch` is neither an alphabetic character nor a digit, then `digits` remains unchanged.
