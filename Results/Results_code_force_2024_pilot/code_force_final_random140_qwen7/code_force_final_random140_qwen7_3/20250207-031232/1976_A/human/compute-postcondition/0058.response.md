Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character (now one character more than before), either `letters` is updated to include `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, or `digits` is updated to include `ch` if `ch` is numeric, while `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged if `ch` is neither alphabetic nor numeric.
