Output State: **`password` must contain at least one non-alphabetic character; `digits` is equal to the previous value of `digits` plus the current character `ch`.**

Explanation: The code increments the `digits` variable by the current character `ch`, which is specified to be a digit. Therefore, `digits` now holds the value of its previous content plus the current digit `ch`. The precondition that `password` must contain at least one non-alphabetic character remains unchanged.
