Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `ch` (the character being processed) and `password` (the string being iterated over).

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `password`.

3. **Postconditions from the Previous Iteration**:
   - `password` must contain at least one character.
   - If `ch` is an alphabetic character, then `letters` is set to `ch`.
   - If `ch` is a non-alphabetic character, `password` will still contain at least one non-alphabetic character and `digits` is incremented by 1 if `ch` is a digit.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `password`, at the start of the next iteration, `ch` will be the next character in `password`.
   - `password` will lose one character since it is being iterated through.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `ch` will be the next character in `password`.
   - `password` will be one character shorter.
   - `letters` and `digits` will remain unchanged unless the new `ch` meets specific conditions (which we cannot assume based on the given information).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the fact that `password` is one character shorter and `ch` is the next character in `password`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`password` must contain at least one character (one character less than before), `ch` is the next character in `password`, `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged**.
