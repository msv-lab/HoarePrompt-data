Output State: **`letters` is a string containing the original alphabetic characters plus the character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic (where `ch` is the next character from `password`), otherwise it is an empty string; `digits` is a string containing the digit `ch` if `ch` is a digit, and remains unchanged otherwise; `digits` is updated by appending the character `ch` to itself.**

This means that the `digits` string now includes the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit. The `letters` string remains unchanged unless `ch` is alphabetic, in which case it would include `ch`. The `digits` string specifically gets appended with `ch`.
