Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, for \( n > 2 \), the program only prints two points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), followed by a loop that prints points starting from \((3, 3)\) up to \((n+2, n+2)\). However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \( n \).

For example, consider \( n = 3 \):
- The program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  4 4
  ```

- The Manhattan distances calculated are:
  - Between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Between \((1, 1)\) and \((3, 3)\): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
  - Between \((1, 1)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
  - Between \((1, 2)\) and \((3, 3)\): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
  - Between \((1, 2)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
  - Between \((3, 3)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(|3-4| + |3-4| = 2\)

- The set of distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 6.

However, the optimal arrangement for \( n = 3 \) should include points \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\) to achieve the maximum set of distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. This shows that the program does not always generate the optimal solution, hence it is incorrect.
