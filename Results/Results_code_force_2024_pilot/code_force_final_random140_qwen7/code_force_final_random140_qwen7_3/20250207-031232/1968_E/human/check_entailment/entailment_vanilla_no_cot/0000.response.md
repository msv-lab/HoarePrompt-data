Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of \( n \). Specifically, the program only prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) followed by a sequence of coordinates \((i, i)\) from \(3\) to \(n+2\). This approach does not necessarily maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \( n \).

For example, for \( n = 3 \), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
```

However, the correct output should include at least three points to achieve the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\), such as:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```

This configuration ensures that the set of distinct Manhattan distances includes \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), which is the maximum possible for \( n = 3 \).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not always produce the optimal set of points to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
