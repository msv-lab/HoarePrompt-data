Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)
        
        print(1, 2)
        
        for i in range(3, n + 2):
            print(i, i)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` will be `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than 4.
    #
    #Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 2`. This is because the loop starts from 3 and increments `i` up to `n + 1`, making the final value of `i` equal to `n + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to run at least once, `n` must be greater than 4. Since the loop runs based on the input `n`, `n` must maintain this condition to complete all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and processes two inputs, `t` and `n`. For each test case defined by `t`, it prints specific pairs of integers. Initially, it prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. Then, it iterates from 3 to `n + 1`, printing each integer twice. After completing all iterations, the final value of the loop variable `i` will be `n + 2`, with the constraint that `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute fully. The function does not return any value.
