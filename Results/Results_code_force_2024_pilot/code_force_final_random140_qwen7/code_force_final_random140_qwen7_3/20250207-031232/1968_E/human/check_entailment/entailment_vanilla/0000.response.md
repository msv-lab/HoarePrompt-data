### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. 

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \(n\).
   - It prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - Then, for each \(i\) from 3 to \(n + 2\), it prints \((i, i)\).

3. **Output Analysis**:
   - For \(n = 2\):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2\}\). This is correct since the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 2\) is 2, but the program outputs 3, which is incorrect.

   - For \(n = 3\):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\). This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) should be 4, not 6.

   - For larger \(n\), the same pattern continues, leading to an incorrect number of distinct Manhattan distances.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for any \(n\). It always includes more points than necessary, leading to a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances than required.

### Correctness:
**False**
