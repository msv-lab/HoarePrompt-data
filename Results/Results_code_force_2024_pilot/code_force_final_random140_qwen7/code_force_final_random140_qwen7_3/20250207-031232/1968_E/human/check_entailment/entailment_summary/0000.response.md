Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\), which consists of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program only handles the first few cases correctly but fails to cover all test cases, especially when \(n > 4\).
3. Specifically, the program prints:
   - \((1, 1)\)
   - \((1, 2)\)
   - A series of pairs \((i, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n+1\).

This approach works for small values of \(n\):
- For \(n = 2\): It prints \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct.
- For \(n = 3\): It prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\), resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which is also correct.

However, for larger values of \(n\), this approach does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). The example provided shows that for \(n = 4\), a better configuration exists that includes more distinct Manhattan distances.

Given the execution summary, the program does not handle all test cases correctly. Therefore, it cannot be considered fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
