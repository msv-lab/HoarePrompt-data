Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly address the problem statement. The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\), which consists of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.
2. The current implementation prints fixed coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for the first two cells, and then prints (i, i) for \(i\) starting from 3 up to \(n + 1\). This approach does not necessarily maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances.
3. For example, when \(n = 2\), the output is:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   3 3
   ```
   The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), but the maximum possible set of distances for \(n = 2\) is \(\{0, 1\}\).

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
