Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(3, n + 2):`.
- This means the loop starts with `i = 3` and ends when `i` reaches `n + 1`.

### Understanding the Loop Head
- The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

### Analyzing the Loop Condition
- The loop continues as long as `i < n + 2`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was some value `k` (where `3 <= k < n + 1`).

### Determining the Next State
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `i` will become `k + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n + 2`, so `k + 1 < n + 2` must hold true.

### Adjusting the States
- The variable `i` needs to be updated to `k + 1`.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

### Example Calculation
- Suppose at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 5 and `n` was 7.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 6.
- The condition `6 < 7 + 2` holds true, so the loop can continue.

### Final State
- `i` is now 6.
- `n` remains 7.

### Answer
State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**.

This ensures that the loop can continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`.
