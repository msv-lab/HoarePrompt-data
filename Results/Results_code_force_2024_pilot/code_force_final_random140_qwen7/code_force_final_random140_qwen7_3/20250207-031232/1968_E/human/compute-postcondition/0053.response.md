Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` must be at least 9.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 5.

The `print` statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `j` is explicitly defined as 5.
2. The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then again with the string representation of `j`.
3. Therefore, the output will be "5 5".

Output: **5 5**
