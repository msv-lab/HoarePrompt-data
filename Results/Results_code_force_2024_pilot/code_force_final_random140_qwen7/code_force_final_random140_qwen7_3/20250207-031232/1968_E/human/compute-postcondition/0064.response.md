Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `n - 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and goes up to `n - 2` (since `n - 1` is excluded).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` must be at least 3

4. **Determine if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, it cannot be incremented further within the current range (`1` to `n - 2`). Therefore, the loop will not execute again because `i` is already at its upper limit.

6. **Final state**:
   - `t` remains as `t - 1` (unchanged).
   - `i` remains as `n - 1` (unchanged).
   - `n` must still be at least 3 (unchanged).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case is the end of the loop) is:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 3**
