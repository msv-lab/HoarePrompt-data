Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
- `i` is 5.

The `print(i, i)` statement will print the value of `i` twice. Since it is explicitly stated that `i` is 5, we can directly use this value.

Output: **5 5**
