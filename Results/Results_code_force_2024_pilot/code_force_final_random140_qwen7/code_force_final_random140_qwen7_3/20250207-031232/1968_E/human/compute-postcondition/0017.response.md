Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 8.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 8.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 3 to `n + 1` (inclusive).

4. **Initial Value of `i`**: Since `i` is initially 8, it will start the loop with `i = 8`.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to start, `i` must be within the range defined by the loop condition, which is from 3 to `n + 1`. Given that `i` starts at 8, `n` must be at least 9 to include 8 in the range.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` should be 8 (as given).
   - `n` must be at least 9 to ensure the loop starts with `i = 8`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` is 8.
- `n` must be at least 9.

State: **`i` is 8, `n` must be at least 9**
