Output State: **`i` is 11, `n` is an input integer**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 11. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value entered by the user. The precondition that `n` must be at least 11 is still valid, but since no specific value was provided in the input, we only know that `n` is an integer input.
