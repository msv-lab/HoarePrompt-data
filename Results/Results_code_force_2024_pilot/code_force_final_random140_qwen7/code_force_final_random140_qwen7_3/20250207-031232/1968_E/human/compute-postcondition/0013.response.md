Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, int(input())):`. The key variables here are `i` and the upper limit of the range, which is determined by `int(input())`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 8.
   - `i` is 7.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i < int(input())`.
   - Since `i` is currently 7, the loop will continue if `int(input()) > 7`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
   - The value of `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 8.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 8.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 8, `i` is 8, and `int(input())` must be greater than 8.**
