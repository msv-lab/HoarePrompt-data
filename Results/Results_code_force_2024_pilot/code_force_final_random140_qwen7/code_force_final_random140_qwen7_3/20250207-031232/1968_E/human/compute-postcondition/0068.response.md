Output State: `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is `0`, `n` must be at least 3.

After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be set to `n - 1` and then decremented by the loop until it reaches 0. Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-2`, it will decrement `i` until it becomes `0`. The value of `t` will also be reduced by 1 for each iteration, hence `t` is `t - 1`. The value of `n` must remain at least 3 to allow the loop to execute at least once.
