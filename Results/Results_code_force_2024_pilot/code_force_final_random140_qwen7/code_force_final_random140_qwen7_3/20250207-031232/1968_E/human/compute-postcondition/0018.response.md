Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state is given as `i` is 8, and `n` must be at least 9.
2. The code snippet contains the `print(i, i)` statement.
3. Since `i` is explicitly stated to be 8, we use this value directly in the print statement.
4. The print statement will output the value of `i` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **8 8**
