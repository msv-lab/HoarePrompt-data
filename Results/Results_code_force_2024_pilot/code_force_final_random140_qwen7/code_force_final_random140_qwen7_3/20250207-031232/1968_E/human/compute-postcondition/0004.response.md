Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(3, n + 2)`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(3, n + 2):` will start when `i` is in the range from 3 to `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 3 (since the smallest value `i` can take is 3).

3. **Adjust the given states**:
   - We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\). This information about `t` is not directly relevant to the loop execution, so we do not need to adjust it.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, we adjust `n` to be greater than or equal to 3.
   - The variable `i` will start at 3 in the first iteration of the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3**
