Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `i` will be equal to 3, and `j` will be 8.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will still be within the range of 2 to 50 (since it cannot be reduced to 1 or less). The variable `i` will be set to 3 because the loop runs from `i` in `range(t)`, and since `t` is at least 2, running through the loop three times sets `i` to 2, and one more iteration sets it to 3. The variable `j` remains at 8 because the inner loop for `j` does not run if `n` is 3, and even if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the loop increments `j` up to `n`, but the last value of `j` printed is always 8 when the loop completes three iterations.
