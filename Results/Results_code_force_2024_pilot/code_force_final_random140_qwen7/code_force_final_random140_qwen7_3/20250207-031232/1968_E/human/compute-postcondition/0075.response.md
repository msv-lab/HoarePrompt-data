Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each test case, it prints \( n \) twice, followed by \( n-1 \), and then either 2 and 1 if \( n \) is 3, or a sequence of integers from 1 to \( n-2 \) printed twice. After processing all test cases, it ensures that \( t \) is set to 0 and \( n \) is an integer at least 3, with \( n \) being 3 if the condition is met.**
