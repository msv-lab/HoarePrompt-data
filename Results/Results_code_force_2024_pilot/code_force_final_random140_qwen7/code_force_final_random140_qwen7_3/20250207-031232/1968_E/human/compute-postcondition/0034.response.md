Output: **7, 7**

Explanation: 
- The initial state tells us that `i` is 7.
- The value of `n` is not explicitly needed to determine what is printed, as the print statement only references `i` twice.
- Therefore, when the print statement `print(i, i)` executes, it will print the value of `i` twice, which is 7.
