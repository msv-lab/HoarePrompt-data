The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 10.

The `print('1 2')` statement simply prints the string `'1 2'` to the console. Since no values for `n`, `t`, or any other variables are needed to execute this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **1 2**
