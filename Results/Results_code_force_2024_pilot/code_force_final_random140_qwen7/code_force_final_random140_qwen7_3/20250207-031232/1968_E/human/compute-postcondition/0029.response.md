Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(3, n + 2):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: According to the problem statement, the initial state is `i` is 11 and `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if the value of `i` falls within the range defined by `range(3, n + 2)`. This means `i` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than `n + 2`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is currently 11, it already satisfies the lower bound of the range (i.e., `i >= 3`).
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 11 because the upper bound of the range is `n + 2`, meaning `n + 2 > 11` or `n > 9`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 9 and `i` remains 11.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 11, `n` must be greater than 9**
