Output State: The value of `i` will be `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than 4.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will take the value of `n + 2`. This is because the loop starts from 3 (inclusive) and goes up to `n + 1` (inclusive), meaning it increments `i` until it reaches `n + 1`. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be `n + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to run at least 3 times, `n` must be greater than 4.
