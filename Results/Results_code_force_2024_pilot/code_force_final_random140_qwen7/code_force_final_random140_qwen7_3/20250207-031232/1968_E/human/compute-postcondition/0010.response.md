Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 8, `i` is 7.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 7 (since the loop increments `i` from 3 up to `n+1`, and if it runs 3 times, `n` must be at least 8 for the loop to complete). The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
