Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(3, n + 2):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n + 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 8
   - `n` must be at least 9

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 8, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 9.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 9.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 9
- `n` must be at least 9

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 9, `n` must be at least 9**
