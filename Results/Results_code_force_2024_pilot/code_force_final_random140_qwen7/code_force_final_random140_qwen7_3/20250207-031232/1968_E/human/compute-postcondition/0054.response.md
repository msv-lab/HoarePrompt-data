Output State: `t` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `j` by 1 each time it iterates, starting from 4 up to `n`. After 3 iterations, `j` is 5. Therefore, to complete all iterations, `n` must be at least 12 (since the loop will iterate until `j` reaches `n`, and we need `j` to reach 12). The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
