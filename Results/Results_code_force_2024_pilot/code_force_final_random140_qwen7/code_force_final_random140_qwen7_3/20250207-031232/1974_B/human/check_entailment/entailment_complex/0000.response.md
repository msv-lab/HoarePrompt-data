Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to decode a string based on the encoding algorithm described.
3. The function first creates a string `r` containing all unique characters from the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
4. It then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its corresponding character from the end of `r`.
5. Finally, it uses this map to decode the `encoded` string by replacing each character with its mapped value.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function `func_1` correctly implements the decoding process as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
