Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`. However, there is a logical error in the mapping process within the `func_1` function. Specifically, the mapping is created such that each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character from the end of `r`. This approach works correctly for most cases but fails when the length of the encoded string `b` is odd.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  ttf
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  fft
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  fff
  ```

The issue arises because the mapping dictionary `char_map` is created without considering the middle character in the case of an odd-length string. For the string `"ttf"`, the correct mapping should be:
- `t` -> `f`
- `t` -> `f`
- `f` -> `t`

However, the current implementation maps the middle character incorrectly. To fix this, we need to ensure that the middle character in `r` is correctly paired with itself in the mapping. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    n = len(r)
    char_map = {char: r[n - 1 - i] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded
```

This corrected function ensures that the middle character (if present) is correctly mapped to itself, thus fixing the issue for strings of odd length.
