Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`; `r` is a string that is the concatenation of all elements in `unique_chars`; `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each character in `r` to its corresponding character from the end of `r`.**

Explanation: The code creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the string `r` (which is the concatenation of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`) is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of `r`. For example, if `r` is "abc", then `char_map` would be {'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}.
