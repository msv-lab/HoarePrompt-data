The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` as input. It prints the value of `m` prefixed with '!', reads an integer input from the user, and assigns it to `ret`. If `m` is provided, the function waits for user input. The function does not modify `m` and returns the user-provided integer `ret`. If `m` is not provided (which is not a concern based on the given code), the function would wait for user input.
