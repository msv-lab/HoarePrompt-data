The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `l` and `x`, where `l` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, and `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. It prints these values to the standard output, flushes the buffer, reads an integer input from the standard input, and returns this integer.
