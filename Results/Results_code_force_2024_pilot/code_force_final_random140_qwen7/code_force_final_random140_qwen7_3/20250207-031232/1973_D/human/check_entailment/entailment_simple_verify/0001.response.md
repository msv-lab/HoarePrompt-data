### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.

#### Function `func_1(l, x)`
- This function prints a query asking for the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`.
- It reads the response from the judge and returns the value of `r`.
- The function is implemented correctly and handles the query format and input validation.

#### Function `func_2(m)`
- This function prints the final answer `m` and expects the judge to confirm if the answer is correct.
- If the judge confirms, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
- The function is implemented correctly and handles the confirmation process.

#### Function `func_3()`
- This function is the main logic for solving the problem.
- **Step 1**: It reads the input values `n` and `k`.
- **Step 2**: It tries to find the maximum value `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`. This helps in setting up the initial maximum value for further calculations.
  - The loop iterates from `n` down to `1`, checking if `func_1(1, i * n)` returns `n`. If it does, `max_val` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.
  - However, the loop starts from `n` and goes down to `1`, meaning it will only check the highest possible value of `i` once. This might miss some valid values if `i` is smaller than `n` but still satisfies the condition.
- **Step 3**: It then iterates over possible values of `m` (which is `i * max_val`) and checks if it can split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray satisfies `f(l, r) = m`.
  - The inner loop iterates `k` times, calling `func_1` to check the subarray.
  - If the entire array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required property, it calls `func_2(m)` to submit the answer.
  - If no such `m` is found, it calls `func_2(-1)` to indicate that no valid split exists.
- **Step 4**: The function correctly handles the termination and flushing of the output.

#### Function `func_4()`
- This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_3()` for each test case.
- It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the queries by printing the appropriate format and flushing the output.
   - It also checks for invalid responses and terminates appropriately.

2. **Finding Initial Maximum Value**:
   - The program attempts to find the initial maximum value `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`. This is a crucial step to set up the initial conditions for further calculations.
   - However, the loop starts from `n` and goes down to `1`, which might miss some valid values if `i` is smaller than `n` but still satisfies the condition.

3. **Splitting the Array**:
   - The program correctly iterates over possible values of `m` and checks if it can split the array into `k` subarrays with the required properties.
   - It uses the `func_1` function to check the validity of each subarray and ensures that the entire array is covered.

4. **Submitting the Answer**:
   - The program correctly submits the answer using `func_2` and handles both valid and invalid splits appropriately.

### Conclusion

The program has a logical flaw in the way it finds the initial maximum value `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`. The loop starts from `n` and goes down to `1`, which might miss some valid values if `i` is smaller than `n` but still satisfies the condition. This could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
