Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(l, x)`**:
   - This function prints a query asking for the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`.
   - It reads the response from the judge and returns the value of `r`.

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**:
   - This function prints the final answer `m` and expects the judge to confirm if the answer is correct.
   - If the judge confirms, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - This function is the main logic for solving the problem.
   - It first reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It tries to find the maximum value `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`. This helps in setting up the initial maximum value for further calculations.
   - It then iterates over possible values of `m` (which is `i * max_val`) and checks if it can split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray satisfies `f(l, r) = m`.
   - If it finds such an `m`, it calls `func_2(m)` to submit the answer.
   - If no such `m` is found, it calls `func_2(-1)` to indicate that no valid split exists.

4. **Function `func_4()`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_3()` for each test case.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the queries by printing the appropriate format and flushing the output.
   - It also checks for invalid responses and terminates appropriately.

2. **Finding Initial Maximum Value**:
   - The program attempts to find the initial maximum value `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`. This is a crucial step to set up the initial conditions for further calculations.

3. **Splitting the Array**:
   - The program correctly iterates over possible values of `m` and checks if it can split the array into `k` subarrays with the required properties.
   - It uses the `func_1` function to check the validity of each subarray and ensures that the entire array is covered.

4. **Submitting the Answer**:
   - The program correctly submits the answer using `func_2` and handles both valid and invalid splits appropriately.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program appears to correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem statement. It handles all aspects of querying, finding the initial maximum value, splitting the array, and submitting the answer.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
