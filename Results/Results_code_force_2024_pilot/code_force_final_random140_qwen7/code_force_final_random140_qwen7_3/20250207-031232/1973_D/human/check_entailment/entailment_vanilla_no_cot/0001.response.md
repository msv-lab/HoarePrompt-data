Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value `mx`**:
   - The program initializes `mx` to 1.
   - It enters a loop where it prints a query `? 1 {n * mx}` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = n * mx`.
   - If the returned `r` is `n`, it breaks the loop, indicating that `n * mx` is indeed the maximum value `mx` can take for the current test case.
   - Otherwise, it increments `mx` and continues the loop.

3. **Calculating the Target Value `tar`**:
   - The target value `tar` is calculated as `n // k * mx`.

4. **Checking for Valid Subarrays**:
   - The program enters a loop where it decrements `tar` by `mx` until a valid `tar` is found.
   - For each potential `tar`, it calls the function `func_1(tar, k, n)` to check if it can split the array into `k` subarrays such that each subarray has a product of its length and maximum value equal to `tar`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the loop breaks, and the program prints the result `! {tar}`.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if it can split the array into `k` subarrays with the given `tar`.
   - It iterates through the array, using the query `? {ind + 1} {tar}` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(ind + 1, r) = tar`.
   - If the returned `r` is `n + 1`, it means no such subarray exists, and the function returns `False`.
   - If it successfully finds `k` subarrays, it returns `True`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Finding `mx`**:
   - The logic to find `mx` seems correct. It ensures that `mx` is the maximum value such that `f(1, r) = n * mx` for some `r`.

2. **Calculating `tar`**:
   - The calculation of `tar` as `n // k * mx` is correct based on the problem statement.

3. **Checking for Valid Subarrays**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly checks if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required properties.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no valid `tar` is found by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly finds the maximum value `mx`, calculates the target value `tar`, and checks if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required properties.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
