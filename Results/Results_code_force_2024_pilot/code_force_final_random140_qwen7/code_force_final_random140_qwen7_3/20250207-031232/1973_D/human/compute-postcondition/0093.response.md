Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `0` because the loop starts from `n // k` and decrements `i` by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `1`, and then continues decrementing until it becomes `0`. The variable `m` will be `(n // k - 1) * max_val` because `m` is updated in each iteration of the outer loop, and since `i` starts from `n // k` and decreases to `1`, `m` will be updated `n // k - 1` times. The variable `p` will be the result of applying `func_1` exactly `k * (n // k - 1)` times starting from `1` with the updated `m` value, and `p` will not equal `n` unless the loop prematurely returns due to `p >= n` condition being met, but based on the given information, we assume it does not reach `n`. The variable `max_val` will be the largest value of `i` such that `r` (the result of `func_1(1, (n-1)*n)`) is less than or equal to `n` during any iteration, which would be `n // k` since the loop starts from `n // k` and decrements until `0`.
