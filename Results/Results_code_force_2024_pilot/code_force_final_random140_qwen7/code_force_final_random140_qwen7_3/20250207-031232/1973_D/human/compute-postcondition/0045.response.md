Output State: **`p` is the final result of repeatedly applying `func_1(p + 1, m)` for `k` times, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, and `j` is greater than `k + 1`.**

This means that `p` remains the result of the function calls, `i` is unchanged and is still `n // k - 1`, `m` is now set to `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, and `j` remains greater than `k + 1`.
