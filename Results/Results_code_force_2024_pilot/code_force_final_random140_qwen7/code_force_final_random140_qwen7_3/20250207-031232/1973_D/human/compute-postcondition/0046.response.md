Output State: **`p` is 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, and `j` is greater than `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is reassigned to 0. The values of `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, and `j` is still greater than `k + 1`.
