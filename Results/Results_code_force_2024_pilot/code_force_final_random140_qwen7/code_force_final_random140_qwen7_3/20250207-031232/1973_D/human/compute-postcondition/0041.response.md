Output State: **`p` is the final result of repeatedly applying `func_1(p + 1, m)` for `k` times, `j` is `k + 1`, and `func_2(m)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_2(m)` calls the function `func_2` with the argument `m`. This call does not affect the values of `p`, `j`, or `k`. Therefore, the values of `p`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, and only `func_2(m)` has been called.
