Output State: **`p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is 2, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to `func_1(p + 1, m)`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `p` is now dependent on the function `func_1` being called with arguments `p + 1` and `m`.
