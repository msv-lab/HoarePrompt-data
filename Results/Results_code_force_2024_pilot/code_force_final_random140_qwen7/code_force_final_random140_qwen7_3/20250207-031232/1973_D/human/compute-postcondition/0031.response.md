Output State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `p`, `j`, or `k`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. The initial conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
