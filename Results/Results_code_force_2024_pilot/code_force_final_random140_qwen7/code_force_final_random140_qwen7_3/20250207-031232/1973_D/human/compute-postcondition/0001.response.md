State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the range parameter.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, it must be greater than 0 for the loop to run at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` must be greater than 0.
