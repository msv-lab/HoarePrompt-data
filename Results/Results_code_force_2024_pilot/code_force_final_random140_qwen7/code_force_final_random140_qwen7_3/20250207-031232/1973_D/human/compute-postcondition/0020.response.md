Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`, and the decrement step `-1`. The variable `k` is also present in the range function but is not directly involved in the loop head.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop runs from `n // k` down to `1` (inclusive).
   - The variable `i` is initialized to `n // k` and decremented by `1` each iteration.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that `i` is set to `1` after all iterations.

3. **Determine the Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `i` is `1`.
   - `n` remains the initial input integer.
   - `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1)*n)`, assuming `i` was `1` at some point.
   - `max_val` is set to the largest `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `n` during any iteration of the loop. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains `0`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` must be `1` after all iterations.
   - `n` must remain the initial input integer.
   - `r` must be the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1)*n)`.
   - `max_val` must be the largest `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `n` during any iteration, or `0` if no such `i` exists.

Based on this analysis, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the initial input integer, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1)*n)`, `max_val` is the largest `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `n` during any iteration of the loop, or `0` if no such `i` exists**.
