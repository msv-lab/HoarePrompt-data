Output State: **`p` is `func_1(func_1(... func_1((n // k - 1) * max_val + 1, m), m), ..., m)` applied `k` times, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is `k + 1`, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, `func_2(m)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_2(m)` is executed, which means `func_2` is called with the argument `m`. The values of `p`, `i`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state. The function `func_2` is called with the value of `m`, but no further details about its return value or changes are provided in the given information.
