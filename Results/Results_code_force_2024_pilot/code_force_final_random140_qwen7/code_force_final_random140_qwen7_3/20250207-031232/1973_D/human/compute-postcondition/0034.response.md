Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the condition `range(1, k + 1)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`
   - `j` is incremented by 1 (let's assume it was `j - 1` before the increment)
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be the previous value of `j` plus 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- The value of `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The value of `k` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- The value of `p` remains unchanged because the function call `func_1(p + 1, m)` does not depend on the loop iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`**.
