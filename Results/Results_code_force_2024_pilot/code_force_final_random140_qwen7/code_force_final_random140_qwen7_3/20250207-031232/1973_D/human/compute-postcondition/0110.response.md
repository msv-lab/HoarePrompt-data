Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `p` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be `0`, `m` will be `0`, `k` will be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` will have executed a total of `k * (n // k - 1)` times.**

Explanation: Given the loop conditions and the described behavior, the loop continues to decrement `i` from `n // k` down to `1`. For each value of `i`, it calculates `m` as `i * max_val` and then iterates through `j` from `1` to `k`. Inside the inner loop, `p` is incremented using `func_1`. The loop breaks when `p` reaches or exceeds `n`. Since the problem states that `p` is not equal to `n` after the first three iterations, and considering the structure of the loop, `p` will eventually reach `n` when `i` reaches `0`, meaning the outer loop completes all its iterations. At this point, `i` becomes `0`, `m` becomes `0` (since `m` is always `i * max_val`), and `p` finally equals `n` because the loop condition `p == n` triggers the `func_2(m)` call and returns, indicating that `p` has reached `n`.
