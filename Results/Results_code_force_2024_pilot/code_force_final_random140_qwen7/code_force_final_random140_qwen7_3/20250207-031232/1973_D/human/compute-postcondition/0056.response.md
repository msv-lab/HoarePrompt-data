Postcondition: `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and `m` remains unchanged. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the value of `j` and the state of the loops remain as they are if the condition `p >= n` is not met.
