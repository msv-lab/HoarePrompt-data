Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `p` is `func_1(func_1(1 + m) + 1, m)`
- `i` is `n // k - 2`
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `j` is `k + 1`

### Loop Head:
```
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `j`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `k + 1`.

### Current State:
- `j` is currently `k + 1`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from `k + 1` to `k + 2`.
- Therefore, `j` will become `k + 2`.

### Adjusted States:
- `p` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `i` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `m` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `k` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `j` changes from `k + 1` to `k + 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`p` is `func_1(func_1(1 + m) + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 2`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 2`**
