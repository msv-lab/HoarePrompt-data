Output State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and `m` remains unchanged, `j` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` updates the value of `p` to the result of the function call `func_1(p + 1, m)`. Since `m` remains unchanged and `j` is not affected by this operation, the output state includes the updated value of `p` and the unchanged values of `m` and `j`.
