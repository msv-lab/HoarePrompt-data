Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the initial input integer, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1)*n)`, `max_val` is the largest `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `n` during any iteration of the loop, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `m` is `i * max_val` which simplifies to `1 * max_val` or just `max_val`; `p` is 0.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `p`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the value of `p` is updated to `0`, while the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, `max_val`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
