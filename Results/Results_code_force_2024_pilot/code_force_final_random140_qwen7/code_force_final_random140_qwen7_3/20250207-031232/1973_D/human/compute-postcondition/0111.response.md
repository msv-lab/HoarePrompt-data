Output State: **`p` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `m` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` has executed a total of `k * (n // k - 1)` times.**

Explanation: The function `func_2(-1)` is called, but since the function definition is not provided, no changes are made to the variables `p`, `i`, `m`, `k`, or `j`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
