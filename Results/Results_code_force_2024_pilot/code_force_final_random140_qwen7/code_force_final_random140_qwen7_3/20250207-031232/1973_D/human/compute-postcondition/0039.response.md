Output State: **`p` is the final result of repeatedly applying `func_1(p + 1, m)` for `k` times, `j` is `k + 1`, and `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed. If at any point `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`, the loop breaks early and `j` will be less than `k + 1`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations (or possibly broken early), `p` will hold the value obtained by successively applying the function `func_1` starting from `p + 1` and using `m` as the second argument, for a total of `k` times. The variable `j` will reflect the number of times the loop actually ran (or the point at which it broke, if `p` reached `n` before completing all iterations). The variable `k` represents the intended number of iterations the loop was supposed to run.
