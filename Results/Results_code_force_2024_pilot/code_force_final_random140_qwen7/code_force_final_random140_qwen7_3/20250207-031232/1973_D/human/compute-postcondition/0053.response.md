Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`
   - `m` remains unchanged
   - If the current value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement
   - If the condition `p >= n` is false, no change occurs

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, k + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `j` ranges from `1` to `k + 1`.
   - The loop does not directly modify `p` or `m`.

4. **Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < k + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop variable `j` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `j` is incremented from its previous value.
   - The value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `j + 1`.

6. **Post-Condition Analysis:**
   - The postcondition `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and `m` remains unchanged.
   - The condition `p >= n` determines whether the loop breaks.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should include the updated value of `j`.

**State:**
**`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `m` remains unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `m` remains unchanged, and `j` is 2 (assuming `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration)**

If `j` was not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we assume it starts from 1. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `m` remains unchanged, and `j` is 2**
