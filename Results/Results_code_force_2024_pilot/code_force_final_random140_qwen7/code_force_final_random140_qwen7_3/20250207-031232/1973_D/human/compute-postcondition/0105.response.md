Output State: `p` is `func_1(func_1(1 + m) + 1, m) + (k - 2)`, `i` is `n // k - 2`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + (k - 2)`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `p` will be the result of applying the function `func_1` repeatedly `(k - 2)` times starting from `1 + m`. The variable `i` remains as `n // k - 2`, `m` remains as `i * max_val`, `k` remains greater than or equal to 1, and `j` will be `k + (k - 2)` since `j` increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
