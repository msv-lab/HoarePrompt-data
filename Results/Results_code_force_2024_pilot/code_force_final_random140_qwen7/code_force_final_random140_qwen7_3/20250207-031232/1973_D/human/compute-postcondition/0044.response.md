Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `p` is the final result of repeatedly applying `func_1(p + 1, m)` for `k` times.
- `j` is greater than `k + 1`.
- `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves three variables: `i`, `n`, and `k`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0. The value of `i` starts from `n // k` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` starts from `n // k`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

2. **After One Iteration**:
   - `i` will be decreased by 1, so `i` becomes `(n // k) - 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

3. **General Case**:
   - After `x` iterations, `i` will be `(n // k) - x`.

### Final State Before Next Iteration:
- `i` will be `(n // k) - 1` (since we are considering the start of the next iteration).
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.

### Updated State:
State: **`p` is the final result of repeatedly applying `func_1(p + 1, m)` for `k` times, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is greater than `k + 1`, and `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`p` is the final result of repeatedly applying `func_1(p + 1, m)` for `k` times, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is greater than `k + 1`, and `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed.**
