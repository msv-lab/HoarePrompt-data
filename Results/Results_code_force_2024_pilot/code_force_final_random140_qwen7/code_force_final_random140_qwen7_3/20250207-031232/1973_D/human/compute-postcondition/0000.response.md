Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, after executing this line of code, `t` will be updated to the integer value provided by the input. All other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `t` represents the number of test cases is maintained.
