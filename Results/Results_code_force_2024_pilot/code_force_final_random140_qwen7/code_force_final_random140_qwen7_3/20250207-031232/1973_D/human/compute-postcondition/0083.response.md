Output State: **`p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)` where `p` was previously `func_1(func_1(p + 1, m) + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is 3, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`**

Explanation: The variable `p` is reassigned to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. Since `p` was previously defined as `func_1(func_1(p + 1, m) + 1, m)`, after the reassignment, `p` now holds the value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
