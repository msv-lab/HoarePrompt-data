Output State: **`p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is 2, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `p`, `i`, `j`, and `m`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
