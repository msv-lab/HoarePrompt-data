Output State: **`p` is the result of applying `func_1` three times starting from `p + 1` with `m` remaining unchanged, `i` is decremented by 1 after each iteration of the outer loop, `j` is `k + 1`, and `m` remains `(n // k - 1) * max_val`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `p` will have been updated three times using the `func_1` function, starting from `p + 1`. The variable `i` will have been decremented by one for each iteration of the loop, so it will be `n // k - 1 - 3`. The variable `j` will be equal to `k + 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `k`, and after three iterations, `j` will be `3`, which is `k + 1` if `k == 2`. The variable `m` remains unchanged at `(n // k - 1) * max_val`.
