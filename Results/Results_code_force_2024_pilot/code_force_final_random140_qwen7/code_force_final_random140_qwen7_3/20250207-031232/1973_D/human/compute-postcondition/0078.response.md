Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, k + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `p` is `func_1(1 + (n // k - 1) * max_val, m)`
   - `i` is `n // k - 1`
   - `j` is 1
   - `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range specified by `range(1, k + 1)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each time through the loop.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Other variables remain unchanged**: Since the loop does not directly modify `p`, `i`, or `m`, these variables will retain their values from the previous iteration.

6. **Postcondition consideration**: The postcondition mentioned (`if p >= n, break`) does not affect the initial state of the loop but rather the continuation of the loop based on the value of `p`.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`p` is `func_1(1 + (n // k - 1) * max_val, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is 2, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`**
