Output State: **`p` is `func_1(1 + (n // k - 1) * max_val, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is 1, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `p`, `i`, `j`, or `m`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no new values are assigned to these variables, their states remain as they were before the `break` statement.
