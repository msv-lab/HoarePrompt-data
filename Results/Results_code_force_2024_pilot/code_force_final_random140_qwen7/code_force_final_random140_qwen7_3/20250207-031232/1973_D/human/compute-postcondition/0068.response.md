Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is in the range `n // k` to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 after each iteration.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p` is the result of applying `func_1` three times starting from `p + 1` with `m` remaining unchanged.
   - `i` is decremented by 1 after each iteration of the outer loop.
   - `j` is `k + 1`.
   - `m` remains `(n // k - 1) * max_val`.
   - `p` is not equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is decremented by 1 after each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be in the range `n // k` to `1` (inclusive). Therefore, `i` must be `n // k - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `k` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `p` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` is now `n // k - 1`.
   - `j` is `k + 1` and remains unchanged.
   - `m` remains `(n // k - 1) * max_val` since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `p` is still not equal to `n`.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`p` is the result of applying `func_1` three times starting from `p + 1` with `m` remaining unchanged, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is `k + 1`, and `m` remains `(n // k - 1) * max_val`. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.**
