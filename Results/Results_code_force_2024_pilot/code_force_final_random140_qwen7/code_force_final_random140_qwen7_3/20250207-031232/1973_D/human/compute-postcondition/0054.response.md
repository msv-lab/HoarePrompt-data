Output State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and `m` remains unchanged, `j` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` updates the value of `p` to be the result of the function call `func_1(p + 1, m)`. Since `m` remains unchanged and `j` is 2, these values stay the same. The new value of `p` depends on the function `func_1`, but the exact value is not specified, so we keep it in terms of the function call.
