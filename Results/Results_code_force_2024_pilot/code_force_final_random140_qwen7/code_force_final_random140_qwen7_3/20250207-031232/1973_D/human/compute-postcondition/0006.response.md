Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_3()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignments or operations that affect `t` are shown), the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the only information we can provide about the state of the variables is that `t` must still be greater than 0.
