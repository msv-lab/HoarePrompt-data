Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, i * n)`.
   - If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `max_val` is `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `r` is greater than `n`, no additional changes occur.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `n - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `n - 2`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `r` remains unchanged unless the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, but since no such action is mentioned, `r` stays the same.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `n - 2`.
   - `n` and `r` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n - 2) * n)`**.
