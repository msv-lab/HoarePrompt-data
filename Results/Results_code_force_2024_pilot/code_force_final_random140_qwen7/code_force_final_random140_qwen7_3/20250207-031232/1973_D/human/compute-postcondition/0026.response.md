Output State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, and the current value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `p` and `n`, nor does it call any functions. It simply exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the only information that remains valid is the initial state of `p` and `n`, along with the fact that we have broken out of the loop or conditional block.
