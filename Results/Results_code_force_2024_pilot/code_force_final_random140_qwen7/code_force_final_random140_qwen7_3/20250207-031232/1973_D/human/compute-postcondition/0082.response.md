Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(1, k + 1):`. The variables involved here are `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range specified in the loop head, which is from 1 to `k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state of `j`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value of 2. Therefore, `j` will become 3.

5. **Check if other variables need adjustment**: The variables `p`, `i`, `m`, and `k` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change within the loop itself. They remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is 3, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`**
