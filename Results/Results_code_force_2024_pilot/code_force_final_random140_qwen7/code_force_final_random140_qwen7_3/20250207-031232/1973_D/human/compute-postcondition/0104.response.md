Output State: `p` is `func_1(func_1(1 + m) + 1, m) + (k - 2)`, `i` is `n // k - 2`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + (k - 2)`, and `p` is less than `n`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = k`. Given that the loop executes `k - 2` times based on the provided output states, it means the loop body is executed `k - 2` times. Each iteration increments `p` by `func_1(p + 1, m)`. Therefore, after `k - 2` iterations, `p` will be incremented by `func_1(1 + m) + 1` a total of `k - 2` times. The final value of `p` will be `func_1(func_1(1 + m) + 1, m) + (k - 2)`. The variable `j` will be `k + (k - 2)` after the loop completes. All other variables (`i`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
