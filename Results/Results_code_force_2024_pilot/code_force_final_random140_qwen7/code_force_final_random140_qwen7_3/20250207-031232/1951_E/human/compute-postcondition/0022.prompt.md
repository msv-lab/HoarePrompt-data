You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
def func_2(ch):
    b = len(ch) // 2
    if (len(ch) % 2 == 0) :
        if func_1(ch[:b]) :
            a = 3
        else :
            a = 4
        #State: Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is the integer value of half the length of `ch`, and the length of `ch` is even. If `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, then `a` is 3. Otherwise, `a` is 4.
    else :
        if func_1(ch[:b]) :
            a = 1
        else :
            a = 2
        #State: Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is the integer value of half the length of `ch`, and the length of `ch` is odd. If `func_1(ch[:b])` evaluates to True, then `a` is set to 1. Otherwise, `a` is set to 2.
    #State: Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is the integer value of half the length of `ch`. If the length of `ch` is even, then:
    #- If `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, `a` is 3.
    #- Otherwise, `a` is 4.
    #
    #If the length of `ch` is odd, then:
    #- If `func_1(ch[:b])` evaluates to True, `a` is set to 1.
    #- Otherwise, `a` is set to 2.
    return a
    #The program returns either 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the evaluation of `func_1(ch[:b])` and the length of `ch`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `ch`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters. It returns either 1, 2, 3, or 4 based on the evaluation of `func_1(ch[:b])` and the length of `ch`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns either 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the evaluation of `func_1(ch[:b])` and the length of `ch`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
