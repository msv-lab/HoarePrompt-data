Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is the integer value of half the length of `ch`. If the length of `ch` is even, then `a` is 3 if `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, and `a` is 4 otherwise. If the length of `ch` is odd, then `a` is 1 if `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, and `a` is 2 otherwise.
