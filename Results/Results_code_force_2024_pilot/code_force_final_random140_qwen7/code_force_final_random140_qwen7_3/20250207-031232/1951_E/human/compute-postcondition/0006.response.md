Output State: **`ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is the integer value of half the length of `ch`, and the length of `ch` is even, `func_1(ch[:b])` returns False, `a` is 4.**

The code simply assigns the integer value 4 to the variable `a`. Since the initial state of `ch`, `b`, and the function call `func_1(ch[:b])` are unchanged, they remain as described in the initial state.
