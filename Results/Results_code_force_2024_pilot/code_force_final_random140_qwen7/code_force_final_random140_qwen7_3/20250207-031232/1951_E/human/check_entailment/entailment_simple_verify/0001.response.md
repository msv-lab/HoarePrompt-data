### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
- It correctly splits the string into two halves and checks if they are equal when reversed, considering the middle character if the length is odd.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function is intended to determine how many non-palindromic substrings a string can be split into.
- The logic in `func_2` is indeed flawed as pointed out in the original assessment. Here are the specific issues:
  - If the string length is even and the first half is a palindrome, it incorrectly returns `3`.
  - If the string length is even and the first half is not a palindrome, it incorrectly returns `4`.
  - If the string length is odd and the first half is a palindrome, it incorrectly returns `1`.
  - If the string length is odd and the first half is not a palindrome, it incorrectly returns `2`.

#### Detailed Issues with `func_2`:
- The function does not consider the entire string's structure and only checks the first half.
- It does not ensure that the entire string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1**: `sinktheyacht`
   - Expected output: `YES 1 sinktheyacht`
   - Actual output: `NO` (due to incorrect logic in `func_2`)
   
2. **Test Case 2**: `lllllllll`
   - Expected output: `NO`
   - Actual output: `NO` (correct, but due to incorrect logic in `func_2`)
   
3. **Test Case 3**: `uwuowouwu`
   - Expected output: `YES 3 uw uow ouwu`
   - Actual output: `NO` (due to incorrect logic in `func_2`)

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. The original assessment is accurate in pointing out the flaws in `func_2`.

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect.
