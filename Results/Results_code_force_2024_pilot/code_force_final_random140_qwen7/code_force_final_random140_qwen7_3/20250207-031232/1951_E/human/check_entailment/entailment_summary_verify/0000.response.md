### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The task is to partition a string into substrings such that no substring is a palindrome.
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem. They check if a string is a palindrome, which is not what the problem requires.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing the first half with the reversed second half.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to determine if the first half of the string is a palindrome and returns an integer based on the length and the result of `func_1`.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the input "sinktheyacht":
     - Expected output:
       ```
       YES
       1
       sinktheyacht
       ```
     - Running the provided functions on "sinktheyacht" will not produce the correct result because the functions do not provide a mechanism to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly states that the provided code does not implement the required functionality. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem and do not solve the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required functionality of partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings.
