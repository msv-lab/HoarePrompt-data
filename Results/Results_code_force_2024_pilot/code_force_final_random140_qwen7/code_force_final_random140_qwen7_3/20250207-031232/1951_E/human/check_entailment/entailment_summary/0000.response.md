Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires partitioning a string into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes. The solution involves checking if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and then performing the partitioning.

2. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: Checks if the first half of the string (ignoring the middle character if the length is odd) is a palindrome.
   - **Function `func_2`**: Determines how many parts the string should be split into based on the result of `func_1` and the length of the string.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if the entire string is a palindrome (`T1`).
   - If the string is a single repeated character (`T1` is set to `False` if the string is equal to its first character repeated `len(s)` times).
   - If the string is not a single repeated character and not a palindrome, it uses `func_1` and `func_2` to determine the number of parts needed.
   - Based on the number of parts determined, it splits the string accordingly and prints the result.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the edge cases where the string is a single repeated character or a palindrome.
   - It uses `func_1` and `func_2` appropriately to determine the number of parts needed.
   - The splitting logic ensures that each part is not a palindrome.
   - The output format matches the required format.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings and handles all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
