### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Correctness**: 
  - The function `func_1` checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
  - It correctly splits the string into two halves and checks if they are equal when reversed.
  - If the length of `ch` is odd, it correctly handles the middle character separately.
  - This function works as intended.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Correctness**:
  - The function `func_2` is designed to determine how many non-palindromic substrings a string can be split into.
  - However, the logic in `func_2` is indeed flawed:
    - It checks the first half of the string using `func_1`.
    - Depending on whether the string length is even or odd, it returns a value without considering the entire string's structure.
    - Specifically, it does not ensure that the entire string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
    - As noted in the original assessment, the logic for returning values 1, 2, 3, and 4 is incorrect.

#### Main Program Logic:
- **Initial Checks**:
  - The program first checks if the string consists of repeated characters (e.g., `lllllllll`). If so, it immediately returns "NO".
  - These checks are correct and handle simple cases effectively.
  
- **Partitioning Logic**:
  - The main logic uses `func_2` to determine the number of non-palindromic substrings needed.
  - Based on the returned value from `func_2`, the program attempts to partition the string accordingly.
  - However, as noted in the original assessment, the logic in `func_2` is flawed, leading to incorrect partitioning decisions.

#### Detailed Issues with Partitioning Logic:
- **Incorrect Handling of Partitioning**:
  - The program attempts to partition the string based on the value returned by `func_2`.
  - For example, if `func_2` returns 1, the program incorrectly assumes the entire string is non-palindromic.
  - Similarly, for other values, the program makes incorrect assumptions about the partitioning.

#### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `sinktheyacht`
  - Expected output: `YES 1 sinktheyacht`
  - Actual output: `NO` (due to incorrect logic in `func_2`)
- **Test Case 2**: `lllllllll`
  - Expected output: `NO`
  - Actual output: `NO` (correct, but due to incorrect logic in `func_2`)
- **Test Case 3**: `uwuowouwu`
  - Expected output: `YES 3 uw uow ouwu`
  - Actual output: `NO` (due to incorrect logic in `func_2`)

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. The main logic relies on `func_2` to make partitioning decisions, which are fundamentally flawed.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect.
