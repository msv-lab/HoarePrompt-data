### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - It initializes flags and variables appropriately.

2. **Palindrome Check Function (`func_1`):**
   - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - The logic is correct: it splits the string into two halves and checks if they are mirror images of each other.
   - However, the function should only return `True` if the entire string is a palindrome, not just a part of it.

3. **Partition Function (`func_2`):**
   - This function determines how many parts the string can be split into without forming any palindromic substrings.
   - The logic is flawed because:
     - It incorrectly uses `func_1` to decide the number of parts.
     - It doesn't handle all edge cases properly, especially when the string length is small.
     - It doesn't ensure that the resulting substrings are not palindromes.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It uses `func_1` and `func_2` to make decisions about the partitioning.
   - There are several issues:
     - The conditions for `T1` and `T2` are not correctly implemented.
     - The partitioning logic is overly complex and doesn't guarantee non-palindromic substrings.
     - The handling of edge cases (e.g., single-character strings) is inadequate.

5. **Output Handling:**
   - The output format is mostly correct, but the logic to generate the partitions is flawed.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because:
- The `func_1` function does not correctly check for palindromes.
- The `func_2` function has logical flaws and does not ensure that the resulting substrings are non-palindromic.
- The main logic does not correctly handle all test cases, especially edge cases.

### Correctness:

**False**
