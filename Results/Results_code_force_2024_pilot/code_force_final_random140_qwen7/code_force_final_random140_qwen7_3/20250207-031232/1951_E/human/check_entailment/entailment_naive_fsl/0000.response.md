Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem statement. The problem requires partitioning a string into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes. However, the given functions are checking if a string is a palindrome, which is not what the problem requires.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
sinktheyacht
```

Expected output:
```
YES
1
sinktheyacht
```

However, running the provided functions on the string "sinktheyacht" will not produce the correct result. The functions do not provide any mechanism to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

Since the provided code does not implement the required functionality, it is incorrect.
