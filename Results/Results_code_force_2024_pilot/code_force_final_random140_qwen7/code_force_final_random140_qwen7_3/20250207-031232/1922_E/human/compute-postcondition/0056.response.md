Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer - 1, `min` is -999999, `ans` is the string '-100000000 '**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, making it `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still 0, `x` is now one less than its original value, `min` remains -999999, and `ans` stays as the string '-100000000'.
