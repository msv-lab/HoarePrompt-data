The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `x` must be different from 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be something other than 1.

State: **`t` is 1, `x` must be different from 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 ' or '-100000000', depending on whether `x` is even or not**
