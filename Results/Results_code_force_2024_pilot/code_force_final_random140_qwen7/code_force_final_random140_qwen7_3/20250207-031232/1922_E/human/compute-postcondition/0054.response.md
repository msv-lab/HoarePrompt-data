Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 1, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is the string '-100000000 '**

Explanation: The code updates the `ans` variable by concatenating the string representation of `min` (which is -100000000) with a space and the current value of `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, after the operation, `ans` becomes '-100000000 '. The values of `t`, `x`, and `min` remain unchanged.
