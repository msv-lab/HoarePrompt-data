`x` is decremented by 1. The value of `min` can be either -99999998 or -100000001, `ans` is constructed from concatenating ' ', `min`, ' ', and `ans`, `i` can be either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` can be either 99999999 or 100000000, `t` is 1, and `x` is not 1. After decrementing `x` by 1, the value of `x` will be one less than its original value.

Output State: **`min` is either -99999998 or -100000001, `ans` is ' ' + `min` + ' ' + `ans`, `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `t` is 1, `x` is `original_x_value - 1`.**
