Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either half of its original value or 0 but not 1, `max` is 99999997 or 99999998, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a string equal to 'max' followed by a space and the original value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `max -= 1` decrements the value of `max` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `max` could be either 99999998 or 99999999. After decrementing, `max` would be 99999997 or 99999998, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
