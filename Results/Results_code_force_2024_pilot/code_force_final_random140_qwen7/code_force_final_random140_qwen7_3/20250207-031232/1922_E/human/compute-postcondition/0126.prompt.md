Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    max = 100000000
    min = -100000000
    ans = ''
    t = 0
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
            max -= 1
            x = x // 2
        else:
            ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
            min += 1
            x -= 1
        t += 1
    print(t)
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is equal to the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1 through the specified operations, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - `t`, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, and `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` and ending with `min`.

To understand this, consider that each iteration either halves `x` (if it's even) or decrements `x` (if it's odd). The loop continues until `x` becomes 1. During each iteration, `max` decreases or `min` increases, and these values are appended to `ans` in reverse order. Since `t` counts the number of iterations, `max` will be reduced by `t` and `min` will be increased by `t` from their initial values. The final state of `ans` will contain the sequence of `max` and `min` values encountered during the loop, starting with `max` and ending with `min`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is 1, `min` is -999999, `ans` is a string that contains a sequence of numbers starting from `max` and decreasing by 1 each time `x` is even, or starting from `-100000000` and increasing by 1 each time `x` is odd, concatenated in reverse order until `x` reaches 1.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the total count of iterations it took for `x` to become 1. The variable `x` will finally be 1 because the loop continues to modify `x` until it equals 1. The variable `min` remains -999999 as it is only incremented and never decremented once it reaches -999999. The variable `ans` will contain a series of numbers based on the operations performed during each iteration, starting from `max` or `-100000000` and decrementing/incrementing accordingly, and these numbers will be stored in reverse order in the string `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `min` is -1, `ans` is a string containing all the `min` and `max` values from each iteration with appropriate spacing, `i` is `input_value - 1`, `max` is 1, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `min` will be incremented to -1 because it starts at -100000000 and increments by 1 each time `x` is odd. The variable `max` will be decremented to 1 because it starts at 100000000 and decreases by 1 each time `x` is even. The variable `ans` will contain a concatenated string of all the `min` and `max` values from each iteration, formatted appropriately. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `t` will hold the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1. The variable `x` will eventually become 1, ending the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
