Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either 0.5 or `original_x_value - 1`, `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is a string containing `min` and `max` values with appropriate spacing, `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by 1, so `t` is now 2. The values of `x`, `min`, `ans`, `i`, and `max` remain unchanged from the initial state since no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
