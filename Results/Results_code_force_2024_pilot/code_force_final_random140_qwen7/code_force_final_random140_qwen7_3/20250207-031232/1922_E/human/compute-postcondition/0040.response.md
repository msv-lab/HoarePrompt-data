Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is 1.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1 through the specified operations.
   - `max` is 100000000 - `t`.
   - `min` is -100000000 + `t`.
   - `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` and ending with `min`.

2. **Operations**:
   - Each iteration either halves `x` (if it's even) or decrements `x` (if it's odd).
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 1.
   - During each iteration, `max` decreases or `min` increases, and these values are appended to `ans` in reverse order.

3. **Understanding `t`**:
   - Since `x` starts at 1 and the only way to reduce it to 1 is to keep halving it (because decrementing would never reach 1), `t` must be 0 because no iterations are needed to reduce `x` to 1.

4. **Calculating `max` and `min`**:
   - Given `t = 0`:
     - `max = 100000000 - t = 100000000 - 0 = 100000000`.
     - `min = -100000000 + t = -100000000 + 0 = -100000000`.

5. **Constructing `ans`**:
   - `ans` contains alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` and ending with `min`.
   - Since `t = 0`, there are no iterations, so `ans` will just be the initial values of `max` and `min` in the order they were defined.

6. **Printing `t`**:
   - The print statement `print(t)` will simply print the value of `t`.

Given this reasoning, the value of `t` is 0.

Output: **0**
