Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input non-negative integer less than `t`, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code `ans = ''` initializes the variable `ans` to an empty string. No other changes are made to the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged from their initial states.
