Output State: **`min` is 999999, `ans` is a string containing all the `min` and `max` values from each iteration with appropriate spacing, `i` is `input_value - 1`, `max` is 1, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `min` will be incremented to 999999 because it starts at -100000000 and increments by 1 each time `x` is odd. The variable `max` will be decremented to 1 because it starts at 100000000 and decreases by 1 each time `x` is even. The variable `ans` will contain a concatenated string of all the `min` and `max` values from each iteration, formatted appropriately. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `t` will hold the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1. The variable `x` will eventually become 1, ending the loop.
