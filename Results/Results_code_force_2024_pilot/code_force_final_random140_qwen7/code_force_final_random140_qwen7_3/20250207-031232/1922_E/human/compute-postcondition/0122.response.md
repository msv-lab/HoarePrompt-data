Output State: `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a string containing all the `min` and `max` values with appropriate spacing, `i` is `input_value - 1`, `max` is 100000000, `t` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, and `x` is 1.

To understand this output state, let's break down the process:

- The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to 1.
- In each iteration, if `x` is even, `max` decreases by 1 and `x` is halved. If `x` is odd, `min` increases by 1 and `x` decreases by 1.
- The variable `ans` accumulates the values of `min` and `max` with spaces between them.
- The variable `t` counts the number of iterations.
- Once `x` becomes 1, the loop stops.

Since the loop continues until `x` equals 1, and given the way `x` is modified (halving for even numbers and decrementing for odd numbers), eventually `x` will reach 1. At this point, `t` will be the total number of iterations performed.

The final state of `min` will be -100000000 because it starts at -100000000 and only increases when `x` is odd. The final state of `max` will be 100000000 because it starts at 100000000 and only decreases when `x` is even. The `ans` variable will contain all the intermediate values of `min` and `max` with appropriate spacing, and `i` will be `input_value - 1` because it starts at `input_value - 1` and is not changed within the loop.
