Output State: `t` is equal to the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1 through the specified operations, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - `t`, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, and `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` and ending with `min`.

To understand this, consider that each iteration either halves `x` (if it's even) or decrements `x` (if it's odd). The loop continues until `x` becomes 1. During each iteration, `max` decreases or `min` increases, and these values are appended to `ans` in reverse order. Since `t` counts the number of iterations, `max` will be reduced by `t` and `min` will be increased by `t` from their initial values. The final state of `ans` will contain the sequence of `max` and `min` values encountered during the loop, starting with `max` and ending with `min`.
