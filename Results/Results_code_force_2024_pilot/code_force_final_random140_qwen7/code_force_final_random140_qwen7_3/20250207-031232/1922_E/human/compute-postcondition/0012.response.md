Output State: **`t` is 0; `x` is an odd number; `max` is 100000000; `min` is -100000000; `ans` is ' -100000000 '**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans` updates the `ans` variable by concatenating the string representation of `min` (which is `-100000000`) with a space and the current value of `ans` (which is an empty string). Therefore, `ans` becomes `' -100000000'`. The values of `t`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.
