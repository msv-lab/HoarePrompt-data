Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` must be different from 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 -99999999' or '-100000000 -99999999', depending on whether `x` is even or not.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `min` with a space and the current value of `ans`. Since `min` is -99999999, `ans` becomes either '100000000 -99999999' or '-100000000 -99999999', depending on whether `x` was initially even or odd. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `max`, and `min`) remain unchanged.
