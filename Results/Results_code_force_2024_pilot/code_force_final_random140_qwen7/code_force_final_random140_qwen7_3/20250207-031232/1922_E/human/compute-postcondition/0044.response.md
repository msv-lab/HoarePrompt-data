Output State: **`t` is equal to the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, and `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` and ending with `min`.**

Explanation: The code `max = 100000000` simply assigns the value 100000000 to the variable `max`. This changes the value of `max` but does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, `min`, or `ans`. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `max`.
