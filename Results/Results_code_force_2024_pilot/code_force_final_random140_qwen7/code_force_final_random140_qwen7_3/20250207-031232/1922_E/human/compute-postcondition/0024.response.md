Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is either '100000000 -99999999' or '-100000000 -99999999', depending on whether `x` is even or not.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 (or any other value different from 1) to 0. All other variables (`t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the operation `x -= 1`.
