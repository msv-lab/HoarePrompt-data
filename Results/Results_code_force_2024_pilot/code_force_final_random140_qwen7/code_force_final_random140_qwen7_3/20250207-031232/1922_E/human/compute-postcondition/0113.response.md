Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either 0.5 or `original_x_value - 1`, `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is a string containing `min` and `max` values with appropriate spacing followed by ' ' and `max`, `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999**

Explanation: The code updates the `ans` variable by appending a space and the value of `max` to the existing string value of `ans`. Since `max` can be either 99999998 or 99999999, `ans` will now contain the original string value followed by a space and the corresponding value of `max`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
