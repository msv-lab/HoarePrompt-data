Output State: **`min` is -100000000, `ans` is ' ' + `max`, `i` is `input_value - 1`, `max` is 99999999, `t` is 0, `x` is the current value of `x` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides the current value of `x` by 2 using integer division. Since `x` must not be equal to 1 and its current value is even, after dividing by 2, `x` will still not be equal to 1 and will remain even. All other variables (`min`, `ans`, `i`, `max`, `t`) are not affected by this operation.
