Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `x != 1`.

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `t` is 0
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `min` is -100000000
   - `ans` is an empty string

4. **Adjust the state to meet the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must not be equal to 1. Since `x` is described as an input integer, it could be any integer except 1.

Given this information, we need to ensure that `x` is not equal to 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string**
