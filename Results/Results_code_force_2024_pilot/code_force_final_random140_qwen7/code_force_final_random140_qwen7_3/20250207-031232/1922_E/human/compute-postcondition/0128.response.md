Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer \(X\) (with \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\)) and an integer \(t\) (with \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)). It calculates the number of iterations \(t\) required to reduce \(X\) to 1 by repeatedly dividing \(X\) by 2 when even or decrementing \(X\) by 1 when odd. Additionally, it constructs a string `ans` containing a sequence of maximum and minimum values encountered during the process. Finally, it prints the total number of iterations and the constructed string.**
