Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is half of its original value, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '99999999 100000000' or '99999999 -100000000' depending on whether `x` is even or not.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is updated to be `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest integer. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Since `x` must be different from 1, and it is now half of its original value, the condition for `ans` (whether `x` is even or not) remains the same as before the operation.
