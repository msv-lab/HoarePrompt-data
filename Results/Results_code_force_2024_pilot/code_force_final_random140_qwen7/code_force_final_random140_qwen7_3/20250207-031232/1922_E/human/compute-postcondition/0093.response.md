Output State: **`min` is -100000000, `ans` is ' ' + `max`, `i` is `input_value - 1`, `max` is 99999999, `t` is 0, `x` must not be equal to 1, and the current value of `x` is even**

Explanation: The code `max -= 1` decrements the value of `max` by 1. Initially, `max` was set to 100000000, so after executing the code, `max` becomes 99999999. The other variables (`min`, `ans`, `i`, `t`, and `x`) remain unchanged according to the initial state provided.
