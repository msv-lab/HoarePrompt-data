Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 ' or '-100000000', depending on whether `x` is even or not.**

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
