The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` must not be equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still not be equal to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the condition of the loop.

State: **`t` is 1, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1, `min` is either -100000000 or -999999, `ans` is either 'max ' followed by the result of dividing `x` by 2 (if `x` is even) or the string '-100000000 ' (if `x` is odd), and `x` must not be equal to 1**
