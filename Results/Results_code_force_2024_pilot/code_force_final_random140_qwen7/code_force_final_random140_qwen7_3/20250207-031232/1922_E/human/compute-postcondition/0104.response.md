Output State: **`min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is either ' ' + `max` + ' ' + ' ' + `ans` or '-100000000 ' + ' ' + `ans`, `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `t` is 1, `x` is not 1**

Explanation: The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Since `max` could initially be either 99999999 or 100000000, after decrementing, it will be either 99999998 or 99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
