Output State: **`min` is -100000000, `ans` is a string that contains a sequence of numbers based on the operations performed during each iteration, `i` is `input_value - 1`, `max` is 100000000**.

Explanation: The line `min = -100000000` changes the value of the variable `min` from `-999999` to `-100000000`. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `ans`, `i`, and `max`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
