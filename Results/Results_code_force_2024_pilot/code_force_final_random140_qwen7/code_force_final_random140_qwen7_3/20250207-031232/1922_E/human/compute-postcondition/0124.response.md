Based on the initial state provided:

- `min` is -1.
- `ans` is a string containing all the `min` and `max` values from each iteration with appropriate spacing.
- `i` is `input_value - 1`.
- `max` is 1.
- `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.

The key points here are:
- `min` starts at -100000000 and increments by 1 each time `x` is odd, ending up at -1.
- `max` starts at 100000000 and decreases by 1 each time `x` is even, ending up at 1.
- `t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1.

The print statement `print(t)` will print the value of `t`.

Output: **t (where t is the total number of iterations until x becomes 1)**
