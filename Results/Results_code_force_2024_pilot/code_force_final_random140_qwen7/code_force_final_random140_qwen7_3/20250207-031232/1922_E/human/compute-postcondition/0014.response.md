Output State: **`t` is 0; `x` is an even number; `max` is 100000000; `min` is -99999999; `ans` is '-100000000'**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` was initially an odd number, after subtracting 1, `x` becomes an even number. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
