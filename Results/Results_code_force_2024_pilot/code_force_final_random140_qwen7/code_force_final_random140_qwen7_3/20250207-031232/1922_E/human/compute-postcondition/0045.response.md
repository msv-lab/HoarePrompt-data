Output State: **`t` is equal to the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is an input integer, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` and ending with `min`.**

Explanation: The line `min = -100000000` updates the value of `min` to -100000000. All other variables (`t`, `x`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
