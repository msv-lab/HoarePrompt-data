Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.
2. **Current state analysis**:
   - `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000.
   - `ans` is either ' ' + `max` or '-100000000 '.
   - `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`.
   - `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000.
   - `t` is 1.
   - `x` is either the current value of `x` divided by 2 (if it was even) or is odd.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue executing, `x` must not be equal to 1. Therefore, `x` must be something other than 1.
   - The values of `min`, `ans`, `i`, `max`, and `t` do not directly affect the loop condition and can remain unchanged.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is either ' ' + `max` or '-100000000 ', `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `t` is 1, `x` is not 1**
