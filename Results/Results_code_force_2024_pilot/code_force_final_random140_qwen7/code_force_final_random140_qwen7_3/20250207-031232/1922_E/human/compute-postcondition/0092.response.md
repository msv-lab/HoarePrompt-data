Output State: **`min` is -100000000, `ans` is ' ' + `max`, `i` is `input_value - 1`, `max` is 100000000, `t` is 0, `x` must not be equal to 1, and the current value of `x` is even**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `max` (which is "100000000") to the existing value of `ans`, which is an empty string. So, `ans` becomes the string "100000000 ". The values of `min`, `i`, `max`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged.
