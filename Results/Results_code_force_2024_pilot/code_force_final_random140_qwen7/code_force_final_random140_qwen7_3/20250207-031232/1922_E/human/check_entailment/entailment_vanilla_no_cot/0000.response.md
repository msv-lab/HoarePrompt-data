Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in the program is flawed and does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Generating Increasing Subsequences**: The program attempts to generate an array by alternating between the maximum and minimum possible values within a fixed range. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. 

2. **Misunderstanding of Increasing Subsequences**: The program tries to reduce `X` to 1 by repeatedly dividing it by 2 and adjusting the maximum and minimum values accordingly. However, this method does not account for the combinatorial nature of increasing subsequences, which can be complex and not straightforwardly reduced in this manner.

3. **Output Format**: Even if the program were to work correctly, the output format would still need to be adjusted to include the length of the array and the actual array elements, as specified in the problem statement.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to use a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving combinatorial mathematics or dynamic programming to count and construct arrays with the exact number of increasing subsequences.
