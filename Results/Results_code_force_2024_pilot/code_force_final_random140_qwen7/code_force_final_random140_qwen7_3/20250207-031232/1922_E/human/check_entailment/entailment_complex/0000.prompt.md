Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = ''
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: `min` is 999999, `ans` is a string containing all the `min` and `max` values from each iteration with appropriate spacing, `i` is `input_value - 1`, `max` is 1, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer \(X\) (with \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\)) and an integer \(t\) (with \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)). It calculates the number of iterations \(t\) required to reduce \(X\) to 1 by repeatedly dividing \(X\) by 2 when even or decrementing \(X\) by 1 when odd. Additionally, it constructs a string `ans` containing a sequence of maximum and minimum values encountered during the process. Finally, it prints the total number of iterations and the constructed string.
