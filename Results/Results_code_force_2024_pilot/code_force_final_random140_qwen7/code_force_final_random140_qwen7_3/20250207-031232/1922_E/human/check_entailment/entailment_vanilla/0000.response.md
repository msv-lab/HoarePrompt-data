### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The array length must be at most 200.
   - The array elements should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
   - If no such array exists, output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program attempts to construct the array using a binary representation approach.
   - It initializes `max` and `min` to represent the largest and smallest possible values for the array elements.
   - It uses a loop to construct the string `ans` by alternating between setting elements to `max` and `min`.
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 1, which theoretically represents the number of elements needed in the array.

3. **Issues Identified:**
   - **Incorrect Logic for Constructing Increasing Subsequences:**
     - The program does not correctly ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
     - The logic of alternating between `max` and `min` does not guarantee the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - **Handling Edge Cases:**
     - The program does not handle cases where `X` cannot be achieved with an array of length at most 200.
     - For example, if `X` is very large, the program will attempt to construct an array of length 100000000, which exceeds the limit.
   - **Output Format:**
     - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, but it does not correctly calculate the array to meet the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It attempts to use a binary representation approach, which is not appropriate for generating arrays with a specific number of increasing subsequences.
