Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in how it attempts to construct the array with the exact number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the logic for constructing the array based on the value of \(X\) is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Constructing the Array**: The program tries to construct an array by alternating between the maximum and minimum possible values within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\). However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. The construction method used here is more related to binary representation or simple arithmetic operations rather than ensuring the exact count of increasing subsequences.

2. **Misunderstanding of Increasing Subsequences**: The problem requires finding an array such that it has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. The given solution does not address this requirement. Instead, it seems to be attempting to create a sequence based on the parity of \(X\) and the range of values, which is not relevant to the actual problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when \(X = 2\) or when \(X\) is a prime number, which would require specific constructions that the current logic cannot produce.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
