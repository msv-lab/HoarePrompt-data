Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic as described. The logic in the function `func()` incorrectly assumes that the player with more coins always wins, which is not true based on the game rules.

According to the game rules:
- Both players take turns, and each turn involves removing one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., a player whose wallet has 0 coins) loses.
- The players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        diff = abs(n - k)
        if diff % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected function checks the absolute difference between `n` and `k`. If the difference is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because:
- If the difference is even, the player who starts (Alice) will eventually be left with a difference of 0 when it's her turn, making her lose.
- If the difference is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by maintaining the odd difference until Bob is left with 0 coins.

Thus, the original solution is incorrect, and the corrected solution should be used instead.
