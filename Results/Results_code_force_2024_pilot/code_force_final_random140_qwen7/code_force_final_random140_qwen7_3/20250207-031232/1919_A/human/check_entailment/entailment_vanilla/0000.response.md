### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - Both players take turns.
   - Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or keep them.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets respectively.
   - It then compares `n` and `k`:
     - If `n > k`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If `n < k`, it prints 'Alice'.
     - If `n == k`, it also prints 'Bob'.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: `n > k`**:
     - If Alice has more coins than Bob, she can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and removing a coin. This is because Bob will eventually run out of coins and be unable to make a move.
   - **Case 2: `n < k`**:
     - If Alice has fewer coins than Bob, she can force Bob into a losing position by not swapping wallets and removing a coin. This is because Bob will eventually run out of coins and be unable to make a move.
   - **Case 3: `n == k`**:
     - If Alice and Bob have the same number of coins, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and removing a coin. This is because after swapping, Bob will have more coins and will eventually run out of coins.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies the winner based on the initial number of coins in each player's wallet.
   - The code handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
