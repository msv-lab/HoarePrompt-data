You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _rep in range(t):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n > k:
            print('Bob')
        elif n < k:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _rep in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n > k:
            print('Bob')
        elif n < k:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
        
    #State: rep is 2, _rep is 2, n is an input integer, k is an input integer, the values of n and k are the integers entered by the user separated by space in the third iteration. Regardless of whether n is greater than k or not, the values of rep and _rep remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple pairs of integers \(n\) and \(k\) from the user, compares each pair, and prints 'Bob' if \(n > k\), 'Alice' if \(n < k\), and 'Bob' again if \(n = k\). The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - Both players take turns.
   - Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or keep them.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets respectively.
   - It then compares `n` and `k`:
     - If `n > k`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If `n < k`, it prints 'Alice'.
     - If `n == k`, it also prints 'Bob'.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: `n > k`**:
     - If Alice has more coins than Bob, she can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and removing a coin. This is because Bob will eventually run out of coins and be unable to make a move.
   - **Case 2: `n < k`**:
     - If Alice has fewer coins than Bob, she can force Bob into a losing position by not swapping wallets and removing a coin. This is because Bob will eventually run out of coins and be unable to make a move.
   - **Case 3: `n == k`**:
     - If Alice and Bob have the same number of coins, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and removing a coin. This is because after swapping, Bob will have more coins and will eventually run out of coins.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies the winner based on the initial number of coins in each player's wallet.
   - The code handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.

**True**
