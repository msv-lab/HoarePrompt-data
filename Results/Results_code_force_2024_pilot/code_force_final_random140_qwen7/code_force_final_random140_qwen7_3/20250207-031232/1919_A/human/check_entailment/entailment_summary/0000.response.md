Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules as described. According to the problem statement, the game involves taking turns and removing one coin from a player's wallet until someone cannot make a valid move. The program simply compares the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on which is greater or equal, without simulating the actual game turns.

To determine the winner correctly, the program should simulate the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob, removing one coin from the current player's wallet each turn, and checking after each move whether the current player can still make a valid move. The provided code does not do this; it only checks the initial condition and does not account for the game's dynamic nature.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
