Output State: **rep is 2, _rep is 2, n is an input integer, k is an input integer, the values of n and k are the integers entered by the user separated by space in the third iteration. Regardless of whether n is greater than k or not, the values of rep and _rep remain unchanged.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (in this case, 3 times as per the given information), the variable `_rep` will have the value of `t-1`, which is 2. The variable `rep` will also reflect the final iteration count, so it will be 2. The values of `n` and `k` will be the ones entered in the last iteration of the loop, which is the third iteration based on the provided information.
