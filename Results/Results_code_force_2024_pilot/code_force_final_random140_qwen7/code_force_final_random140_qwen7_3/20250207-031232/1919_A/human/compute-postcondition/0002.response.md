Output State: **_rep is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The variable `_rep` remains unchanged and is still 0. The values of `n` and `k` are the integers obtained from the input.
