Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `rep` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- If `n` is greater than `k`, no changes are made.
- If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made.

### Loop Head:
```python
for _rep in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `_rep` is used to iterate from `0` to `t-1`.
- The loop does not modify `n` or `k`.
- The only state that can change within the loop is `_rep`.

### Determining the Next State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `_rep` would have been incremented by 1.
- Therefore, if `_rep` was 0 before the loop started, it would now be 1.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

### Updated State:
- `_rep` is now 1.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `k` remains an input integer.

### Final Answer:
State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
