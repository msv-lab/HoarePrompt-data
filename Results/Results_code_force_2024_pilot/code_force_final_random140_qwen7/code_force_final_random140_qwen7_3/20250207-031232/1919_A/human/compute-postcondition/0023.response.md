Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `_rep` and `t`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `_rep` in the range from 0 to `t-1`.
3. **Determine the state changes**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `rep` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. These values do not change within the loop.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `_rep` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `_rep` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration (where `_rep` is 0), the next iteration will start with `_rep` being 1.

Given that the only variable in the loop head is `_rep` and it needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again, the state needs to be adjusted accordingly.

**State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_rep` is 1**
