#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 3 <= num <= 78.
def func_1(num):
    if (1 <= num <= 26) :
        return chr(num + 96)
        #The program returns a character between 'd' and 'z' inclusive
    #State: num is an integer such that 3 <= num <= 78, and num is greater than 26
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range of 3 to 78 inclusive. If `num` is between 1 and 26, it returns the corresponding lowercase letter from 'd' to 'z'. Otherwise, it does not perform any return action and leaves the program state unchanged. The function ultimately ensures that if a valid `num` is provided, it returns a character between 'd' and 'z' inclusive.
