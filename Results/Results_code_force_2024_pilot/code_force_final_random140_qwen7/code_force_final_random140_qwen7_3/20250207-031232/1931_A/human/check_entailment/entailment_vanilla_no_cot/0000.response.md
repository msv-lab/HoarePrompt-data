Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all possible cases for encoding a 3-letter word into a given integer `n`. Specifically, it fails to account for cases where the quotient of `n // 26` is greater than 2, which means the word could have more than two 'z's.

Let's break down the issues and provide a corrected version:

1. **Handling Quotient Greater Than 2**: The current logic only handles up to `n // 26 == 2`, meaning it can only correctly decode words where the sum of the positions is less than or equal to `2 * 26 + 25 = 77`. However, the problem states that the encoded integer `n` can be between 3 and 78, so we need to handle cases where `n // 26` is 3 or more.

2. **Lexicographical Smallest Word**: The solution should always try to make the first character as small as possible while ensuring the sum matches `n`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = ''
    b = ''
    c = ''
    
    # Calculate the position of the first character
    if n >= 27 * 2 + 25:  # If n is at least 78
        a = 'z'
        n -= 27
    else:
        a = chr(96 + (n // 26))
        n %= 26
    
    # Calculate the position of the second character
    if n >= 26:  # If there is any remaining value after placing the first character
        b = 'z'
        n -= 26
    else:
        b = chr(96 + n)
        n = 0
    
    # The third character will be 'a' if there is no remaining value
    c = 'a' if n == 0 else chr(96 + n)
    
    print(a + b + c)
```

This corrected version ensures that the word is constructed in a way that respects the constraints and always produces the lexicographically smallest word.
