Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an integer from the input split, `d` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `c` and `d` respectively. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
