Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an integer from the input split, `d` is an integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is an integer from the input split, `h` is an integer from the input split, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`, if `x > n`, then the condition holds as is; otherwise, the condition also holds as is.
