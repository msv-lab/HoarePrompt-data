Output: **(a - c)² + (b - d)² (where a and b are input integers, and c and d are integers from the input split)**

Explanation:
- `n` is defined as `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, which simplifies to \((a - c)² + (b - d)²\).
- Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, we express `n` in terms of these variables.
- The `print(n)` statement will print the value of `n`, which is \((a - c)² + (b - d)²\).
