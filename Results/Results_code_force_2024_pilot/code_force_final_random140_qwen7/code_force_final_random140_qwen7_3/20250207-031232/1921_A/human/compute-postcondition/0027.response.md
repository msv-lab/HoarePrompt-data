Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split, `f` is the second integer from input split.**

Explanation: The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `e` and `f` respectively. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial states.
