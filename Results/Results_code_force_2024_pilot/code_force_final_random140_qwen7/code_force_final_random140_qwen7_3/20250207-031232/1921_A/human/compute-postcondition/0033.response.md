Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split, `f` is the second integer from input split, `g` is the first integer from the split input converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the split input converted to an integer, `n` is (a - c)² + (b - d)², `x` is (a - e)² + (b - f)². If `x` is greater than `n`, then the program continues with the condition that `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, the program continues with the condition that `x` is not greater than `n`.**
