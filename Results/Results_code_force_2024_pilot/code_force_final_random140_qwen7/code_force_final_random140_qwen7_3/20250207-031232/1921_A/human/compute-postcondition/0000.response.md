Output State: **t is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state only mentions that the function takes no input parameters, the only change is that `t` now holds the integer input provided by the user. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
