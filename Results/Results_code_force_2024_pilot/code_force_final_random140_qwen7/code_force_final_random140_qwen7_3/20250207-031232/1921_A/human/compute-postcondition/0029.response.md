Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split, `f` is the second integer from input split, `g` is the first integer from the split input converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the split input converted to an integer, `n` is (a - c)Â² + (b - d)Â²**.

Explanation: The code calculates `n` as the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `c`, and `b` and `d`. Since `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are input integers, `n` will be the calculated value based on these inputs. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
