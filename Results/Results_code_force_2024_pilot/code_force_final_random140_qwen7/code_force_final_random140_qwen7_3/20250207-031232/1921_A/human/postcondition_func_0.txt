The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four lines of input. Each line contains two integers \(x_i, y_i\) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the squared distance between two pairs of opposite corners and prints the larger of the two distances. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.
