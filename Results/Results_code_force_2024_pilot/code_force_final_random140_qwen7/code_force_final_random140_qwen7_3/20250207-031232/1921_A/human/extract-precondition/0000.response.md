Precondition: **The function takes no input parameters. Each testcase is represented by four lines, where each line contains two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. It is guaranteed that these points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**
