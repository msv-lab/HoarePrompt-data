Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` if `start < s < end`, where `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[3]` or `f[j] + b[3]` depending on whether `j >= 1`.**

Explanation: The code `remain = mid - b[i]` updates the value of `remain` to `mid - b[3]` since `i` was initially 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
