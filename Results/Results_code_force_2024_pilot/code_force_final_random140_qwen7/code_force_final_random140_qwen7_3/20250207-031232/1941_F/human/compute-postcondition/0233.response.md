Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order according to the new `remain` value, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` if `start < s < end`, where `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - (f[j - 1] + b[3]), (f[j - 1] + b[3]) - start, nd)` if `start < (f[j - 1] + b[3]) < end`.

This postcondition summarizes that `i` remains 3, `j` is the insertion index for `remain` in `f`, `remain` is calculated as `mid - b[3]`, and `res` is updated based on the conditions involving `start`, `end`, and `s` (where `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[3]`).
