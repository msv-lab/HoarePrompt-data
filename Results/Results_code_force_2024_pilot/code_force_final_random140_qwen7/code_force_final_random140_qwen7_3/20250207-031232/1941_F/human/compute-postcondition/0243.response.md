Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order according to the new `remain` value, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and either `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` where `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[3]` if `start < s < end`, or remains unchanged if the condition `start < s < end` is not met.
