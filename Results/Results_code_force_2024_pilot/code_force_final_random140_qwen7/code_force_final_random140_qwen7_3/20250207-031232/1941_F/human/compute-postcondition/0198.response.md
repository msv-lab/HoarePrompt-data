Postcondition: `mid` is subtracted by `b[i]` to get `remain`, `i` is 0, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order, `j` is not equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of `f[j]` and `b[i]`, and the current value of `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1.
