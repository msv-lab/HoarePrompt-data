Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `m`**:
   - The variable `i` is typically initialized to 0 before entering the loop.
   - The variable `m` is determined by the `range()` function, which means it is derived from the length of some iterable or a specific integer value.

3. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - `start` is equal to the first element in the tuple at index 0 of the list `gap`.
   - `end` is equal to the third element in the tuple at index 0 of the list `gap`.
   - `mid` is calculated as (`start` + `end`) // 2.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `f` is the sorted list of integers.
   - `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise it is the first element in the tuple at index 1 of the list `gap`.
   - `res` is infinity (float('inf')).

4. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. Therefore, we need to adjust these two variables.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` should start at 0 and `m` should be a positive integer representing the number of iterations.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `m` should be set to a positive integer, which is typically the length of an iterable or a specific value that determines the number of iterations.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be a positive integer**
