Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order according to the new `remain` value, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` if `start < s < end`, where `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - (f[j - 1] + b[3]), (f[j - 1] + b[3]) - start, nd)` if `start < (f[j - 1] + b[3]) < end`.

This postcondition describes the state of the variables `i`, `j`, `remain`, and `res` after the execution of the if-else block. It covers both the case when `start < s < end` and the absence of an else part, ensuring that `res` is updated appropriately based on the given conditions.
