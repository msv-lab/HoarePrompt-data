Output State: **`b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `f` is the same list of integers, `gap` is a list of tuples each containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a` and the elements themselves**.

Explanation: The code creates a new list called `gap` which contains tuples. Each tuple consists of two elements from the list `a`: the difference between consecutive elements `(y - x)` and the corresponding elements `x` and `y`. Since `a` is not defined in the given code snippet, we cannot provide specific values for `gap`. However, we know that `b` and `f` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
