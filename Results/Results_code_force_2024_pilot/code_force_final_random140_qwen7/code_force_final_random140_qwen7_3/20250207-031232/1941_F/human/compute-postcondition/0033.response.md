Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[0]`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[0]`, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, `res` is assigned the minimum value between `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`.**
