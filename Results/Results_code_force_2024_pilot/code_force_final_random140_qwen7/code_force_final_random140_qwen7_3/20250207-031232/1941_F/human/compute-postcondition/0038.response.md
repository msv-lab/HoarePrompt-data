Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(m):` statement. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - `m` is a positive integer.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is an upper bound and does not change within the loop.

5. **New Values**:
   - After the loop starts its next iteration, `i` will be 1 (since it was 0 before and is incremented by 1).
   - `m` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer**.
