Postcondition: `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (`end - s`, `s - start`, `nd`), while `i` is `m` (with `m` being greater than 0), `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the index where `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)` inserts `remain` to keep `f` sorted, and `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.
