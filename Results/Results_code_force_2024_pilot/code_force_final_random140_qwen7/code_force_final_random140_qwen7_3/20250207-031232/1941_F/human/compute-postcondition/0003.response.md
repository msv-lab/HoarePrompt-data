Output State: **`b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are no longer defined**.

Explanation: The code `b = [*map(int, input().split())]` takes input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `b`. As a result, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are no longer defined in the current scope.
