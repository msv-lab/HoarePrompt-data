Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order according to the new `remain` value, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is `min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[3]`. If `start < s < end`, then `res` is updated to `min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
