Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes four lists (a, d, f) and three integers (n, m, k) as inputs. The integer t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 \cdot 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}. The list d contains m integers such that 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9. The list f contains k integers such that 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
