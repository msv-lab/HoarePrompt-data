Postcondition: `mid` is decreased by `b[i]`, resulting in `remain`; `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted to keep list `f` sorted; `s` is the sum of `f[j - 1]` and `b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, then `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (end - s, s - start, nd). Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
