Postcondition: `i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0; `remain` is `mid - b[i]`; `j` is the index where `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)` inserts `remain` to keep `f` sorted; `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `remain`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.
