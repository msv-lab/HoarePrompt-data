Output State: **`b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `f` is the same list of integers**.

Explanation: The code `f = [*map(int, input().split())]` takes the input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `f`. Since `b` was already defined as a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `f` ends up being the same list. The initial state of `b` remains unchanged except that now `f` also holds the same list of integers.
