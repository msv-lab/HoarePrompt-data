Postcondition: `mid` is decreased by `b[i]`, resulting in `remain`; `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted to keep list `f` sorted; `s` is the sum of `f[j - 1]` and `b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, then `res` is assigned the minimum value between `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`. Otherwise, the values of `res`, `mid`, `remain`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.
