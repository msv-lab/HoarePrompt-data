Postcondition: `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)`, `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `start < s < end`, or `f[j] + b[i]` if `j >= 1`, and `res` is the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` if `start < s < end`, and the values of `i`, `m`, `remain`, `j`, `s`, and `res` remain unchanged if `j < 1`.
