Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is now a sorted list of integers (same as `b`), `gap` is a list of tuples each containing the difference between consecutive elements in `b` and the elements themselves sorted in descending order, `end` is equal to the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is equal to (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1 else the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `start` is equal to the first element of the tuple in `gap` which is the difference between consecutive elements in `b` and the elements themselves, sorted in descending order, `res` is infinity.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `mid` is subtracted by `b[i]` to get `remain`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order, and `j` is not equal to `k`. The value of `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `(end - s, s - start, nd)` if `start < s < end`, where `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` when `i` is 1 or the sum of `f[j - 1]` and `b[i]` when `i` is 0. If `start < s < end` does not hold, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, and `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` if `start < s < end`, where `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` or `f[j] + b[i]` depending on whether `j >= 1`. If the condition `start < s < end` is not met, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order according to the new `remain` value, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` if `start < s < end`, where `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[3]` or `f[j] + b[3]` depending on whether `j >= 1`. If `j == k`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - (f[j - 1] + b[3]), (f[j - 1] + b[3]) - start, nd)` if `start < (f[j - 1] + b[3]) < end`. Otherwise, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - (f[j] + b[3]), (f[j] + b[3]) - start, nd)` if `start < f[j] + b[3] < end`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
