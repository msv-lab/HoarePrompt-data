Postcondition: `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (`end - s`, `s - start`, `nd`), while `i` is `m` (and `m` must be greater than 0); `remain` is `mid - b[i]`; `j` is the index where `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)` inserts `remain` to keep `f` sorted; `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, then `res` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
