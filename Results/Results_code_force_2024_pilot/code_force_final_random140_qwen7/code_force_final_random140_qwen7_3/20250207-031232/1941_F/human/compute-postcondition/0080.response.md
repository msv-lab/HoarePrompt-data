Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is equal to `m-1`, `m` remains as the initial positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[m-1]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` or `f[j] + b[i]`, and `res` is the minimum value found during the loop iterations of `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` whenever the condition `start < s < end` is satisfied. Additionally, `res` is either infinity or the minimum value found under the specified condition.**
