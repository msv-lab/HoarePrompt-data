Output State: **`b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `f` is the same list of integers, `gap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difference between consecutive elements in `b` and the elements themselves sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code `gap.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `gap` in descending order based on the first element of each tuple (which represents the difference between consecutive elements in `b`). The other variables (`b` and `f`) remain unchanged.
