Output State: **`b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `f` is the same list of integers, `gap` is a list of tuples each containing the difference between consecutive elements in `b` and the elements themselves sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `gap` list in descending order based on the differences between consecutive elements in `b`. The values of `b` and `f` remain unchanged. The `gap` list now contains tuples with each tuple consisting of the difference between consecutive elements in `b` and the elements themselves, sorted in descending order.
