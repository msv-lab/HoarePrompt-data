Output State: **`b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `f` is the same list of integers, `gap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difference between consecutive elements in `a` and the elements themselves**.

Explanation: The code creates a new list called `gap` using a list comprehension. This list comprehension iterates over pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a[1:]` (which is `a` starting from the second element) and the original list `a`. For each pair `(y, x)`, it calculates the difference `y - x` and forms a tuple `(y - x, x, y)`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a`, the output state only describes the structure of the `gap` list in terms of its relationship to `a`. The variables `b` and `f` remain unchanged from their initial state.
