Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` contains a finite value, which is the minimum value among all the updates made during the iterations.
- `res` is not equal to infinity.

Given this information, when the `print(res)` statement is executed, it will print the finite value stored in `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the minimum value among all the updates made during the iterations and is not equal to infinity)**
