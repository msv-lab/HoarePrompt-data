Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(m)`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `m`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m-1`.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the new state of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `(m-1) + 1 = m`.

4. **Determine the new state of `m`**:
   - The value of `m` does not change within the loop; it remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.

5. **Adjust other states based on the loop head**:
   - The other states (`remain`, `j`, `res`, `s`, `start`, `end`, `f`, `b`, `k`, and `nd`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the only adjustments needed are for the variables `i` and `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0**.
