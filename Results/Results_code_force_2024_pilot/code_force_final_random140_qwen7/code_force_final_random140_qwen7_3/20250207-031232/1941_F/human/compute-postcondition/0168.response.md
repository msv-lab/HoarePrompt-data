Output State: **`b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are no longer defined.**

Explanation: The code `b = [*map(int, input().split())]` takes the input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are no longer defined or referenced after this line of code.
