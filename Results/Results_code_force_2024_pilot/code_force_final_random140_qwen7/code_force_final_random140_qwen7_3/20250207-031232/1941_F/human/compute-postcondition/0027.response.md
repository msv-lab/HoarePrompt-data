Postcondition: `i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[0]`, `s` is `f[j] + b[0]`. If `start < s < end`, then `res` is updated to the minimum of the previous value of `res` and the maximum of `end - s` and `s - start`, and `nd` remains unchanged. If the condition `start < s < end` is not met, then the values of `res` and `nd` remain unchanged.
