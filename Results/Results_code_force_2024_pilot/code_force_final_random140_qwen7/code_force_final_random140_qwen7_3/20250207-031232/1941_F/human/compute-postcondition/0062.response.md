Postcondition: `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and `res` is the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`. If `start < s < end`, then `j` is updated to the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)` and `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`.
