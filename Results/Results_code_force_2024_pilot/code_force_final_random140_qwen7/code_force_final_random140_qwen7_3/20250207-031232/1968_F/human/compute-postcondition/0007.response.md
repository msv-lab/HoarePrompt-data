Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `x` is a list with its last element being `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` includes the length of `x` minus one (i.e., `len(x) - 1`).**

Explanation: The code appends the index of the last element in the list `x` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Since `x[-1]` is `x[-1] ^ i`, the updated state includes that `inds[x[-1]]` now contains the length of `x` minus one. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
