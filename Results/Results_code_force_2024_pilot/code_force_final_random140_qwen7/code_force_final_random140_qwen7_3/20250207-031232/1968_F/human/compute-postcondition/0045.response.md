Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `q` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.
- `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, but since the function call does not specify an argument, it's assumed to be `func_1(i)`, which would be `func_1(1)`. Without knowing the implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.
- `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, again assuming it's `func_1(i)`, which would be `func_1(1)`. Therefore, `r` is also dependent on the implementation of `func_1`.
- `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, where `x` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
- `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`, similarly, `x` is not defined, so we cannot determine its value.

However, the print statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or their values. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
