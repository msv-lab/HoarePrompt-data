Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is the result of calling `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n for each query.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(func_1(int))` calls the function `func_1` with an integer argument (the result of `int()` which is `0`). The return value of `func_1(0)` is converted to a list and assigned to `a`. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
