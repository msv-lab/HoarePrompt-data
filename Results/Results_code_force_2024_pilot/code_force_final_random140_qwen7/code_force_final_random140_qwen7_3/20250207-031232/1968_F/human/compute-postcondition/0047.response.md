Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`. If `upper > lower` and `l <= upper <= r` and `l <= lower <= r`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.**
