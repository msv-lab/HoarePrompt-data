Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the return values from `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the return value from `func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)`**.

Explanation: The code defines a new variable `upper` which is assigned the return value of `func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)`. The function `func_2` is called with two arguments: `inds[x[l - 1]]` and a lambda function that checks if an argument is less than or equal to `r`. The values of `i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `inds` remain unchanged from their initial state.
