Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is the result of calling `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n for each query, `x` is a list containing the single element 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `x` with a single element `0`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
