Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the index found by `func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` or -1 if no such index exists.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `upper` by calling `func_2` with `inds[x[l - 1]]` as the first argument and a lambda function `lambda arg: arg <= r` as the second argument. The value of `l` is used to compute `x[l - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
