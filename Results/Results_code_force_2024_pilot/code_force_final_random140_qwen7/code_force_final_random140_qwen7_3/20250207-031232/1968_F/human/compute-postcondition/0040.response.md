Postcondition: `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, we continue the loop. If `x[l - 1]` is not equal to `x[r]`, the else part does not change the values of the variables, so the conditions remain the same.
