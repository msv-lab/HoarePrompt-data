Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `x` is a list with its last element being `x[-1] ^ i`, where `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operation.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `x` the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` (denoted as `x[-1]`) and the variable `i`. Since `a` must contain at least one element, the initial state of `a` remains unchanged, but `x` is updated with the new element resulting from the XOR operation.
