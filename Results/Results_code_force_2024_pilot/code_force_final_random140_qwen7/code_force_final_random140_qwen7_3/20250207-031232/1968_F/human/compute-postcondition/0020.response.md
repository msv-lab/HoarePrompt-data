Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the return values from `func_1(int)`, and we continue in the loop or block.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, the values of `i`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The precondition that `q` must be greater than 0 and the values of `l` and `r` being the return values from `func_1(int)` are still valid. Additionally, the condition that `x[l - 1]` is equal to the value of `x[r]` remains true.
