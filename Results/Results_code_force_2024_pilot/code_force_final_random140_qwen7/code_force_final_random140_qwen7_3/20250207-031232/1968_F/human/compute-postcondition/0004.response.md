Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is the result of calling `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n for each query, `x` is a list containing the single element 0; `inds[0]` is a list containing the element 0.**

Explanation: The code `inds[0].append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list associated with the key `0` in the `defaultdict inds`. Initially, `inds[0]` was an empty list, and after executing the code, it contains the element `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
