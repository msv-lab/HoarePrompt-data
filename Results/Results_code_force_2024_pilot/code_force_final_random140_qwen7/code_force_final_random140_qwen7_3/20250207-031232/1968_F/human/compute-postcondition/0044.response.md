Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `upper` to be `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
