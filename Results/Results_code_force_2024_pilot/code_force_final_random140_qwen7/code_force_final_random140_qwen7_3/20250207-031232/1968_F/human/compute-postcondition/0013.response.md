Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element from `a` after the operation, `x` contains an additional element which is the bitwise XOR of the last element of `x` and the next element `i` from `a`; `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the index `len(x) - 1` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Here, `x[-1]` refers to the last element of `x`, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` and the next element `i` from `a`. The values of `a`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged except for the addition of the new element to `x` through the bitwise XOR operation, and the update to `inds[x[-1]]`.
