Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the return values from `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][inds[x[l - 1]][upper]]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `upper` to be `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`. Since `upper` was previously the return value from `func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)`, it is now updated to be the value at the index `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
