Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the return values from `func_1(int)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` was called with an integer argument, and it returned two values which were assigned to `l` and `r`. The initial values of `i` and `q` remain unchanged, and the condition that `q` must be greater than 0 still holds.
