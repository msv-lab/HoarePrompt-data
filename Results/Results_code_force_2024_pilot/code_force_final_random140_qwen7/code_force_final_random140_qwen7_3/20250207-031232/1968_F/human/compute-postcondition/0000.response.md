Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n for each query, and the function `func_1` has been called with an argument of type `int`.**

The code snippet `n, q = func_1(int)` calls the function `func_1` with an integer argument (the exact integer value is not specified) and assigns the return values of the function to the variables `n` and `q`. However, since the exact return values of `func_1` are not specified, we keep the initial conditions for `n` and `q` intact, noting that they are modified by the function call. The other variables (`a`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
