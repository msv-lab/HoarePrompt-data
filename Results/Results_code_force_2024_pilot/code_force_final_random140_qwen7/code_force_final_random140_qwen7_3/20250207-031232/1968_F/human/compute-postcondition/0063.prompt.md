You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5. a is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}. l and r are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n for each query.
def func_3():
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list where each element is the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds[x[-1]]` is a list containing all indices from 0 to the length of `x` - 1.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will be exhausted since it is iterated over completely. For each element `i` in `a`, the variable `x` appends the current value of `x[-1]` bitwise XORed with `i`. This means that `x` will contain the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `a` up to the current step. The dictionary `inds` maps each value in `x` to a list of indices where that value appears in `x`, which will include all indices from 0 to the length of `x` - 1 because each new value in `x` is added immediately after the previous value.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
        
        upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
        
        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `i` is equal to `q`, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list where each element is the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds[x[-1]]` is a list containing all indices from 0 to the length of `x` - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `a` of integers, and for each query defined by `l` and `r`, it returns a result based on the subarray of `a` from index `l` to `r`-1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
