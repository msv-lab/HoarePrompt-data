Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`**.

Explanation: The code `l, r = func_1(int)` calls the function `func_1` with an argument converted to an integer (`int`). The function returns two values, which are assigned to `l` and `r`. The initial values of `i` and `q` remain unchanged.
