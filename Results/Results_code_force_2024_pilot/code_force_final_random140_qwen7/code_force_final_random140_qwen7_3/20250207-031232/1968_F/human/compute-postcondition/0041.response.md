Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` or -1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value returned by `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` to the variable `lower` if the condition `arg < l` is true for `inds[x[r]]`. If no such value exists, `lower` is set to -1. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
