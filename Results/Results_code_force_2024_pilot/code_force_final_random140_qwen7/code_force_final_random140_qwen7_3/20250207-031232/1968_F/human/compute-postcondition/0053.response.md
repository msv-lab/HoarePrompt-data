Postcondition: `i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, and if `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, we continue the loop. If the condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` is not met, the loop continues as is without any changes to the variables.
