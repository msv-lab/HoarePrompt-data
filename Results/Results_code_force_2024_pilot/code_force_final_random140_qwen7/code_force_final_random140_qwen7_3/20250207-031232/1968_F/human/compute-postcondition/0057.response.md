Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is the value of `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `upper` to `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`. Here, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, and `x[l - 1]` refers to the element in the list `x` at the index `l - 1`. The value of `upper` is updated to the element in the list `inds` at the index specified by `x[l - 1]` and then at the index specified by `upper`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
