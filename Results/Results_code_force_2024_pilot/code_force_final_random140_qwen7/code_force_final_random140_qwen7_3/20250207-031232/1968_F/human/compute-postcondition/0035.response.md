Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given `for` loop is `i`, and the loop runs `q` times. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `q`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `q`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `q` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust `i`**: Since the loop runs `q` times and `i` starts at 0, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

4. **Adjust `q`**: The value of `q` does not change within the loop itself; it remains the same as long as the condition `i < q` holds true. Since `q` is greater than 0 initially, it will still be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Verify the Conditions**: We need to ensure that the conditions for the loop to continue executing are met. Given that `i` is now 1 and `q` is still greater than 0, the condition `i < q` will still hold true.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `q`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0**
