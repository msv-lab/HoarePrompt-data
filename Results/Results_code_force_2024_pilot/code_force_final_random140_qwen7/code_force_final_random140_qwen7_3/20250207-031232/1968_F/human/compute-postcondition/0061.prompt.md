Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list where each element is the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds[x[-1]]` is a list containing all indices from 0 to the length of `x` - 1.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will be exhausted since it is iterated over completely. For each element `i` in `a`, the variable `x` appends the current value of `x[-1]` bitwise XORed with `i`. This means that `x` will contain the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `a` up to the current step. The dictionary `inds` maps each value in `x` to a list of indices where that value appears in `x`, which will include all indices from 0 to the length of `x` - 1 because each new value in `x` is added immediately after the previous value.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
    upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
    lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
    if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the return values from `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][inds[x[l - 1]][upper]]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`, and either `upper` is greater than `lower` and `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`, or `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`, or `upper` is greater than `r`, or `lower` is greater than or equal to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`. If `upper > lower` and `l <= upper <= r` and `l <= lower <= r`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is the value of `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`. If `upper` is greater than `lower` and `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r` and `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
