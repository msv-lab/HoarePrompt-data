Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
from collections import defaultdict

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (t,) = func_1(int)
    for _ in range(t):
        func_3()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a callable object `cast` and a sequence of string representations of numbers. It applies the `cast` function to each element in the sequence and returns a map object containing the results.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    (l, r) = (0, len(arr))
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if predicate(arr[l]):
        return l
    return None
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function. It performs a binary search to find the index of the smallest element in the specified subarray that satisfies the predicate. If such an element exists, it returns its index; otherwise, it returns `None`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    (n, q) = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
    for i in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_1(int)
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
        upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
        lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and (l <= lower <= r):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function processes a list `a` of integers and handles `q` queries. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it checks if there exists any subarray within `a[l-1:r]` whose cumulative bitwise XOR equals the cumulative bitwise XOR of the entire array `a`. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.
