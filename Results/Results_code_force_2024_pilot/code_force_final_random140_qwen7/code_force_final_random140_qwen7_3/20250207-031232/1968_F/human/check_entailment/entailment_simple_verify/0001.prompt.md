You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will be exhausted since it is iterated over completely. For each element `i` in `a`, the variable `x` appends the current value of `x[-1]` bitwise XORed with `i`. This means that `x` will contain the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `a` up to the current step. The dictionary `inds` maps each value in `x` to a list of indices where that value appears in `x`, which will include all indices from 0 to the length of `x` - 1 because each new value in `x` is added immediately after the previous value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires checking if a subarray is "interesting," meaning it can be divided into `k` parts such that the XOR of each part is the same.
   - We need to process multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The XOR of a prefix of the array can help identify if a subarray is interesting.
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, it can always be divided into parts with the same XOR (e.g., each element is its own part).
   - If the XOR of the subarray is non-zero, we need to check if there exists a split point where the XOR values match.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function reads space-separated integers from input and applies a cast function.
   - **func_2:** This function performs binary search to find the first index where a condition is met.
   - **func_3:** This function processes the main logic:
     - Reads `n` and `q`.
     - Reads the array `a`.
     - Computes the prefix XOR values and stores indices in a dictionary.
     - For each query, checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero.
     - Uses binary search to find valid split points.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Prefix XOR Calculation:** 
     - Compute `x[i] = x[i-1] ^ a[i]` and store indices in `inds`.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - Check if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero.
     - Use binary search to find valid split points.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles the prefix XOR calculation and uses binary search to find valid split points.
   - It checks the XOR of the subarray and uses the indices to validate the split points.
   - The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution for determining if a subarray is interesting according to the given problem description.
