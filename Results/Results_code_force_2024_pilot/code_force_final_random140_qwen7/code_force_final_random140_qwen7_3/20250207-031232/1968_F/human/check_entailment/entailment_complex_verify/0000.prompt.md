You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

    #The program returns a map object that applies the callable object 'cast' to each element in the sequence of string representations of numbers entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a callable object `cast` and a sequence of string representations of numbers. It applies the `cast` function to each element in the sequence and returns a map object containing the results.

After all iterations of the loop, the variable `l` will be the index of the smallest element in the subarray defined by `l` and `r-1` that satisfies the predicate, or it will be 0 if no such element exists. The variable `r` will be the original length of the array, indicating the range in which the search was performed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function. It performs a binary search to find the index of the smallest element in the specified subarray that satisfies the predicate. If such an element exists, it returns its index; otherwise, it returns `None`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5. a is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}. l and r are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n for each query.

    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will be exhausted since it is iterated over completely. For each element `i` in `a`, the variable `x` appends the current value of `x[-1]` bitwise XORed with `i`. This means that `x` will contain the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `a` up to the current step. The dictionary `inds` maps each value in `x` to a list of indices where that value appears in `x`, which will include all indices from 0 to the length of `x` - 1 because each new value in `x` is added immediately after the previous value.

        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `i` is equal to `q`, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list where each element is the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds[x[-1]]` is a list containing all indices from 0 to the length of `x` - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of integers and handles `q` queries. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it checks if there exists any subarray within `a[l-1:r]` whose cumulative bitwise XOR equals the cumulative bitwise XOR of the entire array `a`. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for determining if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the subarray length is less than or equal to 1, which is not allowed according to the problem description (the subarray must be split into \(k > 1\) parts). Additionally, the program does not properly handle the case where the subarray can be split into multiple segments such that the XOR of each segment is equal.

For example, consider the following input:
- Array: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]`
- Query: `1 5`

The subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` is interesting because it can be split into `[1], [1], [2, 3, 0]`, and the XOR of each part is `1`. However, the provided program does not correctly identify this as an interesting subarray. This is because the program checks if `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, which is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is interesting. It also does not properly handle the case where the subarray can be split into more than one segment with equal XOR values.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and thus is incorrect.
