### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a sequence of string representations of numbers and converts them to integers using the provided `cast` function.
   - It correctly processes the input and returns a map object that contains the converted integers.
   
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the smallest index in the subarray that satisfies the given predicate.
   - The logic is correct and ensures that the binary search is performed efficiently.
   - However, the function returns `None` if no element satisfies the predicate, which might not be ideal in some contexts but is acceptable here as the main function handles this appropriately.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function calculates the cumulative bitwise XOR for the entire array and stores these values in the list `x`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `inds` that maps each cumulative XOR value to a list of indices where that value occurs.
   - For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR from the start to `l-1` is the same as the cumulative XOR from `l-1` to `r-1`. If so, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it uses binary search to find the appropriate indices and checks if they form a valid subarray that meets the criteria.
   - The logic for determining the validity of the subarray is correct and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. All functions work together seamlessly to achieve the desired result.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
