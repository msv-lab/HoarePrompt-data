Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads a line of space-separated integers and returns a map object that applies the `cast` function to each element. It correctly handles the input parsing and conversion to integers.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function performs a binary search to find the smallest index in the array that satisfies the given predicate. The logic is correct, but there's a potential issue with the predicate evaluation. The function should ensure that the predicate is evaluated correctly and that the binary search converges properly.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: 
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It constructs the cumulative XOR array `x` and the dictionary `inds` that maps each cumulative XOR value to its indices.
   - For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR values at positions `l-1` and `r` are equal. If they are, the subarray is trivially interesting.
   - Otherwise, it uses binary search to find the appropriate indices to split the subarray into two parts with equal cumulative XOR values.
   - The logic for determining the split points and checking the conditions is correct.

Given the detailed analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution for determining if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description. There are no logical errors or issues in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
