Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case is a quadruple of non-negative integers (p_i) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence. For each test case, it returns the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing four integers that represent the quantities of four different types of elements (1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s). The function processes these test cases and returns the counts of each type of element for each test case.
