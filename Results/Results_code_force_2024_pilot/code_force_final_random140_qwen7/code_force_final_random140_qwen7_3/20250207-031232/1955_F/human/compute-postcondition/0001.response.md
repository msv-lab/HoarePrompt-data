Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string into four integers using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
