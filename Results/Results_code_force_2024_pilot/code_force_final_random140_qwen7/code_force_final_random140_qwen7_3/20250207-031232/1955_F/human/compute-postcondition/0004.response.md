Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop variable `i` is derived from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value of `t` is used to determine the number of iterations of the loop.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - The value of `t` (which is the upper limit for the loop) remains the same unless it changes due to an input.
   - The other variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not part of the loop head and thus their values remain unchanged.

Given that the loop condition is based on `i < t`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `t`.

Since the exact value of `t` is not provided in the current state, we assume it remains the same as the initial value `t` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `t` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`**.
