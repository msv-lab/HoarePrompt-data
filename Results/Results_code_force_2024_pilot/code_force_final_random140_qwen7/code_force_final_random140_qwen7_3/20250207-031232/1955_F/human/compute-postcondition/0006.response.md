Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `t`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `a // 2`: This is the integer division of `a` by 2.
   - `b // 2`: This is the integer division of `b` by 2.
   - `c // 2`: This is the integer division of `c` by 2.
   - `d // 2`: This is the integer division of `d` by 2.
   - `a % 2`: This is the remainder when `a` is divided by 2.
   - `b % 2`: This is the remainder when `b` is divided by 2.
   - `c % 3`: This is the remainder when `c` is divided by 3.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`: This expression evaluates to 1 if the sum of the remainders `a % 2`, `b % 2`, and `c % 3` equals 3, otherwise it evaluates to 0.

4. **Combining the Results:**
   - The expression inside the `print` function sums up the integer divisions and the result of the conditional expression.
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, we need to consider the possible outcomes of the conditional expression.

5. **Possible Values:**
   - If `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3`, then `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)` will be 1.
   - Otherwise, it will be 0.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the sum of the integer divisions plus either 1 or 0 depending on the condition.

Given the above analysis, the output will be:

Output: **(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2) + (1 if a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3 else 0)**
