Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`. Therefore, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `p_i` is a quadruple of non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence. However, this information is not directly relevant to the loop condition.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop depends on `int(input())`, the state before the loop must ensure that `int(input())` is at least 1.
   - The value of `t` itself does not need to be adjusted because it is already given as a valid positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `int(input())` to be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, int(input()) must be at least 1**
