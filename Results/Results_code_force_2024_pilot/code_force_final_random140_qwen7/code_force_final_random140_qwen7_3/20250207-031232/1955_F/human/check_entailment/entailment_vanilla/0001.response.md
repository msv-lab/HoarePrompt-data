Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, which means we need to maximize the number of times the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. 

### Given Program Analysis
The provided function `func()` reads the input and calculates a value using the formula:
\[ \text{result} = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{b}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{c}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor + \text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 3 == 3) \]

Hereâ€™s what each part of the formula does:
1. **Floor Division**: `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, `d // 2` count how many pairs of each type of number (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s) can be removed without changing the parity (odd/even nature) of the count.
2. **Modulo Operation**: `a % 2`, `b % 2`, `c % 3` check the remaining counts modulo 2 and 3, respectively. The condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` checks if the sum of these counts, when taken modulo 3, equals 3, which would mean that removing one more number could make the XOR zero.

### Correctness Check
To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that the formula correctly maximizes the number of Bob's wins. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Floor Division**: Removing pairs of numbers ensures that the parity of the counts remains the same, thus not affecting the possibility of making the XOR zero.
2. **Modulo Operation**: The condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` ensures that the sum of the remaining counts, when taken modulo 3, is 3. This implies that there are enough odd counts to potentially make the XOR zero after removing one more number.

Given this analysis, the formula seems to correctly calculate the maximum number of Bob's wins by ensuring that the XOR remains zero as much as possible.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
