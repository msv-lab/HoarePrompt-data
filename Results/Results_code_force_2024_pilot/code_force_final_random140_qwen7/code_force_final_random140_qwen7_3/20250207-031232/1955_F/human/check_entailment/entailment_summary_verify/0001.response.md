### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. However, let's re-evaluate the program and the function summary in detail to ensure there are no overlooked details or potential issues.

#### Problem Description Recap
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins by optimally removing numbers.

#### Program Code Recap
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3))
```

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- Each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
- It calculates and prints the total count of even numbers (1s and 2s divided by 2) plus a special condition based on the remainders when dividing the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s by their respective values.

#### Detailed Analysis
1. **Floor Division (`a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, `d // 2`)**:
   - This part counts the number of pairs of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s that can be removed without changing the parity of the count.
   - For example, if there are 3 ones, `3 // 2 = 1`, meaning one pair can be removed.

2. **Modulo Operation (`a % 2`, `b % 2`, `c % 3`)**:
   - This part checks the remaining counts modulo 2 and 3.
   - The condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` ensures that the sum of these counts, when taken modulo 3, equals 3.
   - If this condition is true, it means that removing one more number could make the XOR zero.

3. **Combining Results**:
   - The formula combines the counts of even numbers and the special condition to determine the maximum number of Bob's wins.

#### Correctness Check
- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are all zero, the formula should return 0.
  - When there are no 1s, 2s, or 3s, the formula should return the number of 4s divided by 2.
  - When there are multiple odd counts, the special condition should correctly identify the optimal removal.

- **Test Cases**:
  - The provided examples match the expected outputs:
    - `1 1 1 0`: Bob wins once (`1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 3 == 3) = 1`)
    - `1 0 1 2`: Bob wins once (`1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 3 == 3) = 1`)
    - `2 2 2 0`: Bob wins three times (`2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 3 == 3) = 3`)
    - `3 3 2 0`: Bob wins three times (`3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 3 == 3) = 3`)
    - `0 9 9 9`: Bob wins twelve times (`0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + int(0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 3 == 3) = 12`)

Based on the detailed analysis and test cases, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
