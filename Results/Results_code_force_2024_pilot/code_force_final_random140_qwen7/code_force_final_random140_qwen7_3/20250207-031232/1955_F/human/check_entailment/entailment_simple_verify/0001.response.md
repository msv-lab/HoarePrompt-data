### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the problem description step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Description Recap
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

#### Given Program Recap
The function `func()` reads the input and calculates a value using the formula:
\[ \text{result} = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{b}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{c}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor + \text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 3 == 3) \]

Where:
- \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.
- The floor division terms (`// 2`) count how many pairs of each type of number can be removed without changing the parity.
- The modulo operation and condition check if the sum of the remaining counts, when taken modulo 3, equals 3.

#### Detailed Analysis
1. **Floor Division**:
   - Removing pairs of numbers ensures that the parity of the counts remains the same, thus not affecting the possibility of making the XOR zero.
   
2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` checks if the sum of the remaining counts, when taken modulo 3, equals 3. This implies that there are enough odd counts to potentially make the XOR zero after removing one more number.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` does not directly help in determining the maximum number of Bob's wins. Instead, it checks a specific condition that might not always lead to maximizing Bob's wins.
- The formula does not account for the optimal removal strategy where Eve can remove numbers to ensure the XOR remains zero for as long as possible.

#### Example Verification
Let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **Input**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Initial sequence: [1, 1, 1]
   - XOR: 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 = 1 (Alice wins)
   - After removing one number, the sequence can be [1, 1] or [1, 1] or [1], all leading to Alice still winning.
   - Output should be `0` (not `1`).

2. **Input**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Initial sequence: [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
   - XOR: 1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 0 (Bob wins)
   - After removing one number, the sequence can be [1, 1, 2, 2] or [1, 1, 2, 2] or [1, 1, 2], all leading to Bob still winning.
   - Output should be `1` (not `1`).

3. **Input**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Initial sequence: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
   - XOR: 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 = 0 (Bob wins)
   - After removing one number, the sequence can be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] or [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] or [1, 1, 1, 1], all leading to Bob still winning.
   - Output should be `2` (not `3`).

4. **Input**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Initial sequence: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
   - XOR: 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 0 (Bob wins)
   - After removing one number, the sequence can be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2] or [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2] or [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2], all leading to Bob still winning.
   - Output should be `3` (not `3`).

5. **Input**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Initial sequence: [2, 2, 2, ..., 2] (9 times)
   - XOR: 2 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ 2 = 0 (Bob wins)
   - After removing one number, the sequence can be [2, 2, 2, ..., 2] (8 times), all leading to Bob still winning.
   - Output should be `9` (not `12`).

#### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of Bob's wins. The formula used does not account for the optimal removal strategy where Eve can remove numbers to ensure the XOR remains zero for as long as possible.

**Final: False**
