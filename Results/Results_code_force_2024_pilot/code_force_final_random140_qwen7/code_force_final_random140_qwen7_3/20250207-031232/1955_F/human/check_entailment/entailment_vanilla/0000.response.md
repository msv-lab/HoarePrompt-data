Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time, aiming to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3))
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2`. 
     - `a // 2` gives the number of pairs of 1s, which contribute 0 to the XOR.
     - `b // 2` gives the number of pairs of 2s, which also contribute 0 to the XOR.
     - `c // 2` gives the number of pairs of 3s, which also contribute 0 to the XOR.
     - `d // 2` gives the number of pairs of 4s, which also contribute 0 to the XOR.
   - It then adds `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)` to this sum.
     - `a % 2` gives the parity (odd or even) of the count of 1s.
     - `b % 2` gives the parity of the count of 2s.
     - `c % 3` gives the remainder when the count of 3s is divided by 3.
     - The condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` checks if the sum of these parities equals 3.

3. **Output**:
   - The result of the above calculation is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check:

To determine if the program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win, we need to verify if the logic matches the problem statement.

- **Key Insight**: Bob wins if the final XOR of the sequence is zero. The key is to ensure that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero after each removal by Eve.
- **Parity Logic**: The expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3` helps in determining the parity of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s. If the sum is 3, it means there is an odd number of 1s and 3s combined, which can be used to balance out other numbers to make the final XOR zero.

Given the problem constraints and the logic used, the program appears to correctly calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win by ensuring the final XOR is zero through optimal removals.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of times Bob can win.

**Correctness: True**
