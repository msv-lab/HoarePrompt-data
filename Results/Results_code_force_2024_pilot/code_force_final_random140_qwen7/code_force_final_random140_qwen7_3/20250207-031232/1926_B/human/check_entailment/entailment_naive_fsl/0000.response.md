Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
5
00000
00000
01110
01010
00000
```

According to the problem description, this grid should be identified as a "TRIANGLE" because it matches the pattern of a triangle with `k=3`. However, the program will incorrectly identify this as a "Square" because it checks each row individually and finds more than one row with multiple `1`s, leading it to conclude a square is present.

To fix this, the program needs to check for both the triangle and square patterns comprehensively across the entire grid.
