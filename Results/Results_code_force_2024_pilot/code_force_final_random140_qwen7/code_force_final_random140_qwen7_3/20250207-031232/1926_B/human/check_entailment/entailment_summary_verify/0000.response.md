### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description and Function Summary Analysis:
- The problem requires identifying whether the grid contains a triangle or a square that includes all '1's and has a size greater than 1.
- The function summary states that the program checks each row individually to determine if it contains exactly one '1'. If any row has exactly one '1', it identifies the shape as a triangle. Otherwise, it identifies the shape as a square.

#### Program Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = 0
        b = ''
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'Triangle'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'Square'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
```

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Triangle Identification**:
   - The program checks each row individually and sets `a` to 'Triangle' if any row has exactly one '1'. This logic is flawed because it doesn't consider the overall structure of the grid.
   - For example, consider the grid:
     ```
     00000
     00000
     01110
     01010
     00000
     ```
     The third row has three '1's, but the fourth row has only one '1'. According to the program, this would be identified as a triangle, which is incorrect since it doesn't form a triangle pattern.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Square Identification**:
   - The program sets `b` to 'Square' if any row has more than one '1'. This logic is also flawed because it doesn't ensure that the '1's form a square pattern.
   - For example, consider the grid:
     ```
     00000
     00000
     01000
     01110
     00000
     ```
     The fourth row has four '1's, but they do not form a square pattern. The program would incorrectly identify this as a square.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly identify a triangle, we need to check if there exists a row with `2*i-1` '1's centered in one column for some `i > 1`.
- To correctly identify a square, we need to check if there exists a row with `k` '1's evenly spaced from the left edge for some `k > 1`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
