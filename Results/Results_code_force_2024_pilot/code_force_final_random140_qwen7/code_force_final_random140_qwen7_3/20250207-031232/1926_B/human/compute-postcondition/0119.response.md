Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n characters ('0' or '1'). It identifies and returns either a triangle or a square that includes all '1's in the grid, with the size of the shape being greater than 1.**

This means the function takes a grid (a list of strings) as an implicit input through its internal processing, checks for the presence of a triangle or a square that encompasses all '1's in the grid, and ensures the identified shape has a size greater than 1. It then returns the identified shape.
