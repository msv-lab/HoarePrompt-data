Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `s` is an input string.
- `j` will be equal to `n`.
- The final values of `a` and `b` depend on the counts of '1' in each input string `s`.

The conditions for `a` and `b` are:
- If no string `s` has exactly one '1', then `a` will be 'Square'.
- If no string `s` has more than one '1', then `b` will be 'Triangle'.

Since the exact strings `s` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `a` and `b`. However, the print statement only outputs `b`.

Given the conditions, `b` could be either 'Triangle' or 'Square' depending on the input strings. Since we do not have specific input strings, we can only describe the possible value of `b`.

Output: **b (where b is 'Triangle' if no string s has more than one '1', otherwise it is 'Square')**
