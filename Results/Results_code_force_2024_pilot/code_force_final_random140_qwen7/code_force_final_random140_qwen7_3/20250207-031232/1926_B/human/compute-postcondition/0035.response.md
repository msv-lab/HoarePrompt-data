Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `j` will be equal to `n`, and the final values of `a` and `b` depend on the counts of '1' in each input string `s`. If no string `s` has exactly one '1', then `a` will be 'Square'. If no string `s` has more than one '1', then `b` will be 'Triangle'. The final values of `a` and `b` will reflect the cumulative conditions from all inputs provided during the loop iterations.**
