Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `s` is an input string.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < n`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `j` is currently 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 1 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1).

5. **Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - Since `j` is 0, the loop will execute if `j < n` is true.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already given as a postcondition).

6. **Updated State:**
   - `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to execute, not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:
- `j` is 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `s` is an input string**
