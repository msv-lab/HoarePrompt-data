Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `j` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Check the given state**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string (not used in the loop).
   - `j` is equal to `n` (this is the starting value of `j` before the loop starts).
   - `a` is 0 (not used in the loop).
   - `b` is an empty string (not used in the loop).
   - `i` is `i + 1` (not used in the loop).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j` being equal to `n`, we need to ensure that `j` is set to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - We also need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
