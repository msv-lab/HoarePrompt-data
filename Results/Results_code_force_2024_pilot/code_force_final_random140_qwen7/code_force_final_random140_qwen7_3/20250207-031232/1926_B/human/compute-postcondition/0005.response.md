Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `j` is initialized to 0 by the loop itself, so no adjustment is needed for `j`.
   - The variable `n` is used as the upper limit for the range function. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Consider the Given States**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not directly related to the loop head).
   - `i` is 0 (this is not directly related to the loop head).
   - `n` is an input integer (we need to ensure it is at least 1 for the loop to execute).
   - `a` is 0 (this is not directly related to the loop head).
   - `b` is an empty string (this is not directly related to the loop head).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` is initialized to 0 by the loop itself, no adjustment is needed for `j`.
   - We need to ensure `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
