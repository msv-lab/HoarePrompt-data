Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `j` is equal to `n`, `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', `i` is `i + 1'**.

Explanation: The line `a = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `a`. The values of `n`, `s`, `j`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for setting `a` and `b` based on the string `s` is not affected by this assignment, so `b` remains 'Square' and `a` is set to 0.
