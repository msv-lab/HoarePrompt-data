Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state**:
   - `i` is `t`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0
   - `b` is 'Square'
   - `j` is 1
   - `s` is the input string

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n`.

4. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `t`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0
   - `b` is 'Square'
   - `j` is 1 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration)
   - `s` is the input string

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1, for the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

6. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is `t`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0
   - `b` is 'Square'
   - `j` is 2
   - `s` is the input string

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is 2, and `s` is the input string**
