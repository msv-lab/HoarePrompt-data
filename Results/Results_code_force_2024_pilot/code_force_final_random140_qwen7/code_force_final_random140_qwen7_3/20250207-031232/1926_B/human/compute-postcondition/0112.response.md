Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `t`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, but the current value of `a` is not 0
- `b` is 'Square'
- `j` is 2 (or any value up to `n-1`)
- `s` is the last input string

The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `a`. Since it is explicitly stated that the current value of `a` is not 0, and `a` can only be 'Triangle' or 0, the value of `a` must be 'Triangle'.

Output: **'Triangle'**
