Based on the initial state provided:

- `b` is explicitly defined as 'Square'.
- `i` is `t`, but the value of `t` is not specified, so it doesn't affect the print statement.
- `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.
- `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, but it is not relevant to the print statement.
- `j` is 2 (or any value up to `n-1`), but again, this doesn't affect the print statement.
- `s` is the last input string, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is simply printing the value of `b`, which is 'Square'.

Output: **Square**
