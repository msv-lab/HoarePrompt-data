Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `j` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 'Square', `b` is 'Square'**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 'Square' to the variable `b`. The values of `n`, `s`, `j`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
