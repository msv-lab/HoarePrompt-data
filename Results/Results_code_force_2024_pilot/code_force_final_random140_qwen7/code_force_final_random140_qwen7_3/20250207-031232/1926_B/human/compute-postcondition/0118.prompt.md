Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and is set to the input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'Triangle'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'Square'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `j` will be equal to `n`, `a` will be 'Triangle' if any string `s` has exactly one '1', otherwise `a` will be 'Square', `b` will be 'Square' if any string `s` has more than one '1', otherwise `b` will be 'Triangle'. The final values of `a` and `b` will reflect the cumulative conditions from all inputs provided during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n-1`, `s` is an input string from the user for each iteration of the loop, and `b` is set based on the count of '1' in `s` for each iteration. If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, then `b` is set to 'Triangle' for that particular iteration. Otherwise, `b` is set to 'Square' for that particular iteration. The final value of `b` will be 'Triangle' if there was at least one iteration where `s.count('1')` was exactly 1, otherwise, it will be 'Square' if there was at least one iteration where `s.count('1')` was greater than 1. The variable `a` retains its last assigned value, which could be 'Triangle' if any string `s` contained exactly one '1', or it remains 0 if no such string was encountered.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is 2 (or any value up to `n-1`), and `s` is the last input string. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is set to 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` remains either 'Triangle' or 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
