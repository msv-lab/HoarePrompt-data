Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `j` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, then `a` is 'Triangle', otherwise `a` is 'Square'. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, then `a` is 'Square' and `b` is 'Square'.
