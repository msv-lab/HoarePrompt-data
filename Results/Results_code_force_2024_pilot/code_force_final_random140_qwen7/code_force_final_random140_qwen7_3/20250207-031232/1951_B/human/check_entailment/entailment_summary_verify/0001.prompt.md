You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        wins += 1
    if wins >= k:
        print(wins - 1)
    wins_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        wins_with_swap += 1
    print(max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `a` and two indices `k` and `n` to determine the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to the `k-1`th element. It calculates two values: `wins`, which counts the number of elements less than or equal to `a[k-1]` without considering a potential swap, and `wins_with_swap`, which considers a hypothetical swap. The function then prints the maximum of two values: `wins - 1` and `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Defining Function:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - `func_1()` reads the number of cows `n` and the index of the cow `k`.
   - It also reads the ratings of the cows into a list `a`.

2. **Initial Calculation of Wins Without Swap:**
   - The program iterates through the list `a` and counts how many cows have a rating greater than `a[k-1]`.
   - This count is stored in `wins`.
   - If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `wins - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `0`.

3. **Calculation of Wins With Swap:**
   - The program calculates the potential wins if the cow at position `k-1` is swapped with another cow.
   - It starts from `wins + 1` and iterates through the list `a` to count how many cows have a rating greater than `a[k-1]` starting from this position.
   - This count is stored in `wins_with_swap`.
   - The program then calculates the maximum wins considering the swap and prints the result.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initial Calculation (`wins`):**
   - The logic to calculate `wins` is correct. It counts the number of cows with a higher rating before the cow at position `k-1`.
   - However, this calculation alone might not give the maximum wins if we consider swapping.

2. **Swap Calculation (`wins_with_swap`):**
   - The logic to calculate `wins_with_swap` is also correct. It counts the number of cows with a higher rating starting from the position where the cow at `k-1` would be placed after a swap.
   - The final result is calculated correctly by comparing the wins without swap and with swap.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Test Case 1:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  6 1
  12 10 14 11 8 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Actual Output:
  - `wins = 1` (since only the cow at position 2 has a higher rating).
  - `wins_with_swap = 1` (since the cow at position 2 still has a higher rating after the swap).
  - Result: `max(1 - 1, 1 - 1 - 1 + (1 > 0)) = 0` (incorrect).

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  6 5
  7 2 727 10 12 13
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Actual Output:
  - `wins = 2` (since the cows at positions 3 and 4 have higher ratings).
  - `wins_with_swap = 3` (since the cow at position 3 has a higher rating after the swap).
  - Result: `max(2 - 1, 3 - 2 - 1 + (2 > 0)) = 2` (correct).

### Conclusion

The program seems to have a logical error in the calculation of the maximum wins when considering the swap. Specifically, the formula used to compute the maximum wins after a swap is incorrect. The correct approach should ensure that the swap maximizes the number of wins.

### Correctness

Based on the analysis, the program is **not** correct due to the incorrect calculation of the maximum wins after a swap.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
