Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `wins_with_swap`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 9.
   - `wins_with_swap` is initially set to 4.
   - `k` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is used in the range function. For the loop to start, `k` must be greater than `wins_with_swap`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to start**:
   - The loop will start if `wins_with_swap <= i < k - 1`.
   - Given `i = 9` and `wins_with_swap = 4`, we need to ensure that `k - 1 > 9` or equivalently `k > 10`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is within the range defined by `wins_with_swap` and `k - 1`.
   - Since `i` is already 9, we need to ensure that `wins_with_swap` is less than or equal to 9 and `k` is greater than 10.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i`, `wins_with_swap`, and `k`.

**Final State**:
State: **`wins` is 3, `wins_with_swap` is 4, `i` is 9, `k` must be greater than 10**
