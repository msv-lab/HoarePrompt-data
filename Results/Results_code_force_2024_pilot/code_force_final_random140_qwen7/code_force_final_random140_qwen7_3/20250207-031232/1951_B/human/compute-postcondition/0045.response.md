Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing data through variables t, n, k, and a, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n and k are integers with 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a is a list of n distinct integers each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function processes these inputs to produce an output based on the given conditions.**
