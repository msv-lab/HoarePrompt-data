Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `wins` has been increased by 1 (though `wins` is not directly involved in the loop), `i` is 0, and `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 0, `n` must be greater than 0 (which it already is, as `n` must be at least 1).

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to update the value of `i` to 1 (since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration) and ensure that `n` remains at least 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`wins` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
