Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n;** 

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state but not affected by the code execution.
