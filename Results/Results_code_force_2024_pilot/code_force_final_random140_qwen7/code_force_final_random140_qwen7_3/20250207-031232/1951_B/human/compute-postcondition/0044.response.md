Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `wins` is 3.
   - `wins_with_swap` is 100000.
   - `i` is 100009.
   - `k` is greater than 10.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   The expression to be evaluated is:
   \[
   \text{max}( \text{wins} - 1, \text{wins\_with\_swap} - \text{wins} - 1 + (\text{wins} > 0))
   \]

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - `wins` is 3.
   - `wins_with_swap` is 100000.
   - `wins > 0` is `True`, so `(\text{wins} > 0)` evaluates to 1.

4. **Evaluate the Expression:**
   - First part: `wins - 1` is `3 - 1` which equals `2`.
   - Second part: `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (\text{wins} > 0)` is `100000 - 3 - 1 + 1` which simplifies to `100000 - 3` which equals `99997`.

5. **Determine the Maximum Value:**
   - We need to find the maximum of `2` and `99997`.
   - Clearly, `99997` is greater than `2`.

Therefore, the expression evaluates to `99997`.

Output: **99997**
