Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `wins` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `i` is 1.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value of 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` determines whether the loop continues. Since we do not have the exact value of `n`, we assume that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to continue. However, since we are breaking out of the loop, `n` must be such that the loop would have continued if `i` was 2. This implies `n` must be at least 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`wins` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**
