You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 3, `i` is 9, and `n` is 10^5.
    #
    #Explanation: Given that the loop runs for 3 iterations, it means that the condition `a[i] > a[k - 1]` was never met for any of the first 3 indices `i`. Therefore, `wins` was incremented by 1 for each iteration up to 3 times. After 3 iterations, the loop variable `i` would be equal to 3 (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time). However, since the problem specifies the upper limit for `n` as \(10^5\), and no information suggests that the loop would terminate before reaching this limit, we assume that the loop would continue to run until it reaches its maximum value of `n-1`, which is \(10^5 - 1 = 99999\) if `n` were set to \(10^5\). Thus, `i` would be 9 if we consider the loop running up to the third iteration and then continuing to its maximum possible value under the given constraints. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `k`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: 2
    #State: `wins` is 3, `i` is 9, and `n` is 10^5. Additionally, the condition `wins` is greater than or equal to `k` holds true.
    wins_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 3, `wins_with_swap` is 100000, `i` is 100009, `k` is greater than 10.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `wins_with_swap` as long as `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`. Given that `wins_with_swap` starts at 4 and increases by 1 each iteration, it will reach 100000 after 100000 - 4 = 99996 iterations. Since `i` starts at 9 and increments by 1 each iteration, it will be 9 + 99996 = 100005. However, the loop condition checks `range(wins_with_swap, k - 1)`, so once `i` reaches `k - 1`, the loop will terminate. Given that `k` is greater than 10, the final value of `i` will be `k - 1`, which is 100009 (if `k` is 100019, for example).
    print(max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)))
    #This is printed: 99997
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing data through variables t, n, k, and a, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n and k are integers with 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a is a list of n distinct integers each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function processes these inputs to produce an output based on the given conditions.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
