Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x + 2`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is now `[ans, x // i]`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[ans, x // i]`**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(l)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum value in the list `l`. Since `l` is `[ans, x // i]`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `x // i`. The values of `x`, `n`, `i`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
