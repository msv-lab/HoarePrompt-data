Output State: **`x` is an integer equal to the first input, `n` is an integer equal to the second input, `i` is `x`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. None of the other variables (`x`, `n`, `i`, `k`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from their initial states.
