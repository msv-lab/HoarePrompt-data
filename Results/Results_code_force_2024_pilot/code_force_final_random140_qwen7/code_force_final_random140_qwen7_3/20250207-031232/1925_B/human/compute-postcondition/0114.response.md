Postcondition: `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x + 1`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` with `i` appended to the list, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.
