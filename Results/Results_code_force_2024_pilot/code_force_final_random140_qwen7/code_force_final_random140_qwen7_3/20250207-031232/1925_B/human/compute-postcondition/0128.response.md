Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `n` is an integer.
- `i` is defined as `x + (int(x))`.

Given this information, let's break down the code snippet:

```python
print(ans)
```

The variable `ans` is not defined in the provided initial state. Since there is no explicit definition or assignment for `ans`, it is impossible to determine its value from the given information.

Therefore, the output cannot be determined with the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is undefined)**
