Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers using the `map` function. These values are then assigned to `x` and `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
