Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is 1, `x % i` equals 0, `l` is `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code appends `x // i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is equal to `x` and the condition `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` is true, the list `l` is updated to include `x // i`. Since `l` was initially `[1, i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, after appending `x // i`, the list becomes `[1, i, x // i]`.
