Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x + 2`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is now `[ans, x // i]`**.

Explanation: The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Since `l` was previously `[ans, i]`, after appending `x // i`, the updated list `l` becomes `[ans, i, x // i]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
