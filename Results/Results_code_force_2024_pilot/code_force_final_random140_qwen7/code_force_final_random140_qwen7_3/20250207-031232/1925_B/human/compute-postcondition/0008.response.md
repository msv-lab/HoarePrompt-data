Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is a non-negative integer such that `int(x) % 1 == 0`, `l` is a list containing two elements which are `ans` and `2`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `l`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables (`x` and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` becomes 2, and `l` now contains `ans` and the new value of `i` which is 2.
