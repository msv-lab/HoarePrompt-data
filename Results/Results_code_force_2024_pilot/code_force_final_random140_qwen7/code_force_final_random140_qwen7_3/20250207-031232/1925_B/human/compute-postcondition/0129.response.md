Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be a non-negative integer, `n` will be an integer, `i` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `k` will be `x // n`, `l` will be a list containing the maximum values found for each divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `ans` will hold the highest value found in `l`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `x` remains a non-negative integer, `n` is the integer obtained from input, `i` is one more than the integer part of the square root of `x`, `k` is the integer result of dividing `x` by `n`, `l` contains the maximum values of `x` divided by each of its divisors up to `k`, and `ans` holds the highest value found in `l`.
