Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `l` is a list containing the elements `max(x // 2, 1)` and `x // 3`, `ans` is `max(x // 2, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `ans = max(l)` assigns the maximum value between the two elements in list `l` to `ans`. Since `l` contains `ans` (which is the maximum of `x // 2` and 1) and `x // 3`, `ans` will be the maximum of these two values. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `i`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
