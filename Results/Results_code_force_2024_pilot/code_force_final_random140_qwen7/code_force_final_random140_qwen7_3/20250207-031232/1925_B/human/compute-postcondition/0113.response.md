Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x + 1`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, and if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` has appended `i`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = max(l)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum value in the list `l`. Since `l` contains the value of `ans` and potentially the value of `i` (if `i` was less than or equal to `k`), `ans` now holds the maximum value among these elements. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
