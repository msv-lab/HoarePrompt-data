Output State: **The final value of `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x + (int(x ** 0.5) + 1)`, `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is the maximum value found during the loop iterations among the values 1, `i`, and `x // i` whenever `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will still be a non-negative integer, `n` will remain the same integer it was initialized as, `i` will be set to `x` plus the total number of iterations (`int(x ** 0.5) + 1`), `k` will be `x` divided by `n`, and `ans` will hold the highest value among 1, the current `i`, and `x // i` whenever `i` does not exceed `k`.
