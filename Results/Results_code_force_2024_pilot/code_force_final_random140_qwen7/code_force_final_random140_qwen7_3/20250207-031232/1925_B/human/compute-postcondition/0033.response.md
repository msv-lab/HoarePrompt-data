Output State: **`i` is 3 or 4, `x` is a non-negative integer, `l` is `[ans, i, x // i]`, where `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `x // i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` is defined as `[ans, i]`, where `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`. After appending `x // i`, the list `l` becomes `[ans, i, x // i]`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `x // i`.
