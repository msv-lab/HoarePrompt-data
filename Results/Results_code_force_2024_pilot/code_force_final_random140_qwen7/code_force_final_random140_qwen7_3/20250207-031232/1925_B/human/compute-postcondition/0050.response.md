Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and 1.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `l`. After appending, the value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables (`x`, `n`, and `l`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being 2 and `l` now containing both `ans` and 1.
