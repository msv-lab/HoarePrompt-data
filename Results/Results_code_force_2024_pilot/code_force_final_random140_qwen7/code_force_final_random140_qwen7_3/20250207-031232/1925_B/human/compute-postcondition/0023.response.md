Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `x` is a non-negative integer; `l` is a list containing `[max(ans, x // i), i]`**.

Explanation: The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` (integer division of `x` by `i`) to the list `l`. Since `l` initially contains `[ans, i]` where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in the list, after appending `x // i`, `l` becomes `[max(ans, x // i), i]`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
