Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x + 2`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is appended to the list `l` and `ans` remains the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is now `[ans, i]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is already defined as `x + 2`, and `l` initially contains only the value of `ans`. After appending `i` to `l`, the list `l` now contains both `ans` and `i`.
