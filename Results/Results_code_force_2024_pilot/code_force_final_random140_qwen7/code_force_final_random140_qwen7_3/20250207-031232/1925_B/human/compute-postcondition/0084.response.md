Output State: `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `l` is a list containing the maximum values found for each divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, where `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is the maximum value among all the elements in `l`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` remains a non-negative integer, `n` is the integer obtained from input, `i` is one more than the integer part of the square root of `x`, `l` contains the maximum values of `x` divided by each of its divisors up to `k`, and `ans` holds the highest value found in `l`.
