Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is either 1 or 2, `x // i` will be either `x` (if `i` is 1) or `x // 2` (if `i` is 2). The value of `x // i` is added to the list `l`, which initially contains `ans` and possibly the element 1. If `i` becomes 2, the list `l` will contain an additional element 1, but since the value of `i` is checked before appending, the list will only contain one additional 1 if `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
