Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x + 1`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `l` with the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is determined by the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The values of `x`, `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.
