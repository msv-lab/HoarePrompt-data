Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^3), followed by pairs of positive integers \( x \) and \( n \) (1 ≤ \( x \) ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ \( x \)). For each pair \( x \) and \( n \), it calculates and prints the maximum value among 1, any divisor \( i \) of \( x \) where \( i \leq x/n \), and any divisor \( x/i \) of \( x \) where \( x/i \leq x/n \).**
