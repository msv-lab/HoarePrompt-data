Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and the expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (since the range function starts from 1).
   - **Expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`**: This expression determines the upper limit of the loop. For the loop to execute, this value must be at least 1.

3. **Check the Current State**:
   - `x` is an integer equal to the first input.
   - `n` is an integer equal to the second input.
   - `i` is `x`.
   - `k` is `x // n`.
   - `ans` is 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is already set to `x`, it satisfies the initial condition for the loop.
   - We need to ensure that `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` is at least 1. This means `x ** 0.5` must be non-negative, and since `x` is an integer, `x` itself must be non-negative.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:

- Ensure `x` is non-negative (since `x ** 0.5` must be defined and non-negative).

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is 1**
