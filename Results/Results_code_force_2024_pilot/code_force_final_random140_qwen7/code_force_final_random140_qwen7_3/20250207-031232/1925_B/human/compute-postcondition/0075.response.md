Postcondition: `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `l` is a list containing the element `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value between `x // 2` and 1 if `x % 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains the same. This holds true regardless of whether `i <= k` is true or false, as the else part is not specified and thus does not change the state.
