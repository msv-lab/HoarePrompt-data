Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x + 1`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, and `l` has appended `i`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is `x + 1`) to the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
