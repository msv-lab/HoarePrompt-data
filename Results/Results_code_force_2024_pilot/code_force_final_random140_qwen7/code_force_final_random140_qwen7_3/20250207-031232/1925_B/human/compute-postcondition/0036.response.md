Output State: **`i` is 3 or 4, `x` is a non-negative integer, `l` is `[max(ans, x // i), i]`, `ans` is equal to `max(ans, x // i)`**.

Explanation: The code `ans = max(l)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum value between the current `ans` and the value of `x // i`. Since `l` is `[ans, i]`, the new value of `ans` will be the maximum of the original `ans` and `x // i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
