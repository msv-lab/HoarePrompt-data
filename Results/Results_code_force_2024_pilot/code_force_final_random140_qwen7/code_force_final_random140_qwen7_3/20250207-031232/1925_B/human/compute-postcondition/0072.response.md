Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. The variable `i` is being iterated over the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is a non-negative integer.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `l` is a list containing the elements `ans`, 2, and `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value between `x // 2` and 1 if `x % 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains the same.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.

4. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is still within this range for the next iteration.

5. **Determine the Value of `n`**:
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop head. It remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **List `l`**:
   - The list `l` does not change within the loop head either. It remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans`, 2, and `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value between `x // 2` and 1 if `x % 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains the same.**
