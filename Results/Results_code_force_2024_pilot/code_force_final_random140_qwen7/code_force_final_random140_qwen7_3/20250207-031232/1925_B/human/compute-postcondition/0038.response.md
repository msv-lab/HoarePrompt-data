Postcondition: `i` is either 3 or 4, `x` is a non-negative integer, `l` is `[max(ans, x // i), i]`, and `ans` is equal to `max(ans, x // i)`. If `x % i == 0`, then `x` is divisible by `i` and `l` is updated to `[max(ans, x // i), i]`. If `x % i != 0`, then `l` remains as `[max(ans, x // i), i]` and `ans` remains unchanged.
