Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each t, it processes pairs of positive integers x and n (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x). For each pair, it returns a value based on the relationship between x and n.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a value of t, followed by pairs of x and n. It does not accept x and n directly but processes them within the context of each test case defined by t. The exact nature of the return value based on x and n is not specified here, but it implies some form of comparison or calculation involving x and n for each test case.
