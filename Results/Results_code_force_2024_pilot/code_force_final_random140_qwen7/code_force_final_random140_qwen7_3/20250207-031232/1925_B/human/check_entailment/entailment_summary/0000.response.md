Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum balance (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.

### Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading \( x \) and \( n \).

2. **Initial Calculation**: 
   - It calculates \( k = x // n \), which is the minimum difficulty per sub-problem if the problems were evenly distributed.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the smallest possible GCD.

3. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates over potential divisors \( i \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} + 1 \).
   - For each divisor \( i \), it checks if \( i \) divides \( x \) without a remainder.
   - If \( i \) is a divisor, it considers both \( i \) and \( x // i \) as potential difficulties for the sub-problems.
   - It updates `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans` and the considered divisors.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum balance found for each test case.

### Correctness Check:

- **Divisors Consideration**: The program correctly considers all divisors of \( x \) up to \( \sqrt{x} \). This ensures that all possible ways to split \( x \) into \( n \) parts are considered.
- **Max GCD Calculation**: By considering both \( i \) and \( x // i \), the program ensures that the maximum possible GCD is found.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - When \( x \) is prime, the only divisors are 1 and \( x \), so the maximum GCD is 1.
  - When \( x \) is a perfect square, the largest divisor less than or equal to \( x // n \) is considered.
  - The program handles the case when \( x \) is not divisible by \( n \) correctly by considering the largest possible divisors.

Given the logic and the approach, the program appears to correctly compute the maximum balance for each test case.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
