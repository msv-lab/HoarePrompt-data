You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers \(x\) and \(n\). For each test case, it calculates the maximum integer \(i\) such that \(x - n \cdot i \geq 0\) and both \(x - n \cdot i\) and \(i\) are divisible by \(i\). It then prints this maximum value for each test case. The function reads the number of test cases from the first line of input, followed by pairs of integers \(x\) and \(n\) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the GCD, we need to ensure that the difficulties of the sub-problems are as evenly distributed as possible while still summing to `x`. This means finding the largest divisor of `x` that can be evenly divided among `n` sub-problems.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over possible divisors of `x` using `sqrt(x)` to optimize the search.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     1. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, meaning we can distribute `i` among `n` sub-problems with some remainder.
     2. If `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, meaning we can distribute `(x // i)` among `n` sub-problems with no remainder.
   - It updates `ans` with the maximum GCD found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `x` is divisible by `n` directly by checking `(x // i)`.
   - It also ensures that the remaining part after distribution is still divisible by the current divisor `i`.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the largest possible GCD by iterating through potential divisors and ensuring the sum condition is met.
   - The use of `sqrt(x)` helps in reducing the number of iterations needed, making the solution efficient.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the problemset.
