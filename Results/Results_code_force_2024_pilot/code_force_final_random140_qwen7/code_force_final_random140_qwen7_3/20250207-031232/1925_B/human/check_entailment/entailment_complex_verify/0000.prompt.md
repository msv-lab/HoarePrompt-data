You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = x // n
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be a non-negative integer, `n` will be an integer, `i` will be `int(x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^3), followed by pairs of positive integers \( x \) and \( n \) (1 ≤ \( x \) ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ \( x \)). For each pair \( x \) and \( n \), it calculates and prints the maximum value among 1, any divisor \( i \) of \( x \) where \( i \leq x/n \), and any divisor \( x/i \) of \( x \) where \( x/i \leq x/n \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the maximum balance of the problemset by breaking down the total difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems. The approach taken is to find the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `x // n` and then determine the maximum divisor among them. This method ensures that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x` and maximizes the GCD (balance).

Let's verify the program against the given examples:

1. For the first test case (10, 3):
   - Possible sub-problems could be (4, 2, 4), (5, 5), etc.
   - The program calculates the maximum divisor of 10 that is less than or equal to 10 // 3 ≈ 3, which is 2.
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

2. For the second test case (5, 5):
   - The only way to split 5 into 5 sub-problems is (1, 1, 1, 1, 1).
   - The program calculates the maximum divisor of 5 that is less than or equal to 5 // 5 = 1, which is 1.
   - Output: 1 (Correct)

3. For the third test case (420, 69):
   - The program calculates the maximum divisor of 420 that is less than or equal to 420 // 69 ≈ 6.
   - The largest divisor of 420 that is ≤ 6 is 6.
   - Output: 6 (Correct)

Since the program handles all given examples correctly and the logic seems sound for finding the maximum balance, the program is correct.
