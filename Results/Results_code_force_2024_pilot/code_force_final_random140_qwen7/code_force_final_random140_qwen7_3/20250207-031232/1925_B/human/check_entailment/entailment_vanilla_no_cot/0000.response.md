Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Calculation**: It calculates `k` as `x // n`, which represents the minimum difficulty per sub-problem if the problems were evenly distributed.
3. **Finding Maximum GCD**: The program then iterates through possible divisors of `x` to find the maximum GCD that can be achieved while ensuring the sum of the difficulties equals `x`. This is done by checking both `i` and `x // i` as potential GCD values.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. The program handles edge cases well, such as when `x` is not perfectly divisible by `n`, and it efficiently finds the maximum possible GCD for the given constraints.
