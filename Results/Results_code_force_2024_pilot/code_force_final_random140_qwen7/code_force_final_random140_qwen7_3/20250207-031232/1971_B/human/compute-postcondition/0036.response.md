Output State: **`i` is length_of_string + 1, `cnt_test_cases` remains the same as before, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 0**.

The code initializes `k` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `cnt_test_cases`, `string`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
