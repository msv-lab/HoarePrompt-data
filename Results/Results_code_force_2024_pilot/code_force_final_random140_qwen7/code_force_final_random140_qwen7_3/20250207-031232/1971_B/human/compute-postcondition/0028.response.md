Given the initial state:
- `i` is equal to the length of `string`.
- `k` is equal to the number of times `m` appears in `string`.
- The number of times `m` appears in `string` is not equal to the length of `string`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(''.join(sorted(string)))`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `string` is a sequence of characters.
2. `i` is the length of `string`, meaning `i = len(string)`.
3. `k` is the count of the character `m` in `string`.
4. Since `k` is not equal to `i`, `m` does not appear the same number of times as the length of `string`.

The `sorted(string)` function sorts the characters in `string` alphabetically. The `join` method then concatenates these sorted characters into a single string.

Since the exact content of `string` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact printed output. However, we know it will be a string consisting of the characters in `string` sorted alphabetically.

Output: **a string consisting of the characters in `string` sorted alphabetically**
