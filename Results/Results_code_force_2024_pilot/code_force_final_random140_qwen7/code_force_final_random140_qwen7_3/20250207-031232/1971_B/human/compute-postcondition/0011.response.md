Output State: **`i` is 0; `k` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `k` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 0, making `k` equal to 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0 since no operation was performed on it. The precondition that `len(string)` must be at least 1 and the current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m` remains valid.
