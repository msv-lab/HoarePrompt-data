Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(cnt_test_cases)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `cnt_test_cases`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < cnt_test_cases`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to the length of `string`.
   - `k` is equal to the number of times `m` appears in `string`.
   - If `k` equals the length of `string`, then `m` appears as many times as the length of the string. Otherwise, `k` does not equal the length of `string`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to the length of `string`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but based on the given information, it is assumed to remain the same.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `length_of_string + 1`.
   - `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is length_of_string + 1, `cnt_test_cases` is the same as before**.
