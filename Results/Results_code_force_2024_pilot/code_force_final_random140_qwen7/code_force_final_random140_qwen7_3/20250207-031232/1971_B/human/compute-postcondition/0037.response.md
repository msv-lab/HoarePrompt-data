Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(string)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `length_of_string + 1`.
   - The expression `len(string)` gives the length of the string `string`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `i` is less than `len(string)`. 

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be less than `len(string)`.
   - Given that `i` is initially set to `length_of_string + 1`, this value is one more than the length of the string. Therefore, `i` will not be less than `len(string)` initially, and the loop will not execute.

5. **State the necessary adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be adjusted to a value less than `len(string)`. Since `i` is currently `length_of_string + 1`, we need to reduce its value to be within the range `[0, len(string))`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

**State:**
**`i` is length_of_string, `cnt_test_cases` remains the same as before, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 0**
