Postcondition: **After executing the if-else block, `string` remains the same as the initial input string, `i` is equal to the length of `string`, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string`. If `k` equals the length of `string`, the function does nothing additional. Otherwise, `k` is simply the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string`.**
