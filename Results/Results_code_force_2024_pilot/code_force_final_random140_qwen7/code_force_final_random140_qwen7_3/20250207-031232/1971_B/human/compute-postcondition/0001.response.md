Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `cnt_test_cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `cnt_test_cases` is given as an input integer.
   - `i` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `cnt_test_cases`.
   - Initially, `i` is 0, so the loop will execute as long as `cnt_test_cases` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `cnt_test_cases` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - The variables `t` and `s` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt_test_cases` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0**
