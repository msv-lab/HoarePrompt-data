Output State: **`i` is length_of_string + 1, `cnt_test_cases` remains the same as before, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first character of the string to the variable `m`. Since the string has already been stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` will be the first non-whitespace character of the string. The other variables (`i` and `cnt_test_cases`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
