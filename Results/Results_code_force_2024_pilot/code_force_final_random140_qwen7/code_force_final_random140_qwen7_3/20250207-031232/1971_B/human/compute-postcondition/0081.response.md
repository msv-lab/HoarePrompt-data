Based on the initial state provided:

- `string` is the same as the initial input string.
- `i` is equal to the length of `string`.
- `m` is the first character of `string`.
- `k` is the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string`.
- `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(''.join(sorted(string)))
```

This code sorts the characters in `string` alphabetically and then joins them into a single string without any separators.

Given that `k` is not equal to the length of `string`, it means that the first character `m` does not occur the same number of times as the length of the string. This implies that `string` contains at least one character other than `m`.

Therefore, the sorted version of `string` will be a string where the characters are in alphabetical order.

Output: **sorted version of the input string**
