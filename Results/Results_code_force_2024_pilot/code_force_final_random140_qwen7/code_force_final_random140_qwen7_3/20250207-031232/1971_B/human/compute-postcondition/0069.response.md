Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `len(string)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(string)`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `string` is a string.
   - `i` is an index within the string.
   - `m` is a character.
   - `k` is increased by 1 if `string[i]` equals `m`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will be one more than its value at the start of the current iteration.
   - The value of `string`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged unless `string[i]` equals `m`, but since we are adjusting the state for the next iteration, we assume no change in these values unless explicitly stated otherwise.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `len(string)` remains the same because it is a property of the string and does not change during the loop execution.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`string` is a string, `i` is an index within the string (one more than the previous value), `m` is a character, and `k` is increased by 1 if `string[i]` equals `m`. If `string[i]` does not equal `m`, the values of `string`, `i`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.**
