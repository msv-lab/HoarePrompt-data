Output State: **`string` is a string, `i` is an index within the string (i + 1), `m` is a character, `k` is increased by 1**.

The code `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify a specific value for `k`, it is simply stated that `k` is increased by 1. The other variables (`string`, `i`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
