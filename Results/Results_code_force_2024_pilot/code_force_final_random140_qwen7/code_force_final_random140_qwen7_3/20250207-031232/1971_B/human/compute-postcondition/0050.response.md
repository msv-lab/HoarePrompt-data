Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `string` is a string, `i` is an index within the string (i.e., `len(string)`), `m` is a character, and `k` is increased by 1 for each occurrence of `m` in `string`. The value of `k` will be the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string `string`.

This means that `i` will be equal to `len(string)`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations over the entire length of the string. The variable `k` will hold the total count of how many times the character `m` appears in the string `string`.
