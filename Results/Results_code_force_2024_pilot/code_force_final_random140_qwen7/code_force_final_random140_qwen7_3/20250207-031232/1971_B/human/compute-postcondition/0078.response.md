Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `string` is the same as the initial input string.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `string`.
   - `m` is the first character of `string`.
   - `k` is the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string`.
   - `k` is equal to the length of `string`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Since `k` is explicitly stated to be equal to the length of `string`, it means that the number of times the first character `m` appears in `string` is equal to the length of the entire string. This implies that every character in the string is the same as the first character `m`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('No')`.

Given this analysis, the print statement will simply output the string "No".

Output: **No**
