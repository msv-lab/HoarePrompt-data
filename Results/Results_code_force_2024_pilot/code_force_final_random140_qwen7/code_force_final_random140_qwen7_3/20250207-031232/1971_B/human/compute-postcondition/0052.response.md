Based on the initial state provided:

- `string` is a string.
- `i` is equal to the length of `string`.
- `m` is a character.
- `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`.
- `k` is equal to the length of `string`.

Given these conditions, since `k` is explicitly stated to be equal to the length of `string`, and `k` is also defined as the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`, it implies that every character in `string` must be `m`. Therefore, the length of `string` (`i`) must be equal to the number of times `m` appears in `string` (`k`).

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`, regardless of the values of `i`, `m`, and `k`.

Output: **No**
