Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given code are `i`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range from `0` to `len(string) - 1`.
3. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `string` is a string.
   - `i` is an index within the string (i + 1).
   - `m` is a character.
   - `k` is increased by 1 if `string[i]` equals `m`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `k` will remain unchanged unless `string[i]` equals `m`.

Given the above points, let's formulate the new state:

- `string` remains the same.
- `i` will be `i + 1` (since it is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration).
- `m` remains the same.
- `k` remains unchanged unless `string[i]` (which becomes `string[i+1]` in the next iteration) equals `m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`string` is a string, `i` is an index within the string (i + 2), `m` is a character, and `k` is increased by 1 if `string[i+1]` equals `m`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.**
