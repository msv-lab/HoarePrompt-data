Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is set to `length_of_string + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(len(string))`. This means `i` will iterate from `0` to `len(string) - 1`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `0` to `len(string) - 1`. Given that `i` is initially set to `length_of_string + 1`, this value is greater than `len(string)` (since `length_of_string` is the number of characters in the string, and adding 1 makes it one more than the maximum valid index).

5. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is initially set to a value that would prevent the loop from executing, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is within the valid range.

Given these steps, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is within the range `0` to `len(string) - 1`. 

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `i` is within the valid range, and the other variables (`string`, `m`, and `k`) remain as they are since they are not involved in the loop condition.

**State:**
**`i` must be between 0 and len(string) - 1, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 0**
