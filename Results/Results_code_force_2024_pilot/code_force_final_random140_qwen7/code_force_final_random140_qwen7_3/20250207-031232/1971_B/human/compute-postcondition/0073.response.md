Output State: **`string` is a string, `i` is one more than the previous value, `m` is a character, `k` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. The values of `string`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes that `k` is increased by 1.
