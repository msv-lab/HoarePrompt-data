You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        m = string[0]
        k = 0
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (the number of test cases) and a string `s` (of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters). For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains more than one distinct character. If `s` consists of only one character repeated throughout, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string `s`. After processing all test cases, it outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each case, and the sorted string if applicable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not generate a new string `r` that is different from the input string `s`. Instead, it checks if all characters in the string are the same and prints "No" if they are, otherwise it prints "Yes" followed by the sorted version of the string. This approach fails to meet the requirement of generating a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.

For example, consider the input string "aaa":
- The program will sort the string to get "aaa".
- Since the sorted string is the same as the original string, it will print "No".

However, according to the problem description, for a string like "aaa", we should be able to generate a new string that is different from "aaa". For instance, "aab" would be a valid output since it is a rearrangement of "aaa" and is not equal to "aaa".

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality and hence is incorrect.
