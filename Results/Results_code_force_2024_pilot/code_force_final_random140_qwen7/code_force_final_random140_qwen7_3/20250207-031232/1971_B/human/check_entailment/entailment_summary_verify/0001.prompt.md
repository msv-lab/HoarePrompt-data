You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        m = string[0]
        k = 0
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (the number of test cases) and a string `s` (of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters). For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains more than one distinct character. If `s` consists of only one character repeated throughout, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string `s`. After processing all test cases, it outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each case, and the sorted string if applicable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cnt_test_cases`) and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Single Character String Handling:**
   - If the length of the string is 1, the program prints 'No', which is correct because there are no other permutations of a single character string.

3. **Checking for All Characters Being the Same:**
   - The program checks if all characters in the string are the same by comparing the first character (`m`) with every other character in the string. This is done using a loop.
   - If all characters are the same, the program prints 'No', which is correct because there are no other permutations of a string where all characters are identical.

4. **Generating a Permutation:**
   - If the string has more than one distinct character, the program prints 'Yes' and then sorts the string to generate a new permutation.
   - Sorting the string ensures that a different permutation is generated unless the string is already sorted, which would happen if all characters were the same (but this case is already handled).

### Issues Identified:
- The program does not handle the case where the string has exactly two distinct characters but the number of occurrences of each character is the same. For example, the string "aaabbb" should have a valid permutation like "ababab". However, the current implementation will sort the string to "aaabbb" and print it, which is not a valid permutation since it is the same as the original string.

### Example:
- For the string "aaabbb", the program will print "Yes" followed by "aaabbb", which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is not fully correct because it fails to generate a valid permutation when the string has more than one distinct character and the count of each character is the same.

### Correctness:
**False**
