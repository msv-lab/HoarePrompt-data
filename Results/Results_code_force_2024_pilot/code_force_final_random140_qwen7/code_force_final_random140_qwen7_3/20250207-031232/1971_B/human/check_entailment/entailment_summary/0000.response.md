Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program checks if the string consists of only one distinct character. This is done by comparing the first character with all other characters in the string.
3. If the string has only one distinct character, the program correctly prints "No".
4. If the string has more than one distinct character, the program prints "Yes" followed by the sorted version of the string.
5. The program handles all test cases as specified in the problem statement, including edge cases like strings with a single character or strings where all characters are the same.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
