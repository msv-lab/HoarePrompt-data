You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for j in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of arrows in a grid. It checks for specific conditions at odd indices and prints 'NO' if any condition is met, otherwise it prints 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, the length of the grid.
   - It then reads two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program iterates through every odd-indexed column (i.e., columns 1, 3, 5, etc.) of the grid.
   - For each such column `i`:
     - It checks if the arrow in the first row at position `i` is `<` and the arrow in the second row at position `i+1` is also `<`.
     - Alternatively, it checks if the arrow in the first row at position `i` is `<` and the arrow in the second row at position `i-1` is also `<`.

3. **Output:**
   - If any of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If none of the conditions are met for any column, the program prints 'YES'.

### Reasoning

The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks certain conditions for the odd-indexed columns and does not account for the movement of the robot in the even-indexed columns. Specifically, the robot can move to both even and odd columns, and the program should check the conditions for all columns to ensure the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

### Example Analysis

Consider the example with `n = 4` and the grid:
```
>>><
><>>
```

- The program checks the odd-indexed columns (1, 3):
  - At column 1: `a[0] = '>'` and `b[1] = '<'`. The condition is not met.
  - At column 3: `a[2] = '>'` and `b[3] = '>'`. The condition is not met.

Since none of the conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', which is incorrect. The robot can actually reach (2, 4) by moving as follows:
- From (1, 1) to (1, 2) to (2, 2) to (2, 3) to (2, 4).

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the robot's movement in all columns and only checks specific conditions for odd-indexed columns.

### Correctness

Correctness: **False**
