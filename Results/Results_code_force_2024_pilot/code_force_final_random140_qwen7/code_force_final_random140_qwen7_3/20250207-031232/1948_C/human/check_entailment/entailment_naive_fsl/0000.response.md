Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program checks only certain conditions and prints 'NO' if those conditions are met, but it fails to consider other valid paths the robot might take to reach the cell (2, n).

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
6
><<<>>
>>><><
```

In this case, the robot can still reach the cell (2, 6) by following the path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (1, 5) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6). However, the program incorrectly prints 'NO' because it only checks specific conditions without considering all possible valid paths.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
