### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program is flawed. The program only checks the conditions for odd-indexed columns, which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n). The robot can move to both even and odd columns, and the conditions need to be checked for all columns.

To properly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the robot can move from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n) by following the arrows. This requires checking the path for every column, not just the odd-indexed ones.

### Correct Solution

A correct solution would involve simulating the robot's movement for each test case and checking if it can reach the target cell (2, n). Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        x, y = 1, 1  # Starting position
        
        while True:
            # Move to the next column
            if y % 2 == 1:  # Odd column
                if y + 1 < n and a[y] == '<' and b[y + 1] == '<':
                    print('NO')
                    break
                elif y - 1 >= 0 and a[y] == '<' and b[y - 1] == '<':
                    print('NO')
                    break
                y += 1
            else:  # Even column
                if y + 1 < n and a[y] == '>' and b[y + 1] == '>':
                    print('NO')
                    break
                elif y - 1 >= 0 and a[y] == '>' and b[y - 1] == '>':
                    print('NO')
                    break
                y += 1
            
            # Check if the robot has reached the target cell
            if y == n and x == 2:
                print('YES')
                break
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, the length of the grid.
   - It then reads two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid.

2. **Simulating Robot Movement:**
   - Initialize the starting position `(x, y) = (1, 1)`.
   - Use a while loop to simulate the robot's movement until it either reaches the target cell (2, n) or gets stuck.
   - For each column:
     - If the column is odd (`y % 2 == 1`), check if the robot can move down and left or down and right.
     - If the column is even, check if the robot can move down and right or down and left.
   - If the robot reaches the target cell (2, n), print 'YES'.
   - If the robot gets stuck (either by hitting a boundary or getting blocked by arrows), print 'NO'.

### Final Evaluation

The original program is incorrect because it only checks specific conditions for odd-indexed columns, which is insufficient. The correct solution involves simulating the robot's movement for each column and checking if it can reach the target cell.

Final: **False**
