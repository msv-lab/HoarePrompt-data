Output State: The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to the last odd number checked in the loop (which is 5 based on the given information), `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, and `i` will be equal to `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking. If during any iteration of the loop, the condition `i + 1 < n` and (`a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'`) is met, the loop breaks and 'NO' is printed. If the loop completes without breaking, 'YES' is printed.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `n` must be at least 5, `a` and `b` are still the strings provided by the user, and `i` will be `n-1`. If the loop finds a pair of '<' characters in the correct positions in `a` and `b`, it will stop early and print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES' after checking all possible pairs.
