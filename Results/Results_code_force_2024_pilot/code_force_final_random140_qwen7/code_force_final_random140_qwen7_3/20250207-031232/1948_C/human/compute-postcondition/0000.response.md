Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the value of `input()`.

3. **Initial state of the variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `n` is even.
   - Each test case consists of two strings of length `n`, where each character is either '<' or '>'.

4. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 0` (as per Python's `range` function), we need to ensure that `input()` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The values of `t` and `n` do not directly affect the loop execution, but they provide context about the input data.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `input()`. Specifically, `input()` must be at least 1.

**State:**
**`input()` must be at least 1**
