Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
