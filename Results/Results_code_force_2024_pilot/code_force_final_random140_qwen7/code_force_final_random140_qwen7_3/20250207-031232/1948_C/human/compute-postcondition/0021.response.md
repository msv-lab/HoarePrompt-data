Let's analyze the given task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `n` must be less than or equal to the last odd number less than the initial value of `n`.
   - `a` and `b` are strings input by the user.
   - `i` is the last odd number processed in the loop.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j` in `range(int(input()))`.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know it processes the strings `a` and `b` based on the condition:
   - If for any `i` in the range (1, n, 2), the condition `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'` is met, then the loop will break and print 'NO'.
   - If none of these conditions are met for all iterations, the loop will print 'YES'.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be the current value of `j` plus 1.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `n`: Remains unchanged because the loop condition does not directly affect `n`.
   - `a` and `b`: Remain unchanged because the loop body does not modify these strings.
   - `i`: Remains unchanged because the loop body does not modify this variable.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `j` for the next iteration.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `n` must be less than or equal to the last odd number less than the initial value of `n`.
- `a` and `b` are strings input by the user.
- `i` is the last odd number processed in the loop.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be less than or equal to the last odd number less than the initial value of `n`, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, `i` is the last odd number processed in the loop, `j` is incremented by 1**.
