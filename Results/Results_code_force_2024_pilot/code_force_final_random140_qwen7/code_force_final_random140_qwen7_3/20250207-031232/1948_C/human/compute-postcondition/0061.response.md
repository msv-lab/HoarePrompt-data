Output State: `j` remains 0, `i` reaches the last odd number less than `n`, and `n` remains greater than or equal to 1. If the condition in the if statement is true at any point during the loop's execution, the loop breaks and prints 'NO'. If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'YES'.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, if the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` was never met for any `i` within the specified range, the final output will be 'YES'. Otherwise, if the condition was met at any point, the output will be 'NO'.
