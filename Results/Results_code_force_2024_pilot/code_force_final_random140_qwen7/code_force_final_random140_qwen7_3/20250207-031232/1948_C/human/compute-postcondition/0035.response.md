Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n-1` with a step of 2 (i.e., `i` takes odd values).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.
   - Given `i` is currently 3, the next value of `i` would be `3 + 2 = 5`.

5. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given `i` is now 5, `n` must be greater than 5 to allow the loop to execute again.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be set to 5.
   - `n` must still be greater than 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5**.
