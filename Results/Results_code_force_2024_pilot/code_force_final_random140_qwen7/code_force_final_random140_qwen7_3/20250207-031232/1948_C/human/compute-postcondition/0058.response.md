Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is the next odd number after the previous value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block defined in the provided code snippet, the only effect is that the execution will exit the context where this `break` statement is placed. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
