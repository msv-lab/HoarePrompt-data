Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user**.

The code assigns the value of the input provided by the user to the variable `b`. Since the initial state of `n` and `a` was given, they remain unchanged. The new variable `b` is assigned the value of the string input by the user.
