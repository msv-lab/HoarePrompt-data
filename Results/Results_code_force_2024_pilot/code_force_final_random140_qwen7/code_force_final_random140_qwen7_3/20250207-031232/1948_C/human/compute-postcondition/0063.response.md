Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of the arrow in each cell of the respective row of the grid. The function checks the direction of arrows in both strings and returns a value based on the relationship between the two strings.**

Given the constraints, the function likely evaluates some condition related to the directions of arrows in the two strings and returns a result based on that evaluation. However, without the specific logic described in the problem statement, we can only infer that the function takes two string inputs of equal length (n), each containing only '<' or '>' characters, and returns a value based on comparing these strings.
