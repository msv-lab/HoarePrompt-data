Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `i` is 3. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is less than a character, or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is less than a character, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
