Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved, which are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, n, 2)`. This means `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2 until it is no longer less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of characters.
   - `b` is a list of characters.
   - The condition to break out of the loop is if `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 3 (since `i` will now be 3 and `i + 1` will be 4).

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**.
