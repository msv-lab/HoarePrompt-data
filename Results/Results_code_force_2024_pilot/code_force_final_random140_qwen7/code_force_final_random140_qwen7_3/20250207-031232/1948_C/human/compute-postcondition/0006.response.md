Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are strings input by the user.
- The condition is met where either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == '<' and b[i + 1] == '<')` or `(a[i] == '<' and b[i - 1] == '<')`.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

The output does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, or `n`, but rather on the fixed string `'NO'` that is being printed.

Output: **NO**
