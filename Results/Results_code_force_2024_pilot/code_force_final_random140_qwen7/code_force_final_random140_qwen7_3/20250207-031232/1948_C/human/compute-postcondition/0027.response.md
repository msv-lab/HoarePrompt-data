Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of characters, and `b` is a list of characters.
- It also specifies that the current value of `a[i]` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is 1) is '<'.
- Additionally, it states that either `b[i+1]` (which is `b[2]` since `i` is 1) is '<' or `b[i-1]` (which is `b[0]` if it exists, but since no such condition is given, we consider only `b[2]`) is '<'.
- Lastly, it mentions that `i + 1` is less than `n` (which means `2 < n`).

Given this information, the print statement `print('NO')` simply outputs the string 'NO'. There are no variables or objects from the initial state that need to be substituted into the print statement because the statement itself does not reference any of the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, or `n`.
