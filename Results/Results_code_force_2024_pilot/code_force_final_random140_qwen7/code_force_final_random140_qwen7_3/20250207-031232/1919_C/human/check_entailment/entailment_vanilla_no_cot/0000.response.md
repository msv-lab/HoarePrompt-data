Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to achieve the minimum possible penalty. The logic in the code tries to split the array into two subsequences `a` and `b` such that `a` contains elements less than or equal to the previous element in `a`, and `b` contains the rest. This approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to sort the array and then split it into two parts such that the penalty is minimized. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        a = [lit[0]]
        b = []
        for i in range(1, n):
            if lit[i] > a[-1]:
                a.append(lit[i])
            else:
                b.append(lit[i])
        s = 0
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
                s += 1
        for i in range(1, len(b)):
            if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
                s += 1
        print(s)

func()
```

This solution sorts the array first and then splits it into two subsequences `a` and `b` such that `a` contains elements in increasing order and `b` contains the remaining elements. This ensures that the penalty is minimized because both `a` and `b` will have no decreasing pairs, resulting in a penalty of 0 for both.
