Reasoning:
- The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it initializes two lists `a` and `b` and populates them based on the comparison of consecutive elements in the input list `lit`.
- The logic for counting the penalty is implemented correctly:
  - For list `a`, it counts the number of times an element is greater than its predecessor.
  - For list `b`, it counts the number of times an element is greater than its predecessor.
  - The total penalty is the sum of these counts.
- The final output for each test case is printed correctly, which matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
