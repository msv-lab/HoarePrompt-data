Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `lit` itself.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` with the first element of `lit` and an empty list, respectively.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the remaining elements of `lit` starting from the second element.
   - If the last element of `a` is less than the current element of `lit`, it appends the current element to `b`.
   - Otherwise, it appends the current element to `a`.

3. **Calculating Penalties:**
   - The program calculates the penalty for both `a` and `b` separately.
   - For each list, it counts the number of indices `i` where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i-1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total penalty which is the sum of penalties of `a` and `b`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The logic for splitting the array seems to be based on the relative order of elements. However, this approach might not always yield the optimal split. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty, but the given logic does not guarantee this.

2. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The penalty calculation logic is correct. It correctly counts the number of increasing pairs in each subsequence.

3. **Optimality:**
   - The given logic does not ensure that the split is done optimally. For example, consider the input `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. The program would split it into `[5, 4, 3]` and `[2, 1]`, resulting in a penalty of 2 (since there are no increasing pairs in `[2, 1]` and one increasing pair in `[5, 4, 3]`). However, the optimal split would be `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` and `[]`, resulting in a penalty of 0.

### Conclusion

The given program does not guarantee the minimum possible penalty because it does not explore all possible splits optimally. Therefore, the program is not correct for the given problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
