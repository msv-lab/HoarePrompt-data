#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a, b = [lit[0]], []
        
        cp = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[-1] < lit[i]:
                b.append(lit[i])
            else:
                a.append(lit[i])
        
        s = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
                s += 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(b)):
            if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
                s += 1
        
        print(s)
        
    #State: s is equal to the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than its preceding element, plus the total number of iterations the loop has run, which is `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it creates two lists, a and b, from the input list. It then counts the number of times an element in list a is greater than its predecessor and the same for list b. Finally, it prints the total count of such instances for each test case.
