Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`; `a` now has an additional element which is `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 1, `a` gains an additional element which is the value of `lit[1]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
