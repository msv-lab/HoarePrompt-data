Output State: **`total` is 0, `s` is `n + 6`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) + n + 1`**

Explanation: The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Initially, `s` was defined as `n + 5`. After adding 1 to `s`, the new value of `s` becomes `n + 6`. The values of `total`, `cp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
