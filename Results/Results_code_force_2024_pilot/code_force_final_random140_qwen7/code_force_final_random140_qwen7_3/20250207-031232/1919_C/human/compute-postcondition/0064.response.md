Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If the last element of list `a` is less than the element at index `i` in list `lit`, then list `b` has appended the element at index `i` from list `lit`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `a` now has an additional element which is `lit[i]`.
