Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 3; `b` contains the element `lit[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) from the list `lit` to the list `b`. Since `i` is 3, `b` now includes the element at index 3 of `lit`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, but `b` has been updated with the new element.
