Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(b)`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `len(b) - 1`.
3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `s` is `n + 10`
   - `cp` is 0
   - `i` is 4
   - `len(b)` must be at least 5
   - The condition `b[i] > b[i - 1]` holds true.

4. **Adjust the State for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`, which means `i` will become 5.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be 5) must still be within the range `1` to `len(b) - 1`. This means `len(b)` must be at least 6.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(b)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `s` is `n + 10`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `len(b)` must be at least 6**
