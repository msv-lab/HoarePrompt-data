Output State: **`s` is equal to `n + 4`, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` is a list that has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, and the loop has executed until `i` is equal to the length of `b` + 1; `lit` is updated to a list of integers based on user input.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the resulting list in `lit`. This operation changes the value of `lit`, but does not affect the values of `s`, `i`, `a`, or `b`. The precondition that `i` is `len(b) + 1` and that `b` has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop remains unchanged.
