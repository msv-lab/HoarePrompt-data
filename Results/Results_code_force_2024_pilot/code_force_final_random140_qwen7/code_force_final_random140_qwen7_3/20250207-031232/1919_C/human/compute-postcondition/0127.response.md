Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is either `len(b) + 2` or `len(b) + 3`, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is equal to `n + 4`, `cp` is 0, `a` is one of the following: `[lit[0]]`, `[lit[0], lit[i-1]]`, or `[lit[0], lit[i-1], lit[i]]`, `b` has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, `lit` is updated to a list of integers based on user input, and `a[-1]` is less than `b[-1]` if the if part is executed, otherwise `a[-1]` is greater than or equal to `b[-1]`.
