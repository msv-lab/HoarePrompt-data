Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, the last element of list `a` is less than the element at index `i` in list `lit`, and list `b` has appended the element at index `i` from list `lit`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` from list `lit` to list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `b` now contains the element at index 1 from `lit`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
