Postcondition: `total` is 0, `s` is `n + 6`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) + n + 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then the values remain as specified in the if part. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[i - 1]`, the values also remain as specified in the else part (which is not provided but implied to keep the values unchanged).
