Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `a` is a list of integers.
- The last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`.
- `b` includes the element `lit[i]`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `i`.

### Current State
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`.
- Therefore, the last element of `a` is less than `lit[k]`.
- `b` includes `lit[k]`.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Hence, `i` will be `k + 1` in the next iteration.

### Adjusted State
- Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
- We need to check if the condition `a[-1] < lit[i]` holds true for the new value of `i`.

### Updated State
- The last element of `a` remains the same (since it hasn't changed yet).
- The new value of `i` is `k + 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`a` is a list of integers, the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `k + 1` in `lit`, `b` includes the element `lit[k]`**.

To be more precise:
State: **`a` is a list of integers, the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i + 1` in `lit`, `b` includes the element `lit[i]`**.

So, the final state is:
State: **`a` is a list of integers, the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i + 1` in `lit`, `b` includes the element `lit[i]`**.
