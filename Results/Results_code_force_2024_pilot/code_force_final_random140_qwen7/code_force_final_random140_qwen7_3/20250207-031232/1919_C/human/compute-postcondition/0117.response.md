Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is `len(b) + 1` (which must be at least 1), `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is equal to `n + 4`, `cp` is 0, `a` is `[lit[0]]`, `b` is a list that has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, `lit` is updated to a list of integers based on user input, and the last element of `a` is less than the element `lit[i]`.
