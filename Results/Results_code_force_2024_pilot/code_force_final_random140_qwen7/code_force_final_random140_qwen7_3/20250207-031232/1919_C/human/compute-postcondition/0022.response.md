Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `a` will be a list of integers where the elements are either the smallest elements from `lit` or elements that were greater than the previous element in `a`. The list `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that were not appended to `a` during the loop's execution, following the conditions specified in the loop body.**

In more detail, `a` will retain its final state as built up through the loop, capturing the sequence of elements from `lit` where each element is either the smallest encountered so far or greater than the last element added to `a`. On the other hand, `b` will collect all elements from `lit` that did not meet the condition to be added to `a`, thus providing a complementary set of elements from `lit` that were skipped based on the comparison logic inside the loop.
