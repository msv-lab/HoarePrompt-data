Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is equal to `n + 3`, where `n` is the number of iterations the loop ran.
- `i` is `len(b)`, meaning it equals the length of the list `b` after the loop has completed.
- `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`.
- `b` is a list that has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop and has reached its final state after `n` iterations.

The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is `n + 3`.

Output: **n + 3**
