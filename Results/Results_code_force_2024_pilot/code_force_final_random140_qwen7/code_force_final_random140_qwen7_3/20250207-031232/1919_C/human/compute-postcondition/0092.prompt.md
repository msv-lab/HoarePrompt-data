Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is 0, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, and `b` will be an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is 1, `i` is 2, `a` must have at least one element, `b` is an empty list, and if the current value of `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is greater than the previous value of `a[i-1]` (which is `a[0]`), then the condition holds as specified. If the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` does not hold, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is 1, `i` is 3, `a` must have at least one element, `b` is an empty list, and either `a[3] > a[2]` holds or the condition does not trigger (meaning `a[3] <= a[2]`).

Explanation: The if statement checks if `a[i] > a[i - 1]` where `i` is 3. If the condition is true, then `s` becomes 2, indicating that the element at index 3 is greater than the element at index 2. If the condition is false, then `s` remains 1, and the condition `a[3] > a[2]` does not hold. The value of `i` is set to 3 in both cases, and `b` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is 2, `i` is 4, `a` must have at least one element, `b` is an empty list. If the element at index `i` in array `a` is greater than the element at index `i-1`, then `s` is set to 2. Otherwise, the values of `s`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
