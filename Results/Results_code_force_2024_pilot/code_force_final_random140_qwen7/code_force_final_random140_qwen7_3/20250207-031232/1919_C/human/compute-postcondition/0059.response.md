Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `len(b) + 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is initially `len(b) + 1`, and `len(b)` is currently 0 (since `b` is an empty list), `i` is initially `1` (because `len(b) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`).
   - Since `n` is an input integer greater than 0, the loop will execute as long as `1 < n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
