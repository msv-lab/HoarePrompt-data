Output State: **`lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `s` is equal to the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than its preceding element, `i` is equal to `len(b) + 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `cp = 0` initializes the variable `cp` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions with `cp` being added as a new initialized variable.
