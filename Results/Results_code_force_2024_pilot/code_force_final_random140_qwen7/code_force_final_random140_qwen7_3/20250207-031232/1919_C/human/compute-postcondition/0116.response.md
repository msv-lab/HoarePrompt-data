Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop condition is `range(1, n)`, which means `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be at least 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 (since `range(1, n)` requires `n > 1`).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` is given as `i` is `len(b) + 1`.
   - The initial value of `s` is given as `s` is equal to `n + 4`.
   - The initial value of `cp` is given as `cp` is 0.
   - The initial value of `a` is given as `a` is `[lit[0]]`.
   - The initial value of `b` is a list that has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop.
   - The initial value of `lit` is a list of integers based on user input.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing by adjusting the values of `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- Since `i` is initially `len(b) + 1`, we need to ensure that `len(b) + 1` is at least 1. This means `len(b)` must be 0 or more.
- For the loop to start, `n` must be greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` requires `n > 1`.

### Final State:
- We need to ensure that `len(b) + 1` is at least 1, which implies `len(b)` must be 0 or more.
- We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `len(b) + 1` (which must be at least 1), `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is equal to `n + 4`, `cp` is 0, `a` is `[lit[0]]`, `b` is a list that has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, and `lit` is updated to a list of integers based on user input.**
