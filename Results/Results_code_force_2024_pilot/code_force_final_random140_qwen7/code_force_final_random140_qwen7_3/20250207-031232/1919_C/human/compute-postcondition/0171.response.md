Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it creates two lists, a and b, from the input list. It then counts the number of times an element in list a is greater than its predecessor and the same for list b. Finally, it prints the total count of such instances for each test case.**
