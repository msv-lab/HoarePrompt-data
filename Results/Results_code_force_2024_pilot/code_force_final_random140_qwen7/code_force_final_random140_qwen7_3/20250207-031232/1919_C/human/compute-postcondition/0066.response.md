Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - If the last element of list `a` is less than the element at index `i` in list `lit`, then list `b` has appended the element at index `i` from list `lit`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `a` now has an additional element which is `lit[i]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - The variable `n` remains constant within the loop.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to continue but does not change within the loop itself.

5. **Post-Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - After the first iteration (where `i` was 1), the last element of list `a` is compared with `lit[1]`.
   - Depending on the result, either `b` appends `lit[1]` or `a` gets an additional element `lit[1]`.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
