Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, the last element of `a` is either less than the element at index `i + 2` in `lit` or equal to `lit[i + 1]`; `b` includes the element `lit[i + 1]` and has appended the element `lit[i]`**.

This means that the list `b` has appended the element `lit[i]` to itself, and the conditions regarding `a` and `b` remain unchanged from the initial state except for the new element added to `b`.
