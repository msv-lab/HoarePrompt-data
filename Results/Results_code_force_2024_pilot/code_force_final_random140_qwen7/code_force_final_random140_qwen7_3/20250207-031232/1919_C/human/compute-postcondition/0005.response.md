Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, n)`.
2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will start with `i = 1` and increment `i` until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be at least 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`).

Given the initial states:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`.
- `cp` is 0.
- `b` is an empty list.

We need to ensure that the loop can start by setting `i` to 1 and ensuring `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` should be greater than 1.

The other variables (`t`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `b`) do not affect the loop's ability to start and can remain as they are.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
