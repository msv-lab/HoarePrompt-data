Output State: **`cp` is 0, `s` is equal to `n + 4`, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `a` is `[lit[0]]`, `b` is a list that has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, and the loop has executed until `i` is equal to the length of `b` + 1; `lit` is updated to a list of integers based on user input.**

The code initializes `cp` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `lit`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
