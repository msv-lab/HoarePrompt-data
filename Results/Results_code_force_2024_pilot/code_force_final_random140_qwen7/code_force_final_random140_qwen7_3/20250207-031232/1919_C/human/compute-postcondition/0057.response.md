Output State: **`lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `s` is equal to the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than its preceding element, `i` is equal to `len(b) + 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `a` as a list containing the first element of `lit` and sets `b` as an empty list. The values of `lit`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
