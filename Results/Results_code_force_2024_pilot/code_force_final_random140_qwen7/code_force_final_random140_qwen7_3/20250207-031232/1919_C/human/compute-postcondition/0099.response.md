Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b) - 1`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(b) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is 3
   - `i` is `n` (where `n` is the length of `b` minus 1, since the loop runs from 1 to `len(b) - 1`)
   - `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`
   - `b` must have at least 1 element
   - If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, no change is needed. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, the condition remains as is.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop runs from 1 to `len(b) - 1`, the next value of `i` should be `n + 1` if `n < len(b) - 1`.
   - The value of `b` does not change within the loop body based on the given conditions, so it remains the same.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `s` remains 3.
   - `i` changes from `n` to `n + 1`.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `s` is 3, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` must have at least 1 element.**
