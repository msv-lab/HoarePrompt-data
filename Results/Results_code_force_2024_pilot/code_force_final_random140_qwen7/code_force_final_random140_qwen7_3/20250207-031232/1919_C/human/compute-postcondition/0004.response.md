Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `cp` is 0, and `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `cp = 0` initializes the variable `cp` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
