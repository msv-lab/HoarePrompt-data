Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `len(b) - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is 4.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`.
   - `b` must have at least 1 element.
   - If the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`, then no change is needed. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, then the condition remains as is.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments by `1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `n + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 2`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - Therefore, `n + 2` must be less than `len(b)`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `s` remains unchanged at `4`.
   - `i` changes from `n + 1` to `n + 2`.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` must still have at least 1 element.
   - The condition for `b[i]` being greater than `b[i - 1]` remains the same, but since `i` is now `n + 2`, the condition will be checked for `b[n + 2]` compared to `b[n + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`s` is 4, `i` is `n + 2`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` must have at least 1 element, and if the current value of `b[i]` (which is `b[n + 2]`) is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]` (which is `b[n + 1]`), then no change is needed. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, then the condition remains as is.**
