Output State: **`s` is equal to `n + 4`, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` is a list that has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, and the loop has executed until `i` is equal to the length of `b` + 1; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`s`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
