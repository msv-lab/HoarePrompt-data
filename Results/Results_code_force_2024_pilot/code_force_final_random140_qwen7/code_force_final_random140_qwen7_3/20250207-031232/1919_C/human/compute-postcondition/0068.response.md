Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than 1; `a` contains the element `lit[2]`**

The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` from the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 2, `a` will now contain the element `lit[2]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` is greater than 1 is still valid.
