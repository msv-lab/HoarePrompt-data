Postcondition: `s` is 1, `i` is 2, `a` must have at least one element, `b` is an empty list, and if the current value of `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is greater than the previous value of `a[i-1]` (which is `a[0]`), then the condition holds as specified. If the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` does not hold, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
