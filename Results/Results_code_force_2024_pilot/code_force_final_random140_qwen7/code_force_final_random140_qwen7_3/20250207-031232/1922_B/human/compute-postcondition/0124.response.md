Output State: **`current_index` is 41, `results` is `[ans]`, `hashing` is `{a[0]: 0}`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and the current value of `a[i]` is not in the `hashing` dictionary.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] = 0` assigns the key `a[i]` (which is `a[0]` given the initial state) to the value `0` in the `hashing` dictionary. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
