Output State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 5**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to `0`. Given that `i` was initially `4`, after executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes `5`. The value of `a[5]` is set to `0` in the `hashing` dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged.
