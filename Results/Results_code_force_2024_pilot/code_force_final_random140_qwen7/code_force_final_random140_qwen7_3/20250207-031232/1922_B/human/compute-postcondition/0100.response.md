Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, where `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`. The variable `hashing` will be a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` (specifically, elements from `data[15]` to `data[29]`), and the corresponding value is the sum of all indices `i` for which the key appears consecutively in the list `a`. The variable `ans` will be the sum of all values in `hashing` for keys that appear consecutively in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `i` will be one less than `n`, `hashing` will map each unique consecutive element in `a` to the total of its indices, and `ans` will be the sum of these mapped values.
