Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `current_index` is 16
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\)
   - `results` is [ans]
   - `hashing` is an empty dictionary
   - `a` is [int(data[15])]
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`
   - `i` is `n - 1`

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n - 1 + 1 = n`.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes `n`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `current_index` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `results` remains unchanged.
   - `hashing` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

So, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`current_index` is 16, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[15])], `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is `n`**
