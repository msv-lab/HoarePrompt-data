Output State: **`current_index` is 10, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is `[int(data[4]), int(data[7]), int(data[9])]`, `n` is an integer from `data[5]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**.

The value of `current_index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 9 to 10. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
