Output State: **`results` is `[ans]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is the cumulative sum of values in `hashing` for each key that has consecutive occurrences in `a`, `current_index` is 30, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is `n + 2` initially but changes during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `hashing`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables from the initial state, with `hashing` now being an empty dictionary.
