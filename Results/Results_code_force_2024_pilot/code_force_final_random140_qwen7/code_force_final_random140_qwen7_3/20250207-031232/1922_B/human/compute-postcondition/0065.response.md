Output State: **`current_index` is 17, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[15]), int(data[16])], `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is `n`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(int(data[current_index]))` appends the integer value of `data[current_index]` to the list `a`. Given that `current_index` is initially 16, `a` is initially `[int(data[15])]`, and `current_index` is incremented by 1 after the append operation, `a` becomes `[int(data[15]), int(data[16])]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
