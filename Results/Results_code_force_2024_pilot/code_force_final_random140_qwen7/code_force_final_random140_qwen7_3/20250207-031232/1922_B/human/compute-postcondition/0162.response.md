Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns nothing explicitly but processes the data according to the given constraints and relationships.**

This means the function `func_1` handles multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers. It processes these inputs without any direct parameter in the function signature, adhering to the specified constraints.
