Output State: **`i` is less than `n - 1`; `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`; `hashing[a[i]]` is the original value plus `i`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by `i`. Since `i` is less than `n - 1`, the condition for the initial state remains true. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is derived from `data[15]`. The value of `hashing[a[i]]` is updated to its original value plus `i`.
