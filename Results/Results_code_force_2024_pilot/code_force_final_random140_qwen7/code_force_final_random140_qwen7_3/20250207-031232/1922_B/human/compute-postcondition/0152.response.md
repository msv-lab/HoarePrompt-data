Output State: `current_index` is 68, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is a list containing the final answer and the answers from the previous iterations, i.e., `[final_ans, ans_2, ans_1]`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key-value pair is of the form `a[i]: i` for every consecutive pair of elements `a[i]` and `a[i+1]` that are equal across all iterations, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[45]` to `data[67]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[45]`, `i` is `n + 2` initially but changes during the loop iterations.

This state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations, with `current_index` pointing to the next element after the last processed data. The `results` list contains the cumulative answers from all iterations, with each iteration's answer stored sequentially. The `hashing` dictionary captures the sum of indices for consecutive identical elements across all lists processed in the loop, and `a` and `n` reflect the state of the last processed list.
