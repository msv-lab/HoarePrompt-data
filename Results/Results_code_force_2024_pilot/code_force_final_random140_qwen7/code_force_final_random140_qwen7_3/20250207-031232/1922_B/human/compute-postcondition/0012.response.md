Output State: **`current_index` is 5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[4])], `n` is an integer from `data[5]`, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `data[current_index]` (which is `data[4]`) to the list `a`. Since `current_index` was 4, after appending, `current_index` is incremented to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
