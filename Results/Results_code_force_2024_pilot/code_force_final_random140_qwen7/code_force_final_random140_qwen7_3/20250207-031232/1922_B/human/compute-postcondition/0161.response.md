Output State: **The `results` list contains the final answer calculated by the loop, repeated `t` times, and the loop has completed all its iterations.**

Natural Language Description: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the `results` list will contain the final answer calculated by the loop, repeated exactly `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000. The `current_index` is 68, indicating that the loop has processed all the data up to the last element. The `hashing` dictionary remains empty as no more pairs of consecutive equal elements were found in the remaining data. The list `a` contains the last set of integers processed, sorted, and `n` is the count of these integers. The variable `i` starts at `n + 2` for the first iteration of the inner loop but increments with each pass through the loop, and by the end of all iterations, it would have reached a value that reflects the total number of iterations completed.
