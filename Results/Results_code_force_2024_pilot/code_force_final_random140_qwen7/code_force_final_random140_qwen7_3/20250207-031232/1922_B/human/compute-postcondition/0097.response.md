Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is incremented by `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += hashing[a[i]]` increments `ans` by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. Since `a[i]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `hashing[a[i]]`, but we know it will be incremented by `i` after this line of code. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
