Output State: **`current_index` is 18, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[15]), int(data[16])], `n` is the integer value of `data[15], `i` is `n`.**

The value of `current_index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 17 to 18. The other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
