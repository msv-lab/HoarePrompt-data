Output State: `current_index` is 30, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is a list containing integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is 0.

Explanation: The loop runs until `current_index` reaches the length of the data array starting from index 15. Given that the loop increments `current_index` by 1 each iteration and we know the state after 3 iterations (`current_index` is 20), we can deduce that the total length of the data array from index 15 onwards is 15 (since 20 - 15 = 5, but the loop has run 3 times already, so 20 - 15 + 3 = 8 more iterations needed, making it 15 in total). Therefore, the loop will execute 15 times in total, setting `current_index` to 30. During these iterations, `a` will contain integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]`. Since `i` starts at `n - 1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration of the loop, after 15 iterations, `i` will be 0.
