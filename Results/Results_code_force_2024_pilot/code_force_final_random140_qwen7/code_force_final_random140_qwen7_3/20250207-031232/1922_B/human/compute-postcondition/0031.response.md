Output State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `1`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `hashing` by incrementing the value associated with the key `a[i]` by `i`. Given that `i` was initially 1 and now is incremented to 2, the key `a[1]` (which was already present in the dictionary) is updated with its value incremented by 2. Therefore, the value of `hashing[a[1]]` becomes 1 (initial value) + 2 = 3. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
