Output State: `current_index` is 12, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is `[int(data[4]), int(data[7]), int(data[9]), int(data[10])]`, `n` is an integer from `data[5]`, `i` is 3.

Explanation: The loop continues to append elements to the list `a` and increment `current_index` until it has iterated `n` times. Given that the loop executed 3 times up to the last provided state, and `n` must be greater than 2, the loop will execute one more time (making it 4 iterations in total). This means `a` will have 4 elements, `current_index` will be incremented to 12 (since each iteration increments `current_index` by 1), and `i` will be set to 3.
