Output State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is sorted, `n` is exactly the length of `a`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The line `hashing = {}` initializes the `hashing` dictionary to an empty dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
