State: **`current_index` is 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from `data[current_index]`, `i` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
- The loop condition `range(n)` means that the loop will run `n` times, where `n` is determined by the value of `data[current_index]`.
- The other variables (`current_index`, `t`, `results`, `hashing`, `a`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` (which should be set to 0) and `n` (which should be set to the value of `data[current_index]`).
