Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `current_index` is 13
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `results` is [ans]
   - `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is `a[1]` and the value is `0`
   - `a` is sorted
   - `n` is exactly the length of `a`
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`current_index`, `results`, `hashing`, `a`, `n`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is `a[1]` and the value is `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` is exactly the length of `a`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`**.
