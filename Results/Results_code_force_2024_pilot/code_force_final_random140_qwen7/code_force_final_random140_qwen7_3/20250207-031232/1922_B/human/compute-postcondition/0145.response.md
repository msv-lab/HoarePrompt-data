Output State: **`current_index` is 42, `results` is `[new_ans]`, `new_ans` is 0, and `hashing[a[44]]` is 44.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` increments the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by `i`. Given that `i` is `42` (since `a[i]` refers to `a[42]`), `hashing[a[42]]` would be incremented by `42`. However, since `a[42]` is not specified, we consider the general case where `hashing[a[42]]` was previously `0` (as per the initial state). After the increment, `hashing[a[42]]` becomes `0 + 42 = 42`. The other variables remain unchanged.
