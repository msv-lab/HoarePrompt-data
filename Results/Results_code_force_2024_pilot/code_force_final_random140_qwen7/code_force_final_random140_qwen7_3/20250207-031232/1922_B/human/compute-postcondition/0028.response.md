Output State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[0]` and value `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `hashing`. Since `i` was initially `0`, after executing this line, `hashing` contains the key `a[0]` with the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
