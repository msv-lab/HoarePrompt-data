Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - We know that `current_index` is 41.
   - We know that `results` is `[ans]`.
   - We know that `hashing` is an empty dictionary.
   - We know that `ans` is 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive).
   - For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2.
   - The initial value of `i` will be 0 when the loop starts.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` must be 0.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`current_index` is 41, `results` is `[ans]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**.
