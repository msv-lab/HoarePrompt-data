Output State: **`current_index` is 41, `results` is `[ans]`, `hashing` is updated such that if `a[i]` is not in the `hashing` dictionary, then `hashing[a[i]]` is set to `i + 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 to 42, and `n` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by adding `i` to the existing value in the dictionary. Given the initial conditions, `i` was 41, so now `i` is incremented by 1 to become 42. The value of `current_index`, `results`, `ans`, and `n` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on them directly. The `hashing` dictionary updates according to the condition specified, setting `hashing[a[i]]` to `i + 1` if `a[i]` is not already present in the dictionary.
