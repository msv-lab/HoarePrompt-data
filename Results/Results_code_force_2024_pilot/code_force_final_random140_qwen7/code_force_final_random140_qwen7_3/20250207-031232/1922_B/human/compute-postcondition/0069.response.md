`current_index` is incremented by 1. The original value of `current_index` was 19, so the new value is 20. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_index` is 20, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[15]), int(data[16]), int(data[18])], `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is `n + 1`.**
