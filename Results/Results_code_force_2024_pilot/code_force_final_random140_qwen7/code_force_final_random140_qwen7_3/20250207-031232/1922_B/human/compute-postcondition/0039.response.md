Postcondition: `current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 5. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing` is updated with the key `a[i]` and value `0`.
