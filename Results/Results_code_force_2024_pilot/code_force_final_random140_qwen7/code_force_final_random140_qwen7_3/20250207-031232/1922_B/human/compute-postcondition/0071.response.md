Output State: `current_index` is 30, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is a list containing integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is `n + 2`.

Explanation: The loop runs until `current_index` reaches the length of the data starting from index 15. Since the loop increments `current_index` by 1 each iteration and we know it executes 3 times up to `current_index` being 20, it will continue to run until `current_index` is 30 (15 + 15 = 30). During each iteration, the value at `data[current_index]` is appended to the list `a`. Therefore, `a` will contain 15 elements starting from `data[15]` to `data[29]`. The variable `n` remains as the integer value of `data[15]`, and `i` is updated to `n + 2` after the loop completes.
