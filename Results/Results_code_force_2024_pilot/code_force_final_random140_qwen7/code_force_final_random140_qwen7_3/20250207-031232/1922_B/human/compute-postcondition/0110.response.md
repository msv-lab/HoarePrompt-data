Output State: **`current_index` is 33; `results` is `[ans]`; `hashing` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is the cumulative sum of values in `hashing` for each key that has consecutive occurrences in `a`; `n` is the integer value of `data[31]` and must be at least 1; `i` is less than `n`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\); `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]` with the additional element `int(data[32])` appended to it.**

Explanation: The line `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Initially, `current_index` was 32, so now it is 33. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
