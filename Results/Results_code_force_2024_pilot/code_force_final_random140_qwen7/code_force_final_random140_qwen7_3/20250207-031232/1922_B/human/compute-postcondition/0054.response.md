Output State: `current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is `a[1]` and the value is `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` is exactly the length of `a`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The `current_index` remains unchanged at 13. The `t` variable, which was initially within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), also remains unchanged. The `results` list stays empty as no additions or modifications were mentioned for it in the loop. The `hashing` dictionary starts with the key `a[1]` having a value of `0`. For each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal, the corresponding value in `hashing` (for the first element of the pair) is added to `ans`. The variable `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `i` is set to `n - 1` after the last iteration.
