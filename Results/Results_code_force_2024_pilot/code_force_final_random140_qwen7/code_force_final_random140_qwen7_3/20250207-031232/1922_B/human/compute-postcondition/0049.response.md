Output State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 8, `ans` is `hashing[a[6]]`, `hashing[a[8]]` is `8`**.

Explanation: The line `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the dictionary `hashing` by adding the value of `i` (which is 8) to the existing value of `hashing[a[8]]`. Since `a[8]` was not previously in `hashing`, it is added with the value 8. All other variables remain unchanged.
