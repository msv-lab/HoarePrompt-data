Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n - 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`.
   - `hashing[a[i]]` is the original value plus `i` if the condition `a[i] == a[i + 1]` is true.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it is derived from `data[15]` and does not change within the loop.
   - `ans` will be adjusted based on the new value of `a[i]` during the next iteration, but its current value is not directly modified by the loop itself.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ans` will be adjusted based on the new value of `a[i]` during the next iteration, but its current value is not directly modified by the loop itself.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is the original value plus `i` if the condition `a[i] == a[i + 1]` is true.**
