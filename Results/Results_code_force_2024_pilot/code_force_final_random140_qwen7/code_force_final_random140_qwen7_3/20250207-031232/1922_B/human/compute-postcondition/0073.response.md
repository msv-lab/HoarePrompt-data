Output State: **`current_index` is 30, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [0], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is `n + 2**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. Since `ans` was previously part of the `results` list, it is updated to `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
