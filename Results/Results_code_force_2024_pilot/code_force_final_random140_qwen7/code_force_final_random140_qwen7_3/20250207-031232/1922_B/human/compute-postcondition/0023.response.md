Output State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is sorted, `n` is an integer from `data[5]`, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a`. Since the loop had already appended elements to `a` and incremented `current_index` to 12, and the loop condition was met for 3 iterations, the loop will run one more time, making `current_index` 13. The list `a` is sorted, but the exact values of its elements are not specified in the initial state and are not needed to describe the output state. The other variables remain unchanged.
