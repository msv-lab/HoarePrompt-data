Output State: **`i` is less than `n - 1`; `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`; `hashing[a[i]]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `0` to `hashing[a[i]]`. Since `i` must be less than `n - 1` and `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `hashing[a[i]]` is now `0`.
