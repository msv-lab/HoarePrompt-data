Output State: **`current_index` is 44, `results` is `[final_ans, ans]`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key-value pair is of the form `a[i]: i` for every consecutive pair of elements `a[i]` and `a[i+1]` that are equal, and `final_ans` is the sum of all values in the `hashing` dictionary.**

Explanation:
- The line `results.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially `[final_ans]`, after appending `ans`, `results` becomes `[final_ans, ans]`.
- The other variables (`current_index`, `hashing`, and `final_ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states. `current_index` is updated to be one more than the last index processed, which is 43, making it 44.
