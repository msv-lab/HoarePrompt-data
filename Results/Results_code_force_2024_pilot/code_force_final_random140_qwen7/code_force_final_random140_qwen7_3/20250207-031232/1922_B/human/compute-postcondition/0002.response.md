Output State: **`current_index` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using `split()` method.**

The code initializes `current_index` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `data`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
