Output State: **`current_index` is 9, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is `[int(data[4]), int(data[7]), int(data[9])]`, `n` is an integer from `data[5]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**.

Explanation: The code appends `int(data[current_index])` to the list `a`. Since `current_index` is initially 8, after executing the code, `current_index` is incremented by 1, making it 9. The value at `data[9]` is appended to `a`, resulting in `a` being updated to `[int(data[4]), int(data[7]), int(data[9])]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
