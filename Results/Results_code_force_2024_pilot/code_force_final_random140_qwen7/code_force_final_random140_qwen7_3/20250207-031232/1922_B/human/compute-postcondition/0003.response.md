Output State: **`current_index` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[current_index])` takes the value at the current index (which is 0) from the list `data` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `t`. After this assignment, `current_index` is incremented by 1 to move to the next element in the list. The initial value range for `t` is maintained as 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The other variables (`n` and `data`) remain unchanged.
