Output State: **`i` is less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is the original value plus `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += hashing[a[i]]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. The condition `i < n - 1` and the definition of `n` and `hashing[a[i]]` remain the same as the initial state.
