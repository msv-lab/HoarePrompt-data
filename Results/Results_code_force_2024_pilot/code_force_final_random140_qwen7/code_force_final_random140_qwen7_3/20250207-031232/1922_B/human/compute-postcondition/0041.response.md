Output State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `1`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 6.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by adding `i` to the existing value. Initially, `hashing` had the key `a[1]` with value `0`. Since `i` was initially `5`, the condition `if a[i] not in hashing` would be true (assuming `a[5]` is not already a key in `hashing`). Thus, `hashing` is updated to have the key `a[5]` with value `1`. Now, `i` is incremented by 1, making it `6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
