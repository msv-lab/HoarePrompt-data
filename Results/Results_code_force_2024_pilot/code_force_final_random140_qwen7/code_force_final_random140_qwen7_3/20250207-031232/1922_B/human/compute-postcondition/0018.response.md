Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `current_index` is 8
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `results` is an empty list
   - `hashing` is an empty dictionary
   - `a` is `[int(data[4]), int(data[7])]`
   - `n` is an integer from `data[5]`
   - `i` is 1

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

State: **`current_index` is 8, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is `[int(data[4]), int(data[7])]`, `n` is an integer from `data[5]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
