Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `hashing[a[i]]` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `hashing[a[i]] = 0` sets the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `ans`, `n`, or the condition `a[i] == a[i + 1]`. Therefore, the value of `i` remains as `i + 1`, `ans` is updated based on whether `a[i]` was previously in `hashing` (if it was not, `ans` increases by 0), `n` remains as the integer value of `data[15]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is now 0.
