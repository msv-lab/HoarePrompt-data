Output State: `current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` is the total length of the array `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all consecutive pairs in the array `a`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs `n-1` times. The `hashing` dictionary will have keys for each element in `a` that appears more than once, with their respective values being the cumulative index positions leading up to the last occurrence of that element before it repeats. The variable `ans` will be the sum of these values for all consecutive pairs of identical elements in the array `a`. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
