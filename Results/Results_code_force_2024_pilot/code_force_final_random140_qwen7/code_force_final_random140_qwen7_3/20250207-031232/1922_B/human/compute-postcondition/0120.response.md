Output State: **`current_index` is 41; `results` is `[ans]`; `hashing` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is 0;**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. Since `ans` was already `0` in the initial state, its value does not change. All other variables remain in their initial states.
