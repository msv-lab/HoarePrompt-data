The code `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Initially, `current_index` is 34, so after executing this line of code, `current_index` will be 35. The values of the other variables (`results`, `hashing`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_index` is 35, `results` is `[ans]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is the cumulative sum of values in `hashing` for each key that has consecutive occurrences in `a`, `n` is the integer value of `data[31]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `previous_i + 2` (less than `n`), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[15]` to `data[33]` with the additional element `int(data[32])` and `int(data[33])` appended to it.**
