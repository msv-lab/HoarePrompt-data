Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `current_index` is 13
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `results` is an empty list
   - `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `1`
   - `a` is sorted
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `i` is 3
   - If `a[3]` is equal to `a[2]`, then `ans` is `hashing[a[2]]`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 4.

5. **Final state**:
   - `current_index` remains unchanged at 13
   - `t` remains unchanged within the given range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `results` remains an empty list
   - `hashing` remains a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `1`
   - `a` remains sorted
   - `n` must be greater than 4
   - `i` is now 4

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `1`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4**
