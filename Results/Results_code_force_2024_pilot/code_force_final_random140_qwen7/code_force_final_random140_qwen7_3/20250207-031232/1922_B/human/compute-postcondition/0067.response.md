Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `current_index` is 18
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\)
   - `results` is [ans]
   - `hashing` is an empty dictionary
   - `a` is [int(data[15]), int(data[16])]
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`
   - `i` is `n`

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i = n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same because it is determined by `data[15]` and does not change within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `current_index` remains 18
- `t` remains the same (an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\))
- `results` remains [ans]
- `hashing` remains an empty dictionary
- `a` remains [int(data[15]), int(data[16])]
- `n` remains the integer value of `data[15]`
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i = n + 1`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`current_index` is 18, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[15]), int(data[16])], `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is `n + 1`**
