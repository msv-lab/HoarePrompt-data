Output State: **`current_index` is 19, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[15]), int(data[16]), int(data[18])], `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is `n + 1`**

Explanation: The code appends `int(data[current_index])` to the list `a`. Given that `current_index` is initially 18, after executing the line of code, `current_index` is incremented to 19. The value of `data[18]` is appended to the list `a`, making `a` now contain `[int(data[15]), int(data[16]), int(data[18])]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
