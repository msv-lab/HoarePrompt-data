Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `current_index` is 13 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `results` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `1` (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `a` is sorted (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` must be greater than 4 (relevant to the loop head).
   - `i` is 7 (relevant to the loop head).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n - 1`, and `i` is currently 7, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 8.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the relevant states**:
   - `i` becomes 8.
   - `n` remains greater than 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `1`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 8, `ans` is `hashing[a[6]]`.**
