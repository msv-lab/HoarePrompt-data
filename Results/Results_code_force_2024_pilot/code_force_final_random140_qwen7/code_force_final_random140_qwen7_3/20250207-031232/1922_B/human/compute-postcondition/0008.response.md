Output State: **`current_index` is 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer from `data[current_index]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[current_index]` to `n`, where `current_index` is 2. Therefore, `n` becomes the integer value at `data[2]`. The `current_index` is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
