Output State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 8, `ans` is `hashing[a[6]] + hashing[a[8]]`, which is `0 + 8 = 8**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `hashing[a[i]]`, where `i` is 8. Given that `hashing[a[8]]` is `8`, `ans` is updated to `hashing[a[6]] + 8`. Since `hashing[a[6]]` is `0`, `ans` becomes `0 + 8 = 8`. All other variables remain unchanged.
