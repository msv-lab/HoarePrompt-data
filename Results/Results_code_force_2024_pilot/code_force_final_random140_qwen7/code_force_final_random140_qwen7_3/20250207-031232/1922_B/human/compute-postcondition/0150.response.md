Output State: `current_index` is 43, `results` is `[final_ans]`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key-value pair is of the form `a[i]: i` for every consecutive pair of elements `a[i]` and `a[i+1]` that are equal, and `final_ans` is the sum of all values in the `hashing` dictionary.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `current_index` will be one more than the last index processed, which is 43. The `results` list will contain the final value of `ans`, referred to here as `final_ans`. The `hashing` dictionary will map each element `a[i]` (where `a[i]` is part of a consecutive pair with `a[i+1]`) to the index `i` of the first occurrence of that element in the pair. `final_ans` will be the sum of all these mapped values, which represents the total count of indices for all consecutive pairs of equal elements in the array `a`.
