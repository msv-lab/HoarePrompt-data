The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates a specific value based on the sorted list. This value is related to the cumulative sum of indices where consecutive identical elements are found. The function then prints the calculated value for each test case.
