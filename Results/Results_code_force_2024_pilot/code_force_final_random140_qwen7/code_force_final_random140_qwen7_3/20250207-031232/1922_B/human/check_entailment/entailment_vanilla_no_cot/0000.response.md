Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and inefficiencies. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and then processes it. This approach works but is not the most efficient way to handle multiple test cases. It would be better to process each test case separately.

2. **Hashing Logic**: The program uses a dictionary `hashing` to keep track of the number of previous elements. However, this logic is incorrect for counting the number of valid triplets that can form a triangle. Specifically, for three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.

3. **Triangle Inequality Check**: The program does not implement the triangle inequality check (`a[i] + a[j] > a[k]`, `a[i] + a[k] > a[j]`, `a[j] + a[k] > a[i]`) which is essential for determining if three sticks can form a triangle.

4. **Sorting**: Sorting the array is unnecessary and inefficient for this problem. We can directly use the given array to count valid triplets without sorting.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through the array and count the number of valid triplets `(i, j, k)` such that `a[i] + a[j] > a[k]` and `a[i] < a[j] < a[k]`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[1])
        a = [int(x) for x in data[2:n+2]]
        
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                for k in range(j+1, n):
                    if a[i] + a[j] > a[k]:
                        count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_1()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible triplets and counts those that satisfy the triangle inequality condition. This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle.
