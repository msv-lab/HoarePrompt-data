You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    current_index = 0
    t = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        hashing = {}
        n = int(data[current_index])
        current_index += 1
        a = []
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(int(data[current_index]))
            current_index += 1
        a.sort()
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if a[i] not in hashing:
                hashing[a[i]] = 0
            hashing[a[i]] += i
            if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
                ans += hashing[a[i]]
        results.append(ans)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates a specific value based on the sorted list. This value is related to the cumulative sum of indices where consecutive identical elements are found. The function then prints the calculated value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. However, the program attempts to solve a different problem related to counting pairs of indices with equal values in the sorted array.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
3
4
1 1 1 1
```

The expected output for this test case is `4`, because there are 4 ways to choose 3 sticks with the same length (each combination of three sticks of length 1).

However, the provided program will output `0` for this test case, which is incorrect. This is because the program is counting pairs of indices with equal values, not solving the triangle formation problem.

The program should iterate through the sorted array and check the conditions for forming a triangle (i.e., the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_triangle_ways(n, a):
    a.sort()
    count = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        k = i + 2
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
            while k < n and a[i] + a[j] > a[k]:
                k += 1
            count += k - j - 1
    return count

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    current_index = 0
    t = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[current_index])
        current_index += 1
        a = []
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(int(data[current_index]))
            current_index += 1
        results.append(count_triangle_ways(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_1()
```

This corrected program should now correctly count the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles from the given sticks.
