### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to perform a series of operations on an array `a` of length `n`.
   - For each operation, we select an index `i` (where `1 ≤ i ≤ n`), insert `a[i] + i` into a set `S`, and remove `a[i]` from `a`.
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain unique values.
   - We then sort `S` in descending order to form array `b`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It initializes an empty set `st`.
   - It iterates over the array `arr`, adding `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. This ensures that each value added to `st` is unique.
   - Finally, it prints the sorted set `st` in descending order.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic of adding `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st` is correct because it ensures that each value is unique.
   - However, the code does not correctly implement the selection of index `i` in step 1. Instead, it simply iterates over the entire array, which does not guarantee that the maximum possible values are inserted into the set `st`.
   - The problem requires selecting the optimal index `i` in each operation to maximize the lexicographically largest array `b`. The current implementation does not consider this optimization.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the general case where all elements in `arr` are distinct and within the specified range.
   - However, it does not handle the scenario where the optimal index `i` is not selected in each iteration, leading to suboptimal results.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` because it does not ensure that the optimal index `i` is selected in each operation. The current implementation simply adds `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st` without considering the optimal choice of `i`.

### Correctness:
**False**
