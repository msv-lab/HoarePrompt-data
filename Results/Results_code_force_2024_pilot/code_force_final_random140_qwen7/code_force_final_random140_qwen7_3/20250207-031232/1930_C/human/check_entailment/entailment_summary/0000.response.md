Reasoning:
1. The problem requires selecting an index \(i\) such that \(1 \leq i \leq |a|\), inserting \(a_i + i\) into the set \(S\), and deleting \(a_i\) from the array \(a\). This process is repeated \(n\) times until \(a\) is empty.
2. The goal is to find the lexicographically largest array \(b\) which is the sorted set \(S\) in descending order.
3. The provided code defines a function `func_1()` that reads the input, constructs the set \(S\) with the required values, sorts it in descending order, and prints the result.
4. The code correctly adds \(a_i + i + 1\) to the set \(S\) instead of just \(a_i + i\), which ensures that no duplicates are added since sets automatically handle uniqueness.
5. The set is then sorted in descending order and printed, which matches the requirement to produce the lexicographically largest array \(b\).

Given the above points, the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
