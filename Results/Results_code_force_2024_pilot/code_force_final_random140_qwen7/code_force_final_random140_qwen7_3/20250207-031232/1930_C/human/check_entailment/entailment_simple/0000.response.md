Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop in `func_1()` iterates from `0` to `n-1`, but the problem specifies that the operation should be performed exactly `n` times, selecting an index `i` such that `1 \leq i \leq |a|`. The current implementation adds `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`, which does not match the problem's requirement of adding `arr[i] + i` to the set.

2. **Incorrect Set Construction**: The set `st` should contain `arr[i] + i` for each `i` from `1` to `n`, not `arr[i] + i + 1`.

3. **Output Order**: The program sorts the set `st` in reverse order and prints the result, which is correct. However, the set construction is incorrect.

Given these points, the current implementation does not follow the problem's specifications and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
