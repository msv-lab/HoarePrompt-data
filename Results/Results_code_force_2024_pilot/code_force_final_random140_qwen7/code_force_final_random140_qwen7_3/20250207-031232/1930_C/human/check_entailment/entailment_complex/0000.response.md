Reasoning:
The annotated program does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Set Construction**: The set `st` is constructed by adding `arr[i] + i + 1` for each `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`. However, according to the problem statement, the correct expression to add to the set should be `arr[i] + i`.

2. **Incorrect Deletion Logic**: The problem statement mentions that after each operation, the element `a_i` is deleted from `a` and the indices of all elements to the right of `a_i` decrease by 1. This implies that the array `a` should be modified accordingly after each operation, but the provided code does not reflect this logic. Instead, it constructs a set based on the initial array without any modifications.

3. **Sorting and Output**: The set `st` is sorted in descending order and printed. While this part is correct, it is based on an incorrect construction of the set.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
