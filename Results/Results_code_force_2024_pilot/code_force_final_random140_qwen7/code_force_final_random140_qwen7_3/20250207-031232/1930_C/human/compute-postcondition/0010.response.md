Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `st` is a set containing the values `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[3] + 4`, and `arr[i-1] + i`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The set `st` will contain all the values of `arr[i] + i + 1` for every `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Specifically, it contains `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[3] + 4`, and `arr[n-1] + n` (since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`).
