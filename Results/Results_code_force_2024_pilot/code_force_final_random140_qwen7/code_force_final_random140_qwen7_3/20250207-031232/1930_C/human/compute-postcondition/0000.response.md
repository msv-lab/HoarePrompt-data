Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is still valid. The new variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input, which is constrained to be between \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
