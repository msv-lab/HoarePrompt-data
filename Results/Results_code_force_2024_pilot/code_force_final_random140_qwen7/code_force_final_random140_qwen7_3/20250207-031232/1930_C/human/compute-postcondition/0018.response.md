Output State: **`arr` is a list of sums sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, `x` is the next element in `arr` (i.e., `arr[previous_index + 2]`), `ans` has the last element decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of the last element in `ans` minus 1 to `ans`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the elements in `arr` or `ans`, only the fact that `ans` has its last element decremented by 1 is updated. The rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.
