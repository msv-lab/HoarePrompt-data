Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `st` is a set containing the values 5 and 8, `arr[4] + 5` is added to the set `st`.**

Explanation: The code adds `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. Given that `i` is 4, the expression `arr[i] + i + 1` becomes `arr[4] + 5`. Since `st` initially contains the values `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[3] + 4`, which are 5 and 8 respectively (assuming `arr[0]` is 4 and `arr[3]` is 4), the new value `arr[4] + 5` is added to the set. The values of `i`, `n`, and the initial elements of `st` remain unchanged.
