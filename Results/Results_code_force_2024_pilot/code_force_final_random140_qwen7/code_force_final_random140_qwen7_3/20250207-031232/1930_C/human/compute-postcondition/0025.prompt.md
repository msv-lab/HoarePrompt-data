You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(sum, enumerate(map(int, input().split()), start=1)))
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    ans = [arr[0]]
    for x in arr[1:]:
        if x >= ans[-1]:
            ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        else:
            ans.append(x)
        
    #State: The list `ans` contains the first element of `arr` followed by a series of decremented values or the original values from `arr`, depending on the comparison condition.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: 5 4 3 2 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` for each test case defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it returns a result based on the conditions specified, which could be either a specific value or an error message if the input does not meet the criteria.

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
