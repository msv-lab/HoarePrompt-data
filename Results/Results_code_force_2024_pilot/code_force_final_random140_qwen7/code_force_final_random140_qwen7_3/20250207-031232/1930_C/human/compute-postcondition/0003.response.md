Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting value of the range function).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Initially, `i` is 0, so the loop will execute as long as `0 < n`, which is always true given the constraints on `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0 and `n` is an input integer within the specified range, no adjustments are needed for `i` or `n` to ensure the loop can execute.
   - The other variables (`t`, `arr`, and `st`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)**
