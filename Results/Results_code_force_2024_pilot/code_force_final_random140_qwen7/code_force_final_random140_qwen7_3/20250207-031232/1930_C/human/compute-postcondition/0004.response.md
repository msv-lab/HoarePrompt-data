Output State: **`i` is 1; `st` is a set containing the value `arr[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. Initially, `i` is 0. So, the expression `arr[i] + i + 1` becomes `arr[0] + 0 + 1`, which simplifies to `arr[0] + 1`. This value is added to the set `st`. After executing the line, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
