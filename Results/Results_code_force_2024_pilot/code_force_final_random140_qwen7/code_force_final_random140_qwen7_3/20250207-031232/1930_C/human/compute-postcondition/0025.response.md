Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` for each test case defined by an integer `t`. It sorts the list in descending order, then iterates through the sorted list to create a new list `ans`. For each element in the sorted list, if the element is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, it appends the last element of `ans` decremented by one. Otherwise, it appends the current element from the sorted list. Finally, it prints the resulting list `ans`.**
