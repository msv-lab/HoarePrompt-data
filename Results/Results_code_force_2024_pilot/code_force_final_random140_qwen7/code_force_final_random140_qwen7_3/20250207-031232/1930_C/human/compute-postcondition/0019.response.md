Output State: **`arr` is a list of sums sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `x` is the next element in `arr` (i.e., `arr[previous_index + 2]`); `ans` is a list that has appended `x`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `ans`. The values of `arr` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `arr` remains a list of sums sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, and `x` remains the next element in `arr` (i.e., `arr[previous_index + 2]`). The list `ans` now includes the value of `x`.
