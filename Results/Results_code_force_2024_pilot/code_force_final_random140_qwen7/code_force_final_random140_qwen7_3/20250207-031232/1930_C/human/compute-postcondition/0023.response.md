To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The list `ans` contains the first element of `arr` followed by a series of decremented values or the original values from `arr`, depending on the comparison condition.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(*ans)` will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the initial state, we need to understand how `ans` is constructed. Since the exact construction logic isn't provided, we'll consider the general behavior described.

- `ans` starts with the first element of `arr`.
- Subsequent elements in `ans` could either be the next decrement of the previous element or the same value as the previous element, depending on some unspecified comparison condition.

Without the exact comparison condition, we can only describe `ans` in a general form. Let's assume the simplest case where the comparison condition always results in the next decrement of the previous element.

For example, if `arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, then `ans` might look like this:
- Start with the first element of `arr`: `5`
- Next element is `5 - 1 = 4`
- Next element is `4 - 1 = 3`
- And so on...

So, `ans` could be `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

Therefore, the print statement `print(*ans)` would print these elements separated by spaces.

Output: **5 4 3 2 1**
