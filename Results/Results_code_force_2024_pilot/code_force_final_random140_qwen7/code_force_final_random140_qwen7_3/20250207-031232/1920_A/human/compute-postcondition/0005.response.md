Output State: **`start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.**

The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `t` and the second integer to `v`. The values of `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
