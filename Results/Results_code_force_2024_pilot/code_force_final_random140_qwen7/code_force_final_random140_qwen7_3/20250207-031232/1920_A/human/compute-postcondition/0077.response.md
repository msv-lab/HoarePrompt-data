Output State: `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` contains all elements that are within the range `[start, end]`, and `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `start` will still be the smallest value of `v` where `t` equals 1, and `end` will still be the largest value of `v` where `t` equals 2. The list `num` will only include those elements that are within the range defined by `start` and `end`. Finally, `count_num` will hold the total count of elements from the original `num` that lie within this specified range.
