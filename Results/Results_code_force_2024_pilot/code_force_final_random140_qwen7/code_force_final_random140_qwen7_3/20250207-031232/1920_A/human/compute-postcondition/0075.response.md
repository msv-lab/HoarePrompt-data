Postcondition: `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` must contain at least one element, and `count_num` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the loop continues. If `i` is within the range `[start, end]`, `count_num` becomes 2.
