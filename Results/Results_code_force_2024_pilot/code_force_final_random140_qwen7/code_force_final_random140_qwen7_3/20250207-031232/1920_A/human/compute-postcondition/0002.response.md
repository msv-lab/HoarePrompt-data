Output State: **`start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is a list of integers**

Explanation: The code snippet `end = int(1000000000.0)` does not change the value of `end`. It explicitly casts `1000000000.0` to an integer, which remains `1000000000`. The value of `start` and the list `num` remain unchanged from their initial states.
