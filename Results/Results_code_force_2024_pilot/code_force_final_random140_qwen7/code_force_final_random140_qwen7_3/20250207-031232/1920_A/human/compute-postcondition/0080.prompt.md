You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, start is initialized to -1, end is initialized to 1000000000, num is a list of integers, and for each constraint (t, v), t is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3} and v is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 1000000000.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` equals 3, and `i` is `n-1`.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` contains all elements that are within the range `[start, end]`, and `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `start` will still be the smallest value of `v` where `t` equals 1, and `end` will still be the largest value of `v` where `t` equals 2. The list `num` will only include those elements that are within the range defined by `start` and `end`. Finally, `count_num` will hold the total count of elements from the original `num` that lie within this specified range.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus `count_num`, but only if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It calculates the difference between `end` and `start`, adds one to the result, subtracts `count_num`, but only if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus `count_num`, but only if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
