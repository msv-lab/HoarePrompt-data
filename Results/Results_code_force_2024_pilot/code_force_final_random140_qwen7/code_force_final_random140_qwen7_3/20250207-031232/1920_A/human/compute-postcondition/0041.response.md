Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `start` is `v`
   - `end` is `v`
   - `num` is a list containing `[v, v]`
   - `i` is 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in `range(n)`.
   - We need to determine the value of `n` based on the given information.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know the postconditions if `t` equals 3.
   - If `t` equals 3, the function sets `start` and `end` to `v`, appends `v` to the list `num`, and keeps `i` as 1.

4. **Determining `n`:**
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, `n` must be the number of iterations required for the loop to execute.
   - Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the loop will run for `n = 1` iteration (since `i` starts at 1 and the loop condition is `range(n)`).

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `2`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `start` remains `v`
   - `end` remains `v`
   - `num` remains `[v, v]`
   - `i` becomes `2`

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v, v]`, `i` is 2**
