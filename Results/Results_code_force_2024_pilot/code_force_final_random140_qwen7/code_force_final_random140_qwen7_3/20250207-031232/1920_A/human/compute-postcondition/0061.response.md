Output State: **The current value of `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, `count_num` is 0, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `start`, `end`, `num`, and `count_num` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the current value of `i` also remains the same.
