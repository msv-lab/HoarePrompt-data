Output State: **`start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` equals 3, and `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `start` will hold the smallest value of `v` encountered when `t` was 1, `end` will hold the largest value of `v` encountered when `t` was 2, `num` will be a list containing every `v` that was appended when `t` was 3, and `i` will be set to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `n` iterations.
