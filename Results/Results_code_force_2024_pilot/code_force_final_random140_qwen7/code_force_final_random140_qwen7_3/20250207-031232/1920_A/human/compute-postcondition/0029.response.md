Output State: **`start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer input, `v` is the second integer input**

Explanation: The line `start = v` simply reassigns the value of `v` to `start`. Since `v` is the second integer input, `start` now holds the same value as `v`. The other variables remain unchanged.
