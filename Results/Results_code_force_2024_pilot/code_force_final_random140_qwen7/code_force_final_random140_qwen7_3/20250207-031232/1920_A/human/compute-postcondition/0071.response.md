Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `num`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `num`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1.
   - `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2.
   - `num` must contain at least one element.
   - `count_num` is either 1 or 2.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `num` must still contain at least one element.
   - The loop variable `i` will take the next value from `num`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, and `i` will be set to the next element in `num`, we need to ensure `num` still contains at least one element.
   - `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `start` remains the same.
   - `end` remains the same.
   - `num` must still contain at least one element.
   - `count_num` remains either 1 or 2 (it does not affect the loop continuation).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` must contain at least one element, and `count_num` is either 1 or 2**.
