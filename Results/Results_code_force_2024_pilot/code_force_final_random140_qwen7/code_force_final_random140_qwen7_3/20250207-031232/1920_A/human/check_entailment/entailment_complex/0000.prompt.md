Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each test case, there are exactly n lines describing constraints where each line contains two integers a and x such that a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
def func_1(isOne):
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer input provided by the user, which is constrained by the conditions 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Additionally, for each test case, there are exactly n lines describing constraints where each line contains two integers a and x such that a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The variable `isOne` remains false.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is false, it returns an integer input provided by the user, constrained by the conditions 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Additionally, for each test case, there are exactly n lines describing constraints where each line contains two integers a and x such that a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. If `isOne` is true, it returns 1. After the function concludes, the variable `isOne` retains its original value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of n constraints where n is an integer. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer. Constraints of type 1 indicate k must be greater than or equal to x, constraints of type 2 indicate k must be less than or equal to x, and constraints of type 3 indicate k must not be equal to x.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. If the condition of the if statement evaluates to true, `line` is a string containing space-separated values, `items` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` on spaces. Otherwise, `line` is assigned the value of input(), and `items` is a list containing the characters of `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers obtained by converting each string in the list 'items' to an integer.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list 'items' containing the characters of the string 'line' that was obtained from input().
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `space` and `to_int`. Based on the value of `space`, it reads an input line and splits it into either a list of strings or a list of characters. If `to_int` is True, it converts each element in the list to an integer and returns a list of integers. If `to_int` is False, it simply returns the list of strings or characters.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and sym is a string representing a separator (e.g., ' ', ',', etc.).
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least three integers, `i` takes on each element of `arr` in order, converted to a string and concatenated with `sym`, and `string` is the concatenation of all elements of `arr` converted to strings and separated by `sym`.
    return string
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of all elements of `arr` converted to strings and separated by `sym`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It converts all elements in `arr` to strings and concatenates them using `sym` as the separator, then returns the resulting string.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string, substring is a non-empty string, and substring is guaranteed to appear in string at least once.
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `indices` is a list containing all the positions where `substring` is found in `string`, and `index` is -1.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `indices` will contain every position in `string` where `substring` was found, starting from the initial `index` and moving one character ahead each time. The loop continues until `substring` is no longer found in `string`, at which point `index` is set to -1 and the loop terminates.
    return indices
    #`indices` is a list containing all the positions where `substring` is found in `string`, and `index` is -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string and a substring. It searches for all occurrences of the substring within the string and returns a list containing the starting positions of these occurrences. If the substring is not found (which is not possible given the problem constraints), the function returns a list of positions and an index set to -1.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and element is an integer present in the list arr.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #A list of indices where the integer 'element' is found in the list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `element` present in `arr`, and returns a list of indices where `element` is found in `arr`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each inner list has at least 'index' + 1 elements, and 'value' is an integer.
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: Output State: The function will either return a subArray from the list 'arr' whose index-th element is equal to 'value', or it will return None if no such subArray exists in the entire list.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, if any subArray in 'arr' has its 'index'-th element equal to 'value', the function will return that subArray. Otherwise, since the loop checks every subArray in 'arr' and none of them had their 'index'-th element equal to 'value', the function will return None.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` searches through a list of lists (`arr`) for a subArray where the element at the specified `index` matches the given `value`. If such a subArray is found, it is returned. If no matching subArray is found, the function returns the next subArray in the list. If no suitable subArray is found after checking all conditions, it returns `None`.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, start is initialized to -1, end is initialized to 1000000000, num is a list of integers, and for each constraint (t, v), t is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3} and v is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 1000000000.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` equals 3, and `i` is `n-1`.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` contains all elements that are within the range `[start, end]`, and `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `start` will still be the smallest value of `v` where `t` equals 1, and `end` will still be the largest value of `v` where `t` equals 2. The list `num` will only include those elements that are within the range defined by `start` and `end`. Finally, `count_num` will hold the total count of elements from the original `num` that lie within this specified range.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus `count_num`, but only if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of inputs to determine the minimum and maximum values (`start` and `end`) and a list of numbers (`num`). It then counts how many numbers in `num` fall within the range defined by `start` and `end`. Finally, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus the count of numbers within the range, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0.
