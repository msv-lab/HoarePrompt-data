Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how the solution works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `10^9`. These variables will be used to keep track of the minimum and maximum possible values for `k`.

2. **Reading Constraints**: It reads the number of constraints `n` and then iterates over each constraint. For each constraint:
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`t == 1`), it updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and the constraint's value `v`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`t == 2`), it updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and the constraint's value `v`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`t == 3`), it adds the value `v` to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Values**: After processing all constraints, it counts the number of values in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`. It then calculates the total number of valid values by subtracting this count from the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where `start` is greater than `end` by returning `0`, indicating that no values of `k` satisfy all constraints.

The functions `func_1` to `func_7` are utility functions that are not directly used in the main logic but are present in the code. They do not affect the correctness of the solution.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the provided program is correct.
