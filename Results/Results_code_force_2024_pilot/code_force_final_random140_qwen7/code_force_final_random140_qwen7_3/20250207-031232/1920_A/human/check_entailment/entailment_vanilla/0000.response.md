Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints.
2. The constraints are of three types:
   - Type 1: `k >= x`
   - Type 2: `k <= x`
   - Type 3: `k != x`
3. We need to find the range of valid `k` values, considering the constraints, and subtract the invalid `k` values (those specified in Type 3 constraints).
4. The provided code in `func_7` attempts to solve this problem but does not correctly handle the logic for determining the valid range and counting the valid `k` values.
5. Specifically, `func_7` initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000`, which are arbitrary values. These should be initialized to the minimum and maximum possible values of `x` from the constraints.
6. The function correctly updates `start` and `end` based on Type 1 and Type 2 constraints, respectively.
7. However, the handling of Type 3 constraints (`k != x`) is incorrect. The function simply counts how many `x` values from Type 3 constraints fall within the range `[start, end]` and subtracts this count from the total range size. This approach is flawed because it doesn't account for the fact that `k` cannot be any of these specific values.
8. A correct approach would be to use a set to store the invalid `k` values from Type 3 constraints and then subtract the size of this set from the range size `[start, end]`.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
