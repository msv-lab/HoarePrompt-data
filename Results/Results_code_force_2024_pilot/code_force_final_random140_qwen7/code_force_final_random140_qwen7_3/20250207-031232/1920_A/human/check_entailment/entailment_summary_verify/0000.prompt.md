You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function processes a series of inputs to determine the minimum and maximum values (`start` and `end`) and a list of numbers (`num`). It then counts how many numbers in `num` fall within the range defined by `start` and `end`. Finally, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus the count of numbers within the range, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the third type of constraint (k must be not equal to some integer x). The program attempts to count the number of valid k values by setting `start` to the maximum of all lower bounds and `end` to the minimum of all upper bounds, and then subtracting the count of values that violate the "not equal" constraints from the total range. However, this approach fails to correctly exclude all values that are not equal to the specified values in the "not equal" constraints.

For example, consider the following input:
- Number of constraints: 4
- Constraints: 
  1. \( k \geq 3 \)
  2. \( k \leq 10 \)
  3. \( k \neq 1 \)
  4. \( k \neq 5 \)

The program would set `start` to 3 and `end` to 10, and then check if 1 and 5 are within this range. Since both 1 and 5 are outside the range [3, 10], the program would incorrectly conclude that there are 8 valid values (from 3 to 10 inclusive), instead of the correct 7 values (3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly exclude the values specified in the "not equal" constraints from the range between `start` and `end`. This can be done by iterating through the list of values to exclude and decrementing the count accordingly.
