Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input format and ensures that the constraints are read properly. The functions `func_2` and `func_7` are used appropriately to parse the input constraints.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - For constraints of type 1 (`k >= x`), the program updates the `start` variable to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - For constraints of type 2 (`k <= x`), the program updates the `end` variable to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - For constraints of type 3 (`k != x`), the program appends the value `x` to the list `num`.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program calculates the number of valid `k` values that lie within the range `[start, end]` but exclude the values in `num`.
   - The formula `end - start + 1 - count_num` correctly computes the number of integers in the range `[start, end]` excluding the values in `num`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `start > end`, returning 0 in such scenarios.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
