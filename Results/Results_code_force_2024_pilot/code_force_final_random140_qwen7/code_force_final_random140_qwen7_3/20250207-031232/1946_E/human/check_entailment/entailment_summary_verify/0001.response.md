### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate in pointing out that the provided program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. The given functions `func_1` and `func_2` are utility functions for modular arithmetic and do not address the combinatorial logic required to count the permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.

To further validate this, let's consider the following points:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires counting the number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions. This involves complex combinatorial logic, including handling overlapping maximums and ensuring the constraints are met.

2. **Given Functions**: 
   - `func_1` computes the modular multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. While this is a useful utility function, it is not relevant to solving the main problem.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to perform modular arithmetic operations. Again, this is a utility function and does not address the combinatorial logic needed.

3. **Lack of Core Logic**: The program does not include any code that processes the input indices of prefix and suffix maximums to count the valid permutations. Without this core logic, the program cannot solve the problem as stated.

Since the provided code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it lacks the essential combinatorial logic required to count the permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
