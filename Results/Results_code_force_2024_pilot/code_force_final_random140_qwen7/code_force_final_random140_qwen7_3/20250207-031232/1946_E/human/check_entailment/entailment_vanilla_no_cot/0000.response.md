Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code includes two helper functions `func_1` and `func_2`, but these functions do not seem to be directly related to solving the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The problem requires a more complex algorithm that involves understanding the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums and calculating the number of valid permutations accordingly. The given functions appear to be related to modular multiplicative inverses or extended Euclidean algorithm, which are not directly applicable to the problem's requirements.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to implement logic that takes into account the positions of prefix and suffix maximums and calculates the number of valid permutations based on these positions, ensuring that the constraints are respected. The current implementation does not address the core logic required to solve the problem as described.
