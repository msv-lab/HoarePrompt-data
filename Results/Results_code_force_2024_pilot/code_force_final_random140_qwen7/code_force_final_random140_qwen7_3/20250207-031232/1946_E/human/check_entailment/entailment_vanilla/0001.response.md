### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy given conditions regarding prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution involves combinatorial calculations and constraints handling.

2. **Key Components of the Solution:**
   - **Function `func_1`:** This function calculates a specific combinatorial value using modular arithmetic.
   - **Function `func_2`:** This function processes the input and uses `func_1` to compute the result.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates a factorial-based value under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It handles edge cases where `n1 == n2`, `n2 == 0`, and performs modular multiplicative inverses.

4. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - **Input Handling:** Reads the length `n`, number of prefix maximums `M1`, and number of suffix maximums `M2`.
   - **Validation Checks:**
     - Ensures the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index.
     - Ensures the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`.
     - Handles special cases where multiple prefix/suffix maximums are close to each other.
   - **Combinatorial Calculation:**
     - Uses `func_1` to calculate the number of valid permutations.
     - Adjusts the calculation based on the positions of prefix and suffix maximums.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The code correctly handles edge cases like when there are no prefix or suffix maximums.
   - The logic for adjusting the combinatorial value based on the positions of maximums is sound.

6. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic (`% MOD`) ensures the result fits within the required bounds.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the functions and their interactions, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the number of valid permutations based on the given constraints. The code handles all specified cases and performs the necessary calculations accurately.

**Correctness: True**
