Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The solution involves calculating combinations using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - **Input Parsing**: The code correctly parses the input to get \( n \), \( m_1 \), \( m_2 \), the indices of prefix maximums (`p`), and the indices of suffix maximums (`s`).
   - **Edge Case Handling**: The code checks if the last index of prefix maximums matches the first index of suffix maximums, and if the first index of prefix maximums is 1 and the last index of suffix maximums is \( n \). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations.
   - **Combination Calculation**: The code uses the `func_2` function to calculate combinations using the results from `func_1`. This is done for both prefix and suffix parts of the permutation.
   - **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are performed under modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.

3. **Verification of Correctness**:
   - **Modular Arithmetic**: The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the intermediate and final results do not overflow.
   - **Combination Calculation**: The combination calculation is correctly implemented using the `func_2` function, which leverages the extended Euclidean algorithm (`func_1`) to compute modular inverses.
   - **Edge Cases**: The edge case handling ensures that invalid configurations (like mismatched indices) are correctly identified and handled by returning 0.
   - **Example Verification**: The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the code, producing the expected outputs.

Given the above points, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
