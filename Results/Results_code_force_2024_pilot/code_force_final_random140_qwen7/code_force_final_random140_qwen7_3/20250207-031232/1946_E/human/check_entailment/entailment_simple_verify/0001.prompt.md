You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums in a permutation.
   - We need to count the number of permutations that could have these prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A prefix maximum at index \(i\) means that the element at \(i\) is greater than all elements before it.
   - A suffix maximum at index \(j\) means that the element at \(j\) is greater than all elements after it.
   - The intersection of prefix and suffix maximums must be handled carefully, as they might overlap.

3. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - `func_2(a, b)` uses `func_1` to compute \(a \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

4. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse.
   - The function `func_2` correctly uses this inverse to perform modular arithmetic.

5. **Relevance to the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting permutations, which involves combinatorial logic rather than just modular arithmetic.
   - The given functions do not address the core combinatorial logic required to solve the problem.

6. **Missing Logic:**
   - The program does not implement any logic to count the permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It only provides utility functions for modular arithmetic, which are not sufficient to solve the problem.

### Conclusion

The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. It only provides utility functions for modular arithmetic but lacks the combinatorial logic needed to count the permutations.
