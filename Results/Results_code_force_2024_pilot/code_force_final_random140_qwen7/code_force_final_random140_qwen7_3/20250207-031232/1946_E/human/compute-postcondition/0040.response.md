Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `nums_left - 4`, `i` is `i - 1`, `cur` is unchanged, `ans` is updated according to the rule: `ans = ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD` if `i` equals `L[cur]`, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left - 3) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code `i -= 1` decreases the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial state mentions that `i` must be greater than 1, this operation does not affect the condition that `i` must be greater than 1. The value of `nums_left` is updated to `nums_left - 4` because it was already `nums_left - 3` before this line of code, and now it is decreased by 1 more. The value of `cur` remains unchanged, and the update rule for `ans` depends on whether `i` equals `L[cur]`, which is not affected by the decrement of `i`.
