Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` is equal to `M1 - 2`, `i` is equal to `1 - N`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nums_left` to `N - R[0] - 1`. The other variables (`cur`, `i`, `ans`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `MOD`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, and `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid as no code has altered these conditions.
