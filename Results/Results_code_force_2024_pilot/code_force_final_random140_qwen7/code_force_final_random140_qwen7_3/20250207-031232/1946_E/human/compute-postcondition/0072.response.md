Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 4`, `cur` is equal to either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `i` is less than `N`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 4) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, or `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid.**

Explanation: The line `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. Since `nums_left` was initially equal to `N - R[0] - 3`, after executing this line, `nums_left` becomes `N - R[0] - 4`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
