Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - 3`, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. Given that `L[-1]` is greater than 2, the initial value of `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. After decrementing, `nums_left` becomes `L[-1] - 3`. All other variables (`cur`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `MOD`, `ans`, `L[0]`, `R[-1]`, and the condition `L[-2] != R[1]`) remain unchanged.
