Output State: `nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - (N - R[0])`, `cur` is equal to a value between 1 and `N - R[0]`, `i` is equal to `N`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) * ... * 1 % MOD` if `i` is not equal to any `R[cur]` during the loop, or a product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and some `nums_left` values if `i` equals any `R[cur]` during the loop, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `nums_left` will be reduced by one for each iteration until it reaches `N - R[0] - (N - R[0]) = 0`. The variable `cur` will increment up to a value that is within the range of indices for `R`. The variable `i` will increment until it reaches `N`. The variable `ans` will be updated in each iteration based on whether `i` equals `R[cur]`. If `i` does not equal `R[cur]`, `ans` is updated by multiplying with `nums_left` and taking modulo `MOD`. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, `ans` is updated without reducing `nums_left`. The final value of `ans` will be the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and a series of `nums_left` values, depending on how many times `i` matched `R[cur]` during the loop.
