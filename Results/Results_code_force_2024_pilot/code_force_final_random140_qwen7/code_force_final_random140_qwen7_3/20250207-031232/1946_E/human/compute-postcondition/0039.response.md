Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `nums_left - 3`, `i` must be greater than 1. If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is updated according to the rule: `ans = ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left - 3) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. Since `nums_left` was initially equal to `nums_left - 2`, after executing the code, `nums_left` becomes `nums_left - 3`. The conditions and rules for updating `cur` and `ans` remain unchanged.
