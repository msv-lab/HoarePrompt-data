Postcondition: `nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` is equal to either 1 or 2, `i` is equal to `R[0] + 1`, `ans` is either the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD` or `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid, and `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`. Additionally, if `i` equals `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 1; otherwise, `cur` is 2.
