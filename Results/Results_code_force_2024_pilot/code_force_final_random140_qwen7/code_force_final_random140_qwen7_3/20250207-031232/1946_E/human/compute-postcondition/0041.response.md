Output State: `nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - (3 * (N - 1))`, `i` is equal to 0, `cur` is equal to `M1 - 2`, `ans` is updated according to the rules defined within the loop, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Explanation: The loop continues until `i` becomes 0. Since `i` starts from `L[-1] - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration, it will take `L[-1] - 1` iterations for `i` to reach 0. Given that the loop executes 3 times as per the provided states, we can infer that `L[-1] - 1` is at least 3. Therefore, after all iterations, `nums_left` will be reduced by `(L[-1] - 1)` for each of the `N-1` iterations, resulting in `nums_left` being equal to `L[-1] - (3 * (N - 1))`. Since `i` is decremented in each iteration and starts from `L[-1] - 1`, it will become 0 after `N - 1` iterations. The value of `cur` remains unchanged because the condition `L[cur]` is only met when `i` equals `L[cur]`, which does not happen in the given iterations. The variable `ans` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop, but its exact value depends on the specific sequence of operations during each iteration.
