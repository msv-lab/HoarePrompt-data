Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 4`, `cur` is equal to either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `i` is less than `N` and has been incremented by 1, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 4) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, or `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but its specific new value is not given. All other variables retain their original conditions and values. The calculation for `ans` remains the same based on the condition of `i` relative to `R[cur]`.
