Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` (an integer) and `b` (a list of integers). It calls another function `func_1` with `b` and a prime number (10^9 + 7) as arguments. After obtaining the result from `func_1`, which is a tuple containing two integers, the function multiplies the first element of the tuple by `a`, then takes the result modulo 1000000007. The function returns this final computed value.**
