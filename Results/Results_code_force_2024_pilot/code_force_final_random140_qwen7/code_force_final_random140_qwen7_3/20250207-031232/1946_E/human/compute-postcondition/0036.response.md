Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `nums_left - 2`, `i` must be greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left - 2) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Since `nums_left` was initially equal to `nums_left - 2`, the new value of `nums_left` is now `nums_left - 2`. The other conditions (`i` must be greater than 1) remain unchanged. The updated value of `ans` is `ans * (nums_left - 2) % MOD`.
