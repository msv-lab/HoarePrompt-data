Output State: **The program returns 1 and -(a // b - 1)**

Given the initial state where `a` is divisible by `b` (i.e., `a % b == 0`), and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the expression `a // b` computes the integer division of `a` by `b`. This means the result is the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`.

The second part of the return statement is `- (a // b - 1)`. Since `a` is divisible by `b`, `a // b` gives an integer value which is the quotient. Subtracting 1 from this quotient and then negating it results in `- (quotient - 1)`.

So, if `a // b = q` (where `q` is the quotient), then the expression becomes `- (q - 1)`, which simplifies to `1 - q`.

Therefore, the program returns a tuple containing `1` and `1 - (a // b)`.
