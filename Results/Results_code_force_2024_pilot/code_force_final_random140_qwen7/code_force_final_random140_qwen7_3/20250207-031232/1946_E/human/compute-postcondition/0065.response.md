Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 3`, `cur` is equal to either 1, 2, or 3, `i` is less than `N`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 3) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, or `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid, and `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. Since `nums_left` was initially equal to `N - R[0] - 2`, after executing this line, `nums_left` becomes `N - R[0] - 3`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
