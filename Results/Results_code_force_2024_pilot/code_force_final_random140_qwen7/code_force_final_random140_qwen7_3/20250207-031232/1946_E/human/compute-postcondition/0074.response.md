Output State: `nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - (R.length - 1)`, `cur` is equal to a value between 1 and `R.length`, `i` is equal to `N`, `ans` is the result of multiplying `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` by `nums_left` for each iteration where `i` does not equal `R[cur]`, and by `nums_left % MOD` for each iteration where `i` equals `R[cur]`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `nums_left` will be reduced by one for each element in `R` plus one additional decrement for each iteration where `i` does not match any element in `R`. The variable `cur` will be set to the last index it reached within the loop, which is `R.length - 1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `N` since the loop increments `i` until it reaches `N`. The variable `ans` will be the cumulative product of `nums_left` adjusted by the conditions inside the loop, modulo `MOD`.
