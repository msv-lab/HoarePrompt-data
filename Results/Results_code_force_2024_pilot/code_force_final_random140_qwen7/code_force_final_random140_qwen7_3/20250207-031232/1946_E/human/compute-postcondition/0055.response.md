Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` is equal to 1, `i` is equal to `R[0] + 1`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid, and `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `nums_left` remains `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` remains 1, `i` remains `R[0] + 1`, and `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`. The conditions and the additional information about `i` and `N` also remain valid.
