Output State: **The program returns `ans`, which is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) * ... * 1 % MOD` if `i` is not equal to any `R[cur]` during the loop, or a product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and some `nums_left` values if `i` equals any `R[cur]` during the loop, under the conditions that `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, and `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid.**

This means the program returns the value stored in `ans`, which depends on whether `i` matches any `R[cur]` during the loop. If `i` does not match any `R[cur]`, `ans` is calculated as described. If `i` does match any `R[cur]`, `ans` includes the additional factor of `nums_left`. The conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, and `L[-2] != R[1]` must still hold true for these calculations to be valid.
