Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on the results of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the lists `L` and `R` with their respective lengths `M1` and `M2`, and the constant `MOD`. It returns 0 in three cases and `ans`, which is calculated based on specific conditions involving the lists `L` and `R`, in the fourth case.**
