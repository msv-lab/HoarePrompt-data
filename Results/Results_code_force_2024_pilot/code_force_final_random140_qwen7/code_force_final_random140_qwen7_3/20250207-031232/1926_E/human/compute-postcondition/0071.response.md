Output State: **`i` must be greater than 3; `g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2.**

Explanation: The code `g += (h + 1) // 2` increments the value of `g` by the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2. The initial state does not provide specific values for `i` and `h`, but it is stated that `i` must be greater than 3. The value of `g` is updated based on the current value of `h`. The other variables remain unchanged.
