Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.

Explanation: Given the loop condition `while s < k and d > 0:` and the operations inside the loop, we can deduce that `d` will eventually become 0 because it keeps getting halved each iteration until it reaches 0. Once `d` becomes 0, the loop condition `d > 0` fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, `s` will be equal to `d + 1` from the last iteration where `d` was still positive. Since `d` is now 0, `s` will also be 0. The variable `i` will be incremented with each iteration until the loop condition no longer holds true, which happens when `d` becomes 0. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be the total number of iterations, `d` will be 0, and the other variables (`s`, `h`, `p`, `g`) will retain their initial or updated values from the last iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
while p <= i - 1:
    g += (h + 1) // 2
    h -= (h + 1) // 2
    p += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `p` is 2, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2 - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is 3, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` must be greater than or equal to 4; `p` is 4; `h` is `h` minus the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2; `g` is `g` plus the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
