The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `p <= i - 1`. The variables involved in this condition are `p` and `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `i` must be greater than 2.
- `p` is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `p <= i - 1` must be satisfied. Given that `p` is currently 3, the value of `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, `i` must be greater than or equal to 4.

No other states need to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`i` must be greater than or equal to 4, `p` is 3**
