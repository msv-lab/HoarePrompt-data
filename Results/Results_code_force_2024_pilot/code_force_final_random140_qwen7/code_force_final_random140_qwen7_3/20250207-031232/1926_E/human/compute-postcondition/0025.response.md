Output State: **`i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `p` is 1, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The value of `h` is updated by subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from itself. Given that `h` was initially equal to `n`, the new value of `h` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
