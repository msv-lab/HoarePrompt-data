Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `g`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, and `p` remain unchanged, and `g` is now 0.
