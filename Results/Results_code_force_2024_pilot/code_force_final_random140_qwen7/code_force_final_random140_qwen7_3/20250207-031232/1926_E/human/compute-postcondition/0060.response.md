Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `s < k and d > 0`.
2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `k` must be greater than 1
   - `s` is 2
   - `d` is -1
   - `h` is `n`
   - `p` is 1
   - `f` is `k - g`, and `g` is 0, so `f` is `k`

3. **Check the loop condition**:
   - `s < k`: Since `s` is 2 and `k` must be greater than 1, this part of the condition is satisfied as long as `k` is greater than 2.
   - `d > 0`: Since `d` is -1, this part of the condition is not satisfied.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - To satisfy the loop condition `s < k and d > 0`, we need to change the value of `d` to be greater than 0. The value of `d` cannot be changed directly from -1 to a positive number without additional operations, but since we are only allowed to adjust the states in the loop head, we need to consider the constraints given by the loop condition.
   - We can't change `s` because it is already 2 and must remain less than `k` (which must be greater than 2).
   - We can't change `k` because it must be greater than 1 and greater than `s` (which is 2), so it must be greater than 2.
   - We can't change `h`, `p`, `f`, or `g` as they are derived from other variables and not directly adjustable in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `d` to be greater than 0.

**State**: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 1, `s` is 2, `d` must be greater than 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is 0**
