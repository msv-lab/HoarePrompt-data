Output State: **`i` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2 - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is 3, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `p` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
