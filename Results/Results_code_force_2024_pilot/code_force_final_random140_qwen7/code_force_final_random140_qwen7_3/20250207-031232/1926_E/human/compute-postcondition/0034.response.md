Output State: **`i` must be greater than or equal to 4; `p` is 4; `h` is `h` minus the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2; `g` is `g` plus the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2.**

Explanation: The value of `p` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `h` and `g` remain unchanged as they were not directly modified by the code. The precondition that `i` must be greater than or equal to 4 remains valid.
