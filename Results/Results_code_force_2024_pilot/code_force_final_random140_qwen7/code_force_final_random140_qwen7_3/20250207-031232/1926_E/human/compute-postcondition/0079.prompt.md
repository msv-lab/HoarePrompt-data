Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the logarithm base 2 of `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `s` is equal to `i`, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `s < k` and `d > 0`. After each iteration, `s` increases by `(d + 1) // 2` and `d` decreases by the same amount. This process continues until `d` becomes 0. Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to run until `d` reaches 0, which happens when `d` is reduced to 0 after the third iteration. At this point, `i` would be equal to the number of iterations it took to reach this state, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the logarithm base 2 of `n`. The value of `s` will be equal to `i` because `s` increments by 1 with each full cycle of the loop (since `d` is halved each time and eventually becomes 0).
Code of the loop:
while p <= i - 1:
    g += (h + 1) // 2
    h -= (h + 1) // 2
    p += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `s` is equal to `i`, `d` is 0, `h` is now `n - 1`, `p` is 2, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` must be greater than 4; `h` is equal to half of its original value (`(h + 1) // 2`); `p` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` must be greater than 4; `h` is equal to half of its original value minus (half of its original value + 1) // 2; `p` is now `p + 1`; `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
