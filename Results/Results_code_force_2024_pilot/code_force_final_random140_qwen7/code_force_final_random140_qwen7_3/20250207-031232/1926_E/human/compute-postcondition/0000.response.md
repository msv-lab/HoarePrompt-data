Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the input values.

2. **Determine the Input Source**: The loop body processes input from `input()` function. The loop runs as long as there is input available.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). This means there will be `t` test cases.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will run for each test case, meaning it will execute `t` times.

5. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can proceed for all `t` iterations. Specifically, we need to ensure that there are `t` inputs available from `input()`.

6. **Final State After Adjusting**: After adjusting the state, the loop will start with the first test case and continue until all `t` test cases are processed.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the number of test cases `t`, ensuring that the loop can execute for all `t` iterations.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute for all `t` test cases.
