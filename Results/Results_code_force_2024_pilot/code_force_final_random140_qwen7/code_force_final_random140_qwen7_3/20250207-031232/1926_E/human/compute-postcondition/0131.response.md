Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes integers t, n, and k. It returns a value based on the conditions: 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and for each test case, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, and k within specified ranges, and returns a value based on these inputs.
