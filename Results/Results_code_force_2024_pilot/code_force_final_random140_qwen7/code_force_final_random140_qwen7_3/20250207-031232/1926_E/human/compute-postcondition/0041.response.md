Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `n` is an integer input from the user
- `k` is an integer input from the user
- `s` is 0
- `d` is equal to `n`
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print(2 * k - 1)
```

Here, the expression `2 * k - 1` will be evaluated and printed. Since `k` is an integer input from the user and it is guaranteed that `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `2 * k - 1` will be twice the value of `k` minus 1.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 * k - 1**
