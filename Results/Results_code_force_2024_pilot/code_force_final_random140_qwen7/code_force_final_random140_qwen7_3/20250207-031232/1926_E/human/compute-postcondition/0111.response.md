Output State: **`i` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`d`), `n` is `d`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is `n`, `h` is equal to `n - 1`, `p` is 1, `g` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is updated by subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from itself. Initially, `h` is equal to `n`. Since `n` is also equal to `d`, and `d` is the same as the initial value of `n`, `h` starts as `n`. The expression `(h + 1) // 2` evaluates to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. After updating `h`, its new value is `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Given that `n` is at least 4, `(n + 1) // 2` will be an integer, and `h` will be reduced by this integer value. However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we express `h` as `n - 1` because `(n + 1) // 2` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `(n + 1) / 2`, effectively reducing `h` by approximately half of `n + 1`, leaving `h` as `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
