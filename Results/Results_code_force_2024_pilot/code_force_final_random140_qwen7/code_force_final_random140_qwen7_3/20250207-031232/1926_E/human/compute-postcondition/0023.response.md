The loop condition is `while p <= i - 1:`. To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `p` and `i`.

- `p` is initially set to 1.
- `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, but we don't know its exact value yet since the loop hasn't run.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `p <= i - 1` must be true. Given that `p` is initially 1, the condition simplifies to `1 <= i - 1`, which means `i` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**
