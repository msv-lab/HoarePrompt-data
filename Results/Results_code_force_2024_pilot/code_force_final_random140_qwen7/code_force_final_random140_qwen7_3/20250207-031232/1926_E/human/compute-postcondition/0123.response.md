Output State: **`i` is equal to 0, `n` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + 1`, `d` is 1, `h` is equal to 0, `p` is 0, `g` is 0, `f` is `k - 0`**.

Explanation: Initially, `d` is 1, and `i` is calculated as the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\log_2(1)\), which is 0. The loop condition checks if `d > 0`, but since `d` is already 1, it does not enter the loop. Therefore, `p` remains 0, and `g` remains 0. The value of `h` is set to `n - 1 - (n - 1 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `1 - 1 - (1 - 1 + 1) // 2 = 0 - 1 // 2 = 0 - 0 = 0`. After the loop, `f` is calculated as `k - g`, which is `k - 0 = k`. Thus, the final values are as described above.
