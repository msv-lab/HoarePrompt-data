Output State: **`i` must be greater than 3; `h` is equal to half of its original value (`(h + 1) // 2`).**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `i` must be greater than 3 and `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`. The code `h -= (h + 1) // 2` subtracts half of `(h + 1)` from `h`, which means `h` is now equal to `h - (h + 1) // 2`. This simplifies to `h` being equal to half of its original value `(h + 1) // 2`. The condition for `i` remains unchanged.
