Output State: **`i` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `s` is equal to `i`, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `g += (h + 1) // 2` updates the value of `g`. Initially, `h` is equal to `n`, and `g` is 0. The expression `(h + 1) // 2` evaluates to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, `(n + 1) // 2` is a positive integer. Adding this to `g` (which was 0) results in `g` being set to `(n + 1) // 2`. For simplicity and to maintain the condition that `g` is 0 before the addition, we assume `n` is such that `(n + 1) // 2` evaluates to 1 (the smallest positive integer). All other variables remain unchanged.
