Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is (d + 1) // 2, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `s` by adding the value of `(d + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since `d` is equal to `n`, the new value of `s` becomes `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
