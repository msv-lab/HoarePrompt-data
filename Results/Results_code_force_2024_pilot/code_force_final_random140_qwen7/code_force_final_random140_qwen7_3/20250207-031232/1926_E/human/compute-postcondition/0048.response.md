Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is `i + 1`, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` and the series of terms resulting from the operation `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration.**

Explanation: The code `h = n` simply assigns the value of `n` to `h`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `h` is updated to be equal to `n`, while `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `p`, `f`, and `g` retain their original values.
