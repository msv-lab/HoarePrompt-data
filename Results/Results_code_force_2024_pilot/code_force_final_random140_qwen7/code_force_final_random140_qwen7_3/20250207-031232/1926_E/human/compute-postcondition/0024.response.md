Output State: **`i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `g` is incremented by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`. Since `h` is equal to `n`, the expression becomes `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
