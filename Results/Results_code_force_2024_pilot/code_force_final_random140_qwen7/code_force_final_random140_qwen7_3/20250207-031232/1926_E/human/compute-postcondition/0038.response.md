Output State: **`i` is the total number of iterations, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` and the series of terms resulting from the operation `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `y` is `2 ** (i - 1) * (k - g)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 ** (i - 1) * (k - g)` to `y`. Here, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `f` retain their previous values, and `y` is updated based on the formula provided. The value of `g` is the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` and the series of terms resulting from the operation `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, which remains unchanged from its previous state.
