Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more inputs provided via `input()`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final output state will depend on the last set of inputs `n` and `k` provided. 

- If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, then:
  - `i` will be the total number of iterations in the first while loop.
  - `g` will be the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` and the series of terms resulting from the operation `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
  - `f` will be `k - g`.
  - `y` will be calculated as `2 ** (i - 1) * f`.

- If `k <= (n + 1) // 2`, then:
  - `i` will be 0.
  - `y` will be `2 * k - 1`.

The final value of `y` will be printed for each test case, and the process repeats until all inputs are processed. The output state after all iterations will include the final computed value of `y` for each test case.
