Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`d`).
   - `n` is `d`.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `s` is equal to `k + n`.
   - `d` is `n`.
   - `h` is equal to `n - 1`.
   - `p` is 2.
   - `g` is 1.

3. **Determine Which States Need Adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on `p` and `i - 1`.
   - `p` is currently 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.

4. **Check the Current Values**:
   - `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`d`).
   - Since `d` is `n` and `n` is `d`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`d`).
   - `i - 1` would then be the largest integer less than `i`.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `p` (which is 2) must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.
   - This means `i - 1` must be at least 2.
   - Therefore, `i` must be at least 3.

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure `i` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again.
   - Other states like `p`, `n`, `d`, `h`, `k`, and `s` do not affect the loop condition directly and do not need adjustment.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be at least 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is at least 3, `n` is `d`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is `n`, `h` is equal to `n - 1`, `p` is 2, `g` is 1**
