Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1.**

The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `p`. Since `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, and `h` were not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
