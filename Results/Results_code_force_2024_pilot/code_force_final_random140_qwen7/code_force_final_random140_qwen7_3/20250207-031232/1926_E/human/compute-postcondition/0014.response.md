Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is `d + 1` // 2 more than its original value, `d` is an integer input from the user, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `(d + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since `d` is an integer input from the user, `(d + 1) // 2` is a specific value depending on the input of `d`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
