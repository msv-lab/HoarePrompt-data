Output State: **`i` must be greater than 4; `h` is equal to half of its original value minus (half of its original value + 1) // 2; `p` must be less than `i - 2`; `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `h -= (h + 1) // 2` updates the value of `h` by subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from its current value. Since `h` is initially half of its original value, let's denote the original value of `h` as `original_h`. Therefore, `h` is now `original_h / 2 - (original_h / 2 + 1) // 2`. The other variables `i`, `p`, and `g` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
