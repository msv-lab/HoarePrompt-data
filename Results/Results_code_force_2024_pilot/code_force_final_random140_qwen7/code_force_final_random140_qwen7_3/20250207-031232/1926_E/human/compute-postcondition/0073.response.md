Output State: **`i` must be greater than 4; `h` is equal to half of its original value (`(h + 1) // 2`); `p` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is incremented by 1, making `p` greater than its original value by 1. The conditions and values of `i` and `h` remain unchanged from their initial state.
