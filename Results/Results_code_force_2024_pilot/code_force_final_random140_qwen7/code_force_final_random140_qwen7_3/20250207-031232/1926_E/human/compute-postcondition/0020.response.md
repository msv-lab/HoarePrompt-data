Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is `d` + 1, `d` is now `(d + 1) // 2`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 3. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
