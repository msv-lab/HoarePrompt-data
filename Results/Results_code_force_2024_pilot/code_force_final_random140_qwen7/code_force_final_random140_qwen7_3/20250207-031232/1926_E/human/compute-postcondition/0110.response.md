Output State: **`i` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`d`), `n` (which is `d`) must be at least 4, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is `n`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `g += (h + 1) // 2` increments the value of `g` by the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2. Given the initial state, `h` is equal to `n`, which is also `d`. Since `d` is at least 4, let's assume the smallest possible value for `d` to be 4 (as it must be at least 4). Thus, `h` is 4. So, `(h + 1) // 2` becomes `(4 + 1) // 2`, which equals 2. Therefore, `g` is incremented by 2, making `g` equal to 1 (since `g` was initially 0). All other variables remain unchanged.
