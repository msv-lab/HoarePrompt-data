Output State: **`i` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`d`), `n` is `d`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is `n`, `h` is equal to `n - 1`, `p` is 2, `g` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. Initially, `p` was 1, so now `p` is 2. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, and `g`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
