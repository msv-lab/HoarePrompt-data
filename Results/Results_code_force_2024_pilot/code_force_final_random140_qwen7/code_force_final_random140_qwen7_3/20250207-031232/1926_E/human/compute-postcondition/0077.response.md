Output State: **`i` must be greater than 4; `h` is equal to half of its original value minus (half of its original value + 1) // 2; `p` is now `p + 1`; `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: 
- The initial state of `i` being greater than 4 remains unchanged.
- The value of `h` is calculated as half of its original value minus (half of its original value + 1) // 2, which remains the same.
- The variable `p` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`, but since `h` is already determined from its initial calculation, the updated value of `g` reflects this increase.
