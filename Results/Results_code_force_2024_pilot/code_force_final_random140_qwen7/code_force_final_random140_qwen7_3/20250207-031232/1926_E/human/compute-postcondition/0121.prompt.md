Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`, `n` (which is `d`) is 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is 1, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to run as long as `s < k` and `d > 0`. Given the operations inside the loop, `d` is halved each iteration (rounded down), and `s` is incremented by half of `d` plus one each iteration. This process continues until `d` becomes 1, at which point the condition `d > 0` no longer holds true, and the loop terminates. The value of `i` will be the number of iterations it took to reduce `d` from `n` to 1, which is essentially the number of times `n` can be halved, hence `i` equals the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. By the end of the loop, `s` will have accumulated the sum of these increments, resulting in `s = k + n`.
Code of the loop:
while p <= i - 1:
    g += (h + 1) // 2
    h -= (h + 1) // 2
    p += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`d`), `n` is `d`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is `n`, `h` is equal to `n - 1`, `p` is 2, `g` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is at least 3, `n` is `d`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is `n`, `h` is equal to `n - 1 - (n - 1 + 1) // 2`, `p` is 3, `g` is 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` must be at least 4, `n` is `d`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is `n`, `h` is equal to 0, `p` is 4, `g` is 4


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
