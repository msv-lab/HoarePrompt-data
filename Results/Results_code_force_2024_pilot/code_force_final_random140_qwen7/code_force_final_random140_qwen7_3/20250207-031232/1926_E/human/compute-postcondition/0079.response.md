Output State: `i` is equal to 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, `s` is equal to 4, `d` is 0, `h` is equal to 0, `p` is 4, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is 3.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `d` becomes 0, which means the loop condition `d > 0` is no longer satisfied. Since `s` increments by `(d + 1) // 2` and `d` is halved each iteration, it takes exactly 3 iterations for `d` to become 0, starting from an initial non-zero value. Therefore, `i`, which represents the number of iterations, is 4. At this point, `s` equals `i` because `s` increments by 1 with each full cycle of the loop. `h` is reduced to 0 after 3 iterations of halving. `p` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, so it reaches 4 after 3 iterations. `g` is incremented by `(h + 1) // 2` each iteration, starting from 0 and ending at 3 after 3 iterations.
