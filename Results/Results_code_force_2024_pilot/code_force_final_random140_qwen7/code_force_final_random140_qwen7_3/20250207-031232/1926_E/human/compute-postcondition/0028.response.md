Output State: **`i` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `p` is 2, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `g += (h + 1) // 2` increments the value of `g` by `(h + 1) // 2`. Given that `h` is defined as `n - (n + 1) // 2`, the value of `g` becomes `(n + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
