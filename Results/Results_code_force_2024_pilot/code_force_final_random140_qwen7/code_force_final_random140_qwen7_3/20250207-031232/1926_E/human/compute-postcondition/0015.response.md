Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is `d + 1`, `d` is updated to `d // 2`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `d -= (d + 1) // 2` updates the value of `d` by subtracting half of `(d + 1)` (integer division) from `d`. Given that `s` is defined as `d + 1`, `s` remains unchanged because only `d` is modified. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `h`, `p`, `g`) remain unaffected by this operation.
