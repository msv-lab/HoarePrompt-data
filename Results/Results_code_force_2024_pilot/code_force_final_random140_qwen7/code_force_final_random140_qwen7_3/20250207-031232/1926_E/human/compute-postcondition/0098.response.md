Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` (which is `d`) is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 1, `d` is equal to `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their original conditions and values.
