Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is equal to `n`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n` to `h`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `d` remain unchanged, and `h` is now equal to `n`.
