Output State: **`i` is at least 3, `n` is `d`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is `n`, `h` is equal to `n - 1`, `p` is 2, `g` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `g` is incremented by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`. Given that `h` is equal to `n - 1`, the expression `(h + 1) // 2` simplifies to `((n - 1) + 1) // 2`, which further simplifies to `n // 2`. Since `n` is equal to `d`, `g` is incremented by `d // 2`. Initially, `g` is equal to 1, so after the operation, `g` becomes `1 + d // 2`. Given the initial state, `d` is equal to `n`, so `g` becomes `1 + n // 2`, which simplifies to `2` since `n` is at least 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
