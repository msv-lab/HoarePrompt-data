Output State: **`i` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `s` is equal to `i`, `d` is 0, `h` is now `n - 1`, `p` is 2, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. Initially, `p` is 1, so after executing the code, `p` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
