Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `s < k and d > 0`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `s`, `k`, and `d`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is an integer input from the user (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `k` is an integer input from the user (part of the loop condition).
   - `s` is `d + 1` (part of the loop condition).
   - `d` is updated to `d // 2` (part of the loop condition).
   - `h` is `n` (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `p` is 1 (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `g` is 0 (not directly relevant to the loop condition).

4. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `s < k` and `d > 0` must be true.
   - Since `d` is updated to `d // 2` in each iteration, eventually `d` will become 0, making the second condition `d > 0` false.
   - Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `s` must be less than `k` and `d` must be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure `s < k` and `d > 0`.
   - Given that `s` is initially `d + 1`, and `d` is updated to `d // 2`, `s` will be `d // 2 + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - To ensure `d > 0`, `d` must be at least 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `s` and `d`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` must be less than `k`, `d` must be greater than 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**
