Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` (which is `d`) is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `d` is `(d + 1) // 2`, `s` is `k + (d + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `d` is updated to `(d + 1) // 2`. Since `d` was originally greater than 0, it remains greater than 0 after the update. The value of `s` is not directly affected by the change in `d`, so it is still `k + (d + 1) // 2`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
