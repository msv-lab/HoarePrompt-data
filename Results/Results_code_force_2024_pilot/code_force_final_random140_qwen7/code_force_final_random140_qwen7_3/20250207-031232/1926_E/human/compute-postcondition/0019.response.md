Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is `d` + 1, `d` is now `(d + 1) // 2`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**

Explanation: The code `d -= (d + 1) // 2` updates the value of `d` by subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from it. Given that `s` is defined as `d + 1`, `d` is updated to `(d + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
