Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- `k` is an integer input from the user and is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `s` is 0.
- `d` is `n`.
- `h` is `n`.
- `p` is 1.
- `f` is `k - g`, where `g` is 0.

So, `f` simplifies to `k - 0`, which means `f` is equal to `k`.

The expression `2 * k - 1` is evaluated directly using the value of `k`.

Output: **2 * k - 1**
