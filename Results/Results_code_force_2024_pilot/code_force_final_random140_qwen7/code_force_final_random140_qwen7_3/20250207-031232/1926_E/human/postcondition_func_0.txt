The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value \( y \) based on specific conditions involving \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k > \frac{n + 1}{2} \), it computes \( y \) using a series of arithmetic operations. Otherwise, it directly calculates \( y \) as \( 2k - 1 \). The function continues processing until all test cases are exhausted.
