Output State: **`i` is `p`, `S` is the sum of its previous value and the third element from the input split into an integer.**

Explanation: The variable `S` is updated by adding to its current value (which is initially 0 since it's not mentioned otherwise) the integer version of the third element from the input split by whitespace. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `p`.
