Output State: **`T` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is 0, `i` is `p + 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `den` is simplified by dividing both `num` and `den` by their greatest common divisor `g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is not yet calculated**

Explanation: The line `S = 0` sets the variable `S` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
