Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is `ans`, which is calculated as follows:

- `T` is the total number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 50000.
- For each test case, `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers.
- `S` is the sum of the third elements from the input split by spaces for each iteration from `p` to `2p-1`.
- `C` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `num` is calculated as `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, where `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.
- `den` is initially `2 * C * C`, but it is then divided by `g` to simplify.
- `den` is further simplified by taking its modular multiplicative inverse modulo `MOD` (1000000007).
- Finally, `ans` is calculated as `num * den % MOD`.

In summary, `ans` will contain the result of the formula applied to all iterations of the loop for each test case, ensuring that the final answer is computed modulo `1000000007`.
