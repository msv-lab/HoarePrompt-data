Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces added `p` times, `i` is `p + 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `den` is `2 * C * C`**.

Explanation: The code divides `num` by `g`, which is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`. This operation simplifies the fraction represented by `num` and `den`. All other variables remain unchanged.
