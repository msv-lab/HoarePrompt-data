Output State: **`num` is equal to `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `C` is equal to `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `i` is equal to `p`, `S` is the sum of the third elements of the input strings for each iteration of the loop from `p + 1` to `2 * p - 1`, `den` is equal to `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `num` and `den` and assigns it to the variable `g`. The values of `num`, `C`, `i`, `S`, and `den` remain unchanged. The new variable `g` holds the gcd of `num` and `den`.
