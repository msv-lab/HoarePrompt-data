Output State: **`i` is 0, `S` is the sum of all the third elements from the input split into integers for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `num // g`, `den` is `2 * C * C // g`, `den` is now `den // g` and `den` is raised to the power -1 modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `den = pow(den, -1, MOD)` calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` with respect to `MOD` and assigns it back to `den`. This means `den` is now the value such that `den * den % MOD == 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
