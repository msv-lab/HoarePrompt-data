You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, for each of the m lines describing the friendships, a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, p, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        S = 0
        
        for i in range(p):
            S += int(input().split()[2])
        
        C = n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
        
        den = 2 * C * C
        
        g = math.gcd(num, den)
        
        num = num // g
        
        den = den // g
        
        den = pow(den, -1, MOD)
        
        ans = num * den % MOD
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is `ans`, which is calculated as follows:
    #
    #- `T` is the total number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 50000.
    #- For each test case, `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers.
    #- `S` is the sum of the third elements from the input split by spaces for each iteration from `p` to `2p-1`.
    #- `C` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
    #- `num` is calculated as `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, where `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.
    #- `den` is initially `2 * C * C`, but it is then divided by `g` to simplify.
    #- `den` is further simplified by taking its modular multiplicative inverse modulo `MOD` (1000000007).
    #- Finally, `ans` is calculated as `num * den % MOD`.
    #
    #In summary, `ans` will contain the result of the formula applied to all iterations of the loop for each test case, ensuring that the final answer is computed modulo `1000000007`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t, followed by n, m, and k, which are integers with specific constraints. Additionally, it processes m lines of data for each test case, each containing integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. The function does not return a value but processes the input data according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
