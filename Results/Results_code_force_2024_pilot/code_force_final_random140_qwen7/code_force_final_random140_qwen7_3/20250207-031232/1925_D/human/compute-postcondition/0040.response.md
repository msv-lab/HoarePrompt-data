Output State: **`ans` is equal to `num * den % MOD`, `g` is equal to `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `i` is equal to `p`, `S` is the sum of the third elements of the input strings for each iteration of the loop from `p + 1` to `2 * p - 1`, `den` is equal to the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `ans` as `num * den % MOD`. The values of `num`, `g`, `i`, `S`, and `den` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes these variables with their respective initial values and the new value of `ans` which is the result of the calculation.
