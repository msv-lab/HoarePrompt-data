Output State: **`i` is `0`, `S` is the sum of all the third elements from the input split into integers for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is set to `0` after the loop completes its iterations. The variable `S` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. The variable `C` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is a new value derived from the variable `n`. The initial state of `i` being `0` and `S` being the sum of all the third elements from the input split into integers for each of the `p` iterations of the loop is preserved.
