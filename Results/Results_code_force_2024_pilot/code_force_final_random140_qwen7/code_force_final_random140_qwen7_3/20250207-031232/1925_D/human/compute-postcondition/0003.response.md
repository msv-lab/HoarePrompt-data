Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, p, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `p`, and `k`. The initial condition that `T` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
