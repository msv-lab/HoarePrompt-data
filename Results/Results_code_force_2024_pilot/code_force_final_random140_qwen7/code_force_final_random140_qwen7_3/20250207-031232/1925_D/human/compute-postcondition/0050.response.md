Output State: **`i` is `p`, `S` is the sum of its previous value and twice the third element from the input split into an integer**.

Explanation: The variable `S` is updated by adding the integer value of the third element from the input split. Since the initial state mentions that `S` is the sum of its previous value and the third element from the input split into an integer plus the third element from the input split into an integer, this means `S` was initially `S + int(input().split()[2]) + int(input().split()[2])`. After running the code `S += int(input().split()[2])`, `S` is now `S + int(input().split()[2])`, which simplifies to the sum of its previous value and twice the third element from the input split into an integer. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code.
