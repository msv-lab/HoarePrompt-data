Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 50000; `MOD` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), the same constraint applies to `T`. The variable `MOD` remains unchanged with its value set to 1000000007.
