Output State: **`ans` is equal to `num * den % MOD`, `g` is equal to `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `i` is equal to `p`, `S` is the sum of the third elements of the input strings for each iteration of the loop from `p + 1` to `2 * p - 1`, `den` is equal to the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `n`, `p`, and `k` are assigned the values of `map(int, input().split())`.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `p`, and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `g`, `i`, `S`, or `den`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new values of `n`, `p`, and `k` are assigned to the respective variables.
