Output State: **`num` is equal to `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `C` is equal to `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `i` is equal to `p`, `S` is the sum of the third elements of the input strings for each iteration of the loop from `p + 1` to `2 * p - 1`, `den` is equal to `2 * C * C`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * C * C` to the variable `den`. This calculation does not affect the values of `num`, `C`, `i`, or `S`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new value of `den` is calculated based on the current value of `C`, which itself is defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
