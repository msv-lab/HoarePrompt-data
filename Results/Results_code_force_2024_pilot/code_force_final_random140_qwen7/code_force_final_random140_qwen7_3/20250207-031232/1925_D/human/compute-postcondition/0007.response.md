The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `p`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `T` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `p`. Since `i` starts from 0, if it was `i = p - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` would need to be incremented to `i = p` for the next iteration.

Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `i = p - 1 + 1 = p` for the next iteration.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces, `i` is `p`**
