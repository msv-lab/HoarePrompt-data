Output State: **`ans` is equal to `num * den % MOD`, `g` is equal to `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `i` is equal to `p`, `S` is 0, `den` is equal to the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `n`, `p`, and `k` are assigned the values of `map(int, input().split())`.**

Explanation: The line `S = 0` sets the variable `S` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
