Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is equal to `num * den % MOD`
- `g` is equal to `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `i` is equal to `p`
- `S` is the sum of the third elements of the input strings for each iteration of the loop from `p + 1` to `2 * p - 1`
- `den` is equal to the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is computed as `num * den % MOD`.

Since the exact values of `num`, `den`, and `MOD` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is the result of the expression `num * den % MOD`.

Output: **ans (where ans is num * den % MOD)**
