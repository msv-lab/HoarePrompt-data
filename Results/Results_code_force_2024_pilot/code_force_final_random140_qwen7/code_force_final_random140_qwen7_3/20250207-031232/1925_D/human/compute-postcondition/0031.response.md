Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `p`, `S` will be the sum of the third elements from the input strings for each iteration from `0` to `p-1`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will no longer be less than `p` because it will have reached `p`. The variable `S` will hold the cumulative sum of the third elements from the input strings provided during each iteration of the loop.
