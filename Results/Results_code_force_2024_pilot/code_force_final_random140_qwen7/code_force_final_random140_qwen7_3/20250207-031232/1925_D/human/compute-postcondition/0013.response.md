Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces added `p` times, `i` is `p + 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `C` using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This formula computes the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items without repetition and without order. The values of `T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the newly calculated value of `C`.
