Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is typically an underscore when the loop variable is not used within the loop body.
   - The loop runs `T` times, where `T` is the input integer.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `T` is greater than 0.
   - Since `T` is given as an input integer with the constraint \(1 \leq T \leq 50000\), the loop will always execute if `T` is within this range.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `T`, because the loop's condition depends on `T`.
   - For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `T` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
