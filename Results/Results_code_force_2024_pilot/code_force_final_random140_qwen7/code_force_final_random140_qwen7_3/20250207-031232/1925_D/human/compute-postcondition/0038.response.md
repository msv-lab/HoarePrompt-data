Output State: **`num` is equal to `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `g` is equal to `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `i` is equal to `p`, `S` is the sum of the third elements of the input strings for each iteration of the loop from `p + 1` to `2 * p - 1`, `den` is equal to `2 * C * C // g`.**

Explanation: The code divides `den` by `g`, which is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`. This operation updates the value of `den` to `2 * C * C // g`. All other variables remain unchanged.
