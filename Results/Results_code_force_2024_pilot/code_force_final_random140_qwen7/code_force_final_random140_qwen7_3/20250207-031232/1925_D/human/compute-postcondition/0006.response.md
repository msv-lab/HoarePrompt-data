Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `S += int(input().split()[2])` takes an input, splits it into a list of strings, and adds the integer value of the third element (index 2) to `S`. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
