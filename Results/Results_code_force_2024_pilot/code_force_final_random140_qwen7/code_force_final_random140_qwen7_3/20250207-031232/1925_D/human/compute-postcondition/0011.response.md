Output State: `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements from each input split by spaces for all iterations, `i` is `2p`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `T` remains greater than 0, `n` and `k` remain as the initial input integers, `p` must still be greater than or equal to 1, `S` is the cumulative sum of the third elements from the input split by spaces for each iteration of the loop (which runs from `i=0` to `i=p-1`), and `i` will be set to `2p` after the loop completes.
