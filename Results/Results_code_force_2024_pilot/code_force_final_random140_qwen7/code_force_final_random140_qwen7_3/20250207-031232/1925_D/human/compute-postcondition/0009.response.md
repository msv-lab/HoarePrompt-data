Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `p`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `T` must be greater than 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `p` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces plus an input integer
   - `i` is `p`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < p`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `p` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `p`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `p`. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become `p + 1`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `T` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
   - `p` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
   - `k` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
   - `S` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
   - `i` is updated to `p + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces plus an input integer, `i` is `p + 1`**
