Output State: **`num` is equal to `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `C` is equal to `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `i` is equal to `p`, and `S` is the sum of the third elements of the input strings for each iteration of the loop from `p + 1` to `2 * p - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num` based on the given formula involving `p`, `k`, `C`, and `S`. The values of `C`, `i`, and `S` remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in the calculation of `num`.
