Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces plus 2 times the input integer, `i` is `p + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `S += int(input().split()[2])` takes the third element from the input split by spaces and converts it to an integer, then adds it to the current value of `S`. Since the third element from the input was already part of the calculation for `S` (as given in the initial state), the new value of `S` is the previous value of `S` plus the integer value of the third element from the input again. All other variables remain unchanged.
