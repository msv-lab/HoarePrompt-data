Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `p`, `S` will be the sum of the third elements of the input strings for each iteration of the loop from `p + 1` to `2*p - 1`.

In more detail, since the loop runs for `p` iterations and starts with `i = p + 1`, it will increment `i` until it reaches `2*p`. During each iteration, `S` is updated by adding the integer value of the third element from the input string split by spaces. Therefore, `S` will contain the cumulative sum of these third elements over all iterations.
