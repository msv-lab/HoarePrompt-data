The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes integers \( n \), \( p \), and \( k \). It also processes additional lines of data for each test case, each containing integers \( a_i \), \( b_i \), and \( f_i \). For each test case, the function calculates a value based on the given inputs and arithmetic operations, including the computation of sums, gcd, and modular arithmetic. The final result, \( ans \), is printed for each test case, representing the outcome of the specified formula, adjusted for the given constraints and modulo \( 1000000007 \).
