### Reasoning:

The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \( a \), which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).

To maximize this sum, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, thereby maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.

Let's analyze the given code:

1. **Loop through each test case**: The outer loop iterates over each test case.
2. **Read the size of the array `n`**: This is the length of the array for the current test case.
3. **Sort the array**: The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. **Calculate the beauty of the array**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, starting from the second element.

Here's the key part of the code:
```python
ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
```

- The array `ar` is sorted.
- The sum of the differences between consecutive elements is computed using a list comprehension and the `sum` function.

Given that sorting the array ensures the maximum possible beauty, the provided code correctly implements the solution.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct because it sorts the array and calculates the beauty as required.

### Response:

Correctness: **True**
