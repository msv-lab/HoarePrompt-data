### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. However, let's break down the logic more thoroughly to ensure there are no hidden issues.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `ar`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `ar` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))`.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are at the beginning and the largest elements are at the end.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - Specifically, the program computes `sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)])`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array is indeed a good strategy to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the smallest elements will be paired with the next smallest elements, and so on.

2. **Summing Differences:**
   - The expression `ar[i] - ar[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` will yield the maximum possible values for these differences. This is because the sorted array ensures that the differences are as large as possible for the given constraints.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints.
   - It correctly calculates the maximum beauty by ensuring the array is sorted before computing the differences.

However, there is one subtle issue to consider. The original assessment assumes that sorting the array will always yield the maximum beauty. Let's consider an example to verify this:

#### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4
  3 4 3 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  1
  ```

- **Program Output:**
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.
  - The differences are `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.

The program's output matches the expected output. Therefore, the sorting approach is correct for this specific example.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the beauty is maximized for any given array.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**
