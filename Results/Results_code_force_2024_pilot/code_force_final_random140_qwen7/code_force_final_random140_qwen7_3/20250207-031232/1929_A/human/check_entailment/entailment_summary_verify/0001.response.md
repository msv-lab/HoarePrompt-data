### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements. However, let's break down the logic and verify if this approach indeed maximizes the beauty of the array.

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This means the smallest elements are placed at the beginning, and the largest elements are placed at the end.

2. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: `sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)])`.

### Verification:

- **Maximizing Differences:**
  - When the array is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the differences are `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`. If the array is `[3, 2, 1]`, the differences are `(2-3) + (1-2) = -2`, which is not the maximum possible value.
  
- **General Case:**
  - Consider an array `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` sorted as `[b_1, b_2, ..., b_n]`. The beauty is `sum([b_i - b_{i-1} for i in range(1, n)])`. Since the array is sorted, the differences `b_i - b_{i-1}` are maximized for the given constraints.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints correctly. For example:
    - For `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]` and the beauty is `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`.
    - For `[69, 69, 69]`, sorting gives `[69, 69, 69]` and the beauty is `0` since all elements are the same.
    - For `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` and the beauty is `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which indeed maximizes the beauty of the array. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
