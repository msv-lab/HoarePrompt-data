Reasoning:

The given program aims to calculate the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The program correctly sorts the array before calculating these differences, which ensures that the differences are maximized.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Input and Sorting**: For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array elements. It then sorts the array in ascending order.
3. **Beauty Calculation**: After sorting, the program calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements using the formula `(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
4. **Output**: The calculated beauty is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the maximum possible beauty of the array by ensuring the differences between consecutive elements are maximized through sorting.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
