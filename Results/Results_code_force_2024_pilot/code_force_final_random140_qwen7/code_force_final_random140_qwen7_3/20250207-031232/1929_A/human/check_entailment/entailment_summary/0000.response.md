Reasoning:
The given program aims to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

The program's approach is to sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements. This approach is correct because sorting the array ensures that the largest possible differences are between the smallest and largest elements, which maximizes the overall sum of differences.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why this works:
1. **Sorting**: Sorting the array arranges the elements in non-decreasing order.
2. **Sum of Differences**: By calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, we ensure that the largest possible differences are utilized.

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: 
  - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Beauty: \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2\)

- **Example 2**: 
  - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0\)

- **Example 3**: 
  - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Beauty: \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\)

- **Example 4**: 
  - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Beauty: \((3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)

- **Example 5**: 
  - Input: `[2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - Beauty: \((2 - 1) = 1\)

The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty for each test case by sorting the array and computing the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
