Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements. However, sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array as defined in the problem. The goal is to maximize the expression \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

To achieve the maximum beauty, we should place the largest element at the beginning and the smallest at the end of the array after sorting. This way, the difference between the first and second elements will be maximized, and the difference between the last two elements will also be maximized, while the intermediate differences are minimized.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar = sorted(ar)
        # Calculate the maximum beauty by placing the smallest element at the start and the largest at the end
        max_beauty = ar[-1] - ar[0]
        # Sum up the differences between consecutive elements
        max_beauty += sum(ar[i+1] - ar[i] for i in range(n-1))
        print(max_beauty)

func()
```

This corrected solution ensures that the maximum possible beauty of the array is calculated correctly.
