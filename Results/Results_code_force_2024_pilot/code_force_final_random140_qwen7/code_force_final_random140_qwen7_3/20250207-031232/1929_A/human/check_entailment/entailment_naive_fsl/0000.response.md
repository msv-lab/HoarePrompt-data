Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly rearrange the array to maximize the beauty as described in the problem statement. The program simply sorts the array and calculates the difference between consecutive elements, which does not necessarily yield the maximum possible beauty. For instance, consider the input:

```
4
10 5 3 8
```

The sorted array would be `[3, 5, 8, 10]`, and the calculated beauty would be `(5-3) + (8-5) + (10-8) = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7`. However, the optimal arrangement could be `[10, 3, 5, 8]`, which gives a beauty of `(3-10) + (5-3) + (8-5) = -7 + 2 + 3 = -2`.

To maximize the beauty, the largest element should be placed at the beginning, followed by the smallest element, then the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the positive differences are maximized and negative differences minimized. The provided solution does not account for this optimal arrangement.
