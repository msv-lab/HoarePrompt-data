The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it sorts the list of integers, calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
