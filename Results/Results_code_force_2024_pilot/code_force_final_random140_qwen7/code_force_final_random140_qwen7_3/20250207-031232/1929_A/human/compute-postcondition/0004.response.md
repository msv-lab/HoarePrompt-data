Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` expression. This means that the loop will iterate based on the value entered as input.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the input integer (let's call it `input_value`) is valid. The loop will stop when the input integer is no longer within the acceptable range or does not meet some other condition (which is not specified here).

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will prompt for another input value.
   - The variable `input_value` will be set to the new input.
   - The variable `t` will be updated to reflect the new input value.
   - The variables `n` and `ar` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they stay the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` will be the new input value.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ar` remains the same.

Since the loop is driven by the input value, we need to update `t` to the new input value. The values of `n` and `ar` do not change based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is the new input value, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user**.
