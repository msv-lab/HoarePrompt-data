Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state given is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - This means that the input value (which is used as the argument to `range`) could be any integer between 1 and 500.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the input value must be a non-negative integer.
   - Since `t` is already constrained to be between 1 and 500, it ensures that the input value will be valid for the loop to execute.

4. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - We need to ensure that the input value (which is read from `input()` inside the loop) is a valid integer within the expected range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value that will be read from `input()`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the input value must be a non-negative integer**.
