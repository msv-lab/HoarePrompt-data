Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is the new input value.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.
   - `n` is assigned the value of the new input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers sorted based on the input values.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must provide a positive integer as the number of iterations.
   - Since `_` is a placeholder in the loop, it doesn't affect the state directly. However, the value of `int(input())` will determine how many times the loop runs.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())`, which will be the new number of iterations for the loop.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `ar`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is the new input value, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, and `int(input())` must be a positive integer.**
