Output State: **`t` is the new input value, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, and `n` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function. This input replaces the previous value of `n`, which was described as an input integer. The other variables (`t` and `ar`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
