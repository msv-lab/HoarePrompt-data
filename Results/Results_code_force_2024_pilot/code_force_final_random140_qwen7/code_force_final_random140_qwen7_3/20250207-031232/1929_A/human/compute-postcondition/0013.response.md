Output State: The value of `t` will be the input value for the last iteration of the loop, `n` will be the input integer for the last iteration, and `ar` will be a sorted list of integers entered by the user for the last iteration.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will hold the value of the final test case's `t`, `n` will hold the value of the final test case's `n`, and `ar` will be the sorted list of integers corresponding to the final test case's input.
