To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is the new input value (not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is the new input integer (the length of the list `ar`).
   - `ar` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, converted from a space-separated input.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
   ```

   This line of code calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:
   - The expression inside the `sum` function is a list comprehension that iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive).
   - For each index `i` in this range, it computes the difference `ar[i] - ar[i - 1]`.
   - These differences are then summed up.

4. **Output Description**:
   - Since `ar` is a sorted list of integers, the differences `ar[i] - ar[i - 1]` represent the increments between consecutive elements in the list.
   - The `sum` function adds these increments together.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the increments between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`.

Output: **sum of the increments between consecutive elements in the sorted list ar**
