Output State: **`t` is the new input value, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user converted from a space-separated input.**

Explanation: The code takes a space-separated list of integers as input, converts each element to an integer, sorts the list, and assigns it to `ar`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
