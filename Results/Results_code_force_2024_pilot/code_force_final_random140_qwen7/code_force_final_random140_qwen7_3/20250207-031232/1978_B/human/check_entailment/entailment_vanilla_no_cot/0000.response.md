Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The initial profit is set to \( n \times a \), which is the total profit if no buns are sold at the modified price.
   - If \( a \geq b \), then there is no benefit in changing the price, so the profit remains \( n \times a \).
   - If \( a < b \), the program calculates the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price. The value of \( k \) is determined by \( k = b - a \) and constrained by \( k \leq n - 1 \).
   - The profit calculation takes into account the sum of an arithmetic series for the modified prices and adjusts the total profit accordingly.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program accurately computes the maximum profit for each test case, making the correctness evaluation **True**.
