Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates the initial profit assuming all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
4. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program prints the initial profit without any modifications, which is correct according to the problem statement.
5. If `a` is less than `b`, the program calculates the optimal `k` value to maximize profit. The formula used to calculate the profit when `a < b` is correct:
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is `k * b + (k-1) * b + ... + (b - k + 1)`.
   - This sum can be simplified to `(b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.
6. The program then prints the final profit, which is the initial profit plus the additional profit from the first `k` buns.
7. The loop correctly decrements `t` after processing each test case, ensuring that all test cases are processed.

Given the above analysis, the program logic matches the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
