### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the given problem description and function summary.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

2. **Initial Profit Calculation:**
   - The initial profit is set to \( n \times a \).
   - This is correct because if no buns are sold at the modified price, the profit is simply the usual price multiplied by the number of buns.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if \( a \geq b \):
     - If true, it prints the initial profit \( n \times a \).
     - If false, it proceeds to calculate the modified profit.

4. **Optimal \( k \) Calculation:**
   - The value of \( k \) is calculated as \( \min(n - 1, b - a) \).
     - This ensures that \( k \) is within the valid range and does not exceed \( n - 1 \).
   - This is correct because \( k \) represents the number of buns sold at the modified price, and the modified price is \( b - i + 1 \) for the \( i \)-th bun.

5. **Modified Profit Calculation:**
   - The modified profit is updated by adding the sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns and subtracting the sum of the arithmetic series from 1 to \( k \).
     - The sum of the modified prices is \( (b - 1) + (b - 2) + \ldots + (b - k + 1) \), which simplifies to \( b \times k - \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \).
     - The subtraction of \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \) accounts for the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( a \geq b \) correctly by printing the initial profit without any further calculations.
   - The program also handles the case where \( k = 0 \) (i.e., no buns are sold at the modified price) correctly by setting \( k \) to 0.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and function summary. The provided examples also match the expected outcomes.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns according to the specified rules.
