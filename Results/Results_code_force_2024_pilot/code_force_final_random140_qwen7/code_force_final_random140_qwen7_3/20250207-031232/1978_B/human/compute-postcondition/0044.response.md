Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers with the third element being `b`, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is either `n * a` if `a >= b`, or `n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2` if `a < b`, and `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)` if `a < b`.**

Explanation: The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. All other variables (`x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `profit`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
