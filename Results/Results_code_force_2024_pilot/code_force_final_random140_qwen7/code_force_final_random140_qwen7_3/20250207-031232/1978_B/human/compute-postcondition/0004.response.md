Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the second element of the list `x` to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
