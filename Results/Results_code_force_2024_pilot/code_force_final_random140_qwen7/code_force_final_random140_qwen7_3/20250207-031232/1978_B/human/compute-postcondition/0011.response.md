Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is `n * a`, `k` is `b - a`, and `a` is less than `b`**.

The code `k = b - a` assigns the value of `b - a` to the variable `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `k` is specifically `b - a` because `a` is less than `b`.
