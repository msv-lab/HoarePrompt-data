Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers where the second element is stored in `a`, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is `n * a`**.

This means that the value of `profit` is calculated as the product of `n` (the first element of the list `x`) and `a` (the second element of the list `x`). The other variables retain their initial conditions.
