Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, n, and a, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and for each test case, n and a are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns a value based on the relationship between n and a for each test case.**

Given the constraints, the function seems to process multiple test cases (determined by t), and for each test case, it compares n and a, returning a specific value based on their relationship. However, without the exact logic for the return value, we can only describe the input parameters and the structure of the function's operation.
