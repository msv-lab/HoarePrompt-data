Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `n` is the first element of the list `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `x` to the variable `n`. The values of `t` and the list `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
