Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores them in a list named `x`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
