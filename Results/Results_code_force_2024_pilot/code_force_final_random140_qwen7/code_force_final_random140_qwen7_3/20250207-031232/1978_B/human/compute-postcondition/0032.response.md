Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element into an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `x`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still needs to be greater than 0.
