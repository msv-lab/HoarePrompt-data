You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program: 
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))



- Annotated Code: 
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer n, where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer n within the range 1 to 200,000 (inclusive) and returns the sum of its digits.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - The task is to calculate the sum of the numbers after replacing each integer from 1 to \( n \) with the sum of its digits.
   - The provided program does not actually perform this calculation for any input \( n \). Instead, it calls `func_1` for the numbers 0 through 12 and sums the results.

2. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `soma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (inclusive), calling `func_1(i)` for each value of `i` in this range.
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer \( n \) and returns the sum of its digits.
   - Finally, it prints the accumulated sum `soma`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number \( n \).
   - This part of the code is correct and works as intended.

4. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the numbers 0 through 12, but the problem requires iterating over numbers from 1 to \( n \) for each test case.
   - Since the loop is hardcoded to iterate from 0 to 12, it will always compute the sum of digit sums for these specific numbers, which is not what the problem requires.

5. **Test Cases:**
   - Given the input format and the expected output, the program will produce incorrect results for any test case where \( n > 12 \).

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the required functionality because it only processes the numbers 0 through 12 instead of processing the numbers from 1 to \( n \) for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
