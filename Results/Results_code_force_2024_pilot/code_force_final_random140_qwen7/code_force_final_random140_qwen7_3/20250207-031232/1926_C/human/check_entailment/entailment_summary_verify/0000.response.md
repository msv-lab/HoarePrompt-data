### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program:

1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop `for i in range(13)` iterates over the numbers from 0 to 12. This means the function `func_1` is called 13 times, once for each number in this range. However, the problem requires summing the digits of numbers from 1 to \(n\) for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number. This part of the implementation is correct.

3. **Summation Logic**: The summation logic in the main program is incorrect because it sums the digits of numbers from 0 to 12, not from 1 to \(n\).

Given the problem description and the function summary, the program should iterate from 1 to \(n\) for each test case and compute the sum of the digits for each number in that range. The current implementation does not achieve this.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the required logic of summing the digits of numbers from 1 to \(n\) for each test case.
