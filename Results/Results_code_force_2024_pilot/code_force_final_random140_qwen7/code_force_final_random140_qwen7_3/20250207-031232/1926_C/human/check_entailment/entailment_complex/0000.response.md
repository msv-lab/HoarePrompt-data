Reasoning:
The provided code snippet does not correctly solve the problem described. The main issue lies in the range of the loop and the function being called. The problem requires processing multiple test cases, but the current implementation only processes a fixed set of numbers (from 1 to 12) and does not handle the input `t` (the number of test cases) or individual `n` values for each test case.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop `for i in range(13)` iterates over the numbers from 0 to 12, which is not related to the problem's requirement to process numbers up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1(i)` is called for each number in the range 0 to 12, which is not relevant to the problem. The function itself is defined correctly to compute the sum of the digits of a number.

3. **Lack of Input Handling**: The program does not read the input values for `t` and `n` as specified in the problem statement. It also does not accumulate the results for each test case.

Given these issues, the provided code snippet is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
