Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated in the problem description.
- The program initializes `soma` to 0 and then adds the result of `func_1(i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to 12. This means it calculates the sum of the digits for numbers from 0 to 12, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.
- The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits for numbers from 1 to `n` for multiple test cases, but the provided code does not handle multiple test cases or any value of `n` greater than 12.
- The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number, but it is not used in the context intended by the problem.

Given the above points, the program does not match the problem requirements and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
