Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The program initializes `soma` to 0 and then adds the result of `func_1(i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to 12. This means it is calculating the sum of the digits for the numbers 0 through 12, which is irrelevant to the problem statement where the numbers from 1 to `n` should be considered.

Furthermore, the input handling and output generation parts of the program are missing. The program should read the number of test cases and process each test case individually, but the current implementation does not do so.

Given the above points, the program does not meet the problem's requirements and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
