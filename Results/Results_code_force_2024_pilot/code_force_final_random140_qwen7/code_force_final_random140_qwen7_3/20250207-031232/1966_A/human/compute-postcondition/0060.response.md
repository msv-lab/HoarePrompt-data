Postcondition: `ans` is `k - 1`, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `h` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second element of the list `a` and the value is either incremented by 1 (making it at least `k + 1`) or set to 1, and the current value of `h[i]` is at least `k`.
