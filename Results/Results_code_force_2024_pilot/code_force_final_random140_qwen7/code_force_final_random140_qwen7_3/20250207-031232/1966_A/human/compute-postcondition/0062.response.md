Postcondition: **`ans` is `k - 1`, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `h` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second element of the list `a` and the value is at least `k + 1`, and the current value of `h[i]` is at least `k`**.

This postcondition summarizes that if the condition `h[i] >= k` is true, then `ans` remains `k - 1`, and the value of `h[i]` is incremented to at least `k + 1`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change from the if part.
