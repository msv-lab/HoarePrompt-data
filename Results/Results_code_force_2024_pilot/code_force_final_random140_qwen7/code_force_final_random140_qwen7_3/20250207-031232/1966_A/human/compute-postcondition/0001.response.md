Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer.
