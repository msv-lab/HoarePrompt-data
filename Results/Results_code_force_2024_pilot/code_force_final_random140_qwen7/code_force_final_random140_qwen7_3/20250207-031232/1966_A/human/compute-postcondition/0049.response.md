Postcondition: `ans` is `n`, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `h` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element of the list `a` and the value is either incremented by 1 or set to 1, depending on whether the first element of `a` was already in `h` before the execution of the if-else block, and `i` is the first element of the list `a`.
