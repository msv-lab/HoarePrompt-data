Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements (since it lost one element), `i` is the second element in the list `a`, `ams` is either `k - 1` if `h[i]` was incremented by 1 and was already greater than or equal to `k`, or remains unchanged if `h[i]` was set to 1 or was already less than `k`.
