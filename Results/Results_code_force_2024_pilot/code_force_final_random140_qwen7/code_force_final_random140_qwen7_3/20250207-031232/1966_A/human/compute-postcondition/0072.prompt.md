Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is `n`, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `h` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is `k - 1`, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `h` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element of the list `a` and the value is incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether the first element of the list `a` was already in the dictionary `h` before the if-else block executes, and the current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is `k - 1`, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `h` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second element of the list `a` and the value is at least `k + 1`, and the current value of `h[i]` is at least `k`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is `k - 1`, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with one less element, and `h` is a dictionary with the key being the second element of the list `a`. If the value of the key in the dictionary is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of the key in the dictionary is set to `k + 2`. Otherwise, the value of the key in the dictionary is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
