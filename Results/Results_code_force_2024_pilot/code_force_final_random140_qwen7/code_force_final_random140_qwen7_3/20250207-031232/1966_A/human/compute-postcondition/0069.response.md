Postcondition: `ans` is `k - 1`, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with one less element, and `h` is a dictionary with the key being the second element of the list `a`. If the value of the key in the dictionary is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of the key in the dictionary is set to `k + 2`. Otherwise, the value of the key in the dictionary is set to 1.
