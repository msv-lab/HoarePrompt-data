Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is assigned the value 1, and `h[i]` is now 1**.

Explanation: The code `h[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the index `i` in the list `h`. Since `i` is not in the set `h`, it implies that `i` is an index for the list `h`. After executing this line, the value at index `i` in `h` is updated to 1. The list `a` and the variable `i` itself remain unchanged from their initial conditions, but now `h[i]` is known to be 1.
