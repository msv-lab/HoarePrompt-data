Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the first input value, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `h` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `h`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
