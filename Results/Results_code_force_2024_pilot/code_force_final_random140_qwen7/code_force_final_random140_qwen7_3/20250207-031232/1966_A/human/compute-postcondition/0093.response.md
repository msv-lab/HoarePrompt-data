Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - **Variable `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one of the elements from the list `a`.
   - **List `a`:** Since the loop is iterating over `a`, the list `a` itself does not change within the loop. However, the state of `i` changes with each iteration.

4. **Postconditions to Consider:**
   - The postcondition ensures that if `i` is found in `h`, the value of `h[i]` is increased by 1.
   - If `i` is not initially in `h`, it is added to `h` with the value 1.
   - If the current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is set to `k - 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop is about to start the next iteration, `i` will be the next element from the list `a`.
   - The list `a` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the above points, let's formulate the new state:

- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be the next element from the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `i` is the next element from the list `a`**.
