Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the first input value, `k` is an integer representing the second input value**.

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. The initial state's condition that the input value must be a positive integer representing the number of additional iterations for the loop is now satisfied by `n` and `k`. The output state includes these new assignments while noting that the precondition of the input being positive integers still holds.
