Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements (since it lost one element), `i` is the second element in the list `a`. If `i` is in `h`, then `h[i]` is incremented by 1, and if `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ams` is set to `k - 1`. If `i` is not in `h`, then `h[i]` is set to 1, and `ams` remains unchanged.
