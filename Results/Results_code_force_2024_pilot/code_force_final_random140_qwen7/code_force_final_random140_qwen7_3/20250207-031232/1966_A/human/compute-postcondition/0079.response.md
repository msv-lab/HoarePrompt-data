Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in a:`. Here, the objects involved are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is the variable used to iterate over the elements of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states based on the above conditions**:
   - Since `i` is used to iterate over the elements of `a`, it will take on the values of the elements in `a` during each iteration. However, before the loop starts, we only need to ensure that `a` contains at least one element.
   - The value of `i` itself is not specified in the initial state, but we know that if the loop executes, `i` will take on the values from the list `a`.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - The initial state of `ans` and `n` does not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - The initial state of `h` (an empty dictionary) is fine as it does not impact the loop execution.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the list `a` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
