Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, extracting the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Position Check**: The program checks if Bob's initial position is not higher than Alice's. If it is, the game is a draw (`print('draw')`).

3. **Odd Distance Check**: If the vertical distance between the two chips is odd, Alice can always force a win. This is because Alice can always move her chip to match Bob's vertical position, eventually leading to a win. The program correctly handles this scenario by checking if the horizontal distance allows Alice to reach Bob's position.

4. **Even Distance Check**: If the vertical distance is even, Bob can always force a draw or a win. The program correctly handles this scenario by checking if the horizontal distance and the vertical distance allow Bob to avoid being captured by Alice.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board, which would result in a draw.

6. **Output**: The program outputs the correct result for each test case based on the logic implemented.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
