### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the game rules and outcomes based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions (`h`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`).

2. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if Bob's initial position is lower than Alice's (`x2 <= x1`). If so, it immediately prints "Draw" and returns, which is correct because Bob cannot win if he starts below Alice.

3. **Odd Distance Check**:
   - If the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is odd (`(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`), the program checks if Alice and Bob are on the same column (`y1 == y2`).
     - If yes, Alice wins ("Alice").
     - If no, the program adjusts the positions of Alice and Bob to bring them closer vertically and checks again if they are on the same column.
     - If they are still not on the same column, the program calculates the necessary moves to bring them to the same column and checks if Alice can force a win.

4. **Even Distance Check**:
   - If the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is even, similar logic is applied but with different adjustments.
     - If Alice and Bob are on the same column, Bob wins ("Bob").
     - If not, the program adjusts the positions of Alice and Bob to bring them closer vertically and checks if Bob can force a win.

5. **Winning Conditions**:
   - The program correctly identifies winning conditions based on the positions and movements of Alice and Bob.
   - It handles edge cases where further moves would result in a draw or a win for either player.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where further moves would result in a draw or a win for either player.
   - It ensures that the moves stay within the boundaries of the board.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the game logic and outcomes according to the problem description. It handles all the necessary conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
