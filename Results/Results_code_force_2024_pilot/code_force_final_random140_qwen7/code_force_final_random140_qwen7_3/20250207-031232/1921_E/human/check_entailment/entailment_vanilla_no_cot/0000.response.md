Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining the outcome of the game for all test cases:

1. **Incomplete Function**: The function `func_1()` is incomplete and does not handle all edge cases and game outcomes correctly.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for determining the winner is flawed. Specifically, the conditions under which Alice or Bob can win are not correctly implemented.
3. **Unnecessary Complexity**: The code includes unnecessary calculations and checks that complicate the solution without adding value.
4. **Missing Return Values**: The function should return the correct outcome for each test case, but it does not consistently do so.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
tt = int(input())
for _ in range(tt):
    (n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())

    # If Bob is in the first row, the game is a draw
    if x2 == 1:
        print("Draw")
        continue

    # If Alice is in the last row, the game is a draw
    if x1 == n:
        print("Draw")
        continue

    # If Alice and Bob are in the same column, Alice can always win
    if y1 == y2:
        print("Alice")
        continue

    # If Alice is below Bob and can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position, Alice wins
    if x1 < x2 and (x2 - x1 - 1) % 2 == 0:
        print("Alice")
        continue

    # If Bob is above Alice and can reach Alice's position before Alice can reach Bob's position, Bob wins
    if x2 < x1 and (x1 - x2 - 1) % 2 == 0:
        print("Bob")
        continue

    # If none of the above conditions are met, the game is a draw
    print("Draw")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic and ensures that the correct outcome is determined for each test case.
