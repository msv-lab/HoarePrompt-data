Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw'. Based on the conditions of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` being either both even or both odd, the `answers` list is modified as follows:
- If `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, 'Bob' is appended to the `answers` list.
- If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, the `answers` list is changed to contain 'Bob', 'Alice', and 'Draw', with 'Alice' being the last element.
- If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not 1, and the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, the `answers` list remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to the `answers` list if the first condition is met, or 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list if the second condition is met.**
