Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw'**

Explanation: The code `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `clues`. The initial values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `answers` remain unchanged. The precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 is still valid, and `i` remains 3. The list `clues` now contains integers, and `answers` remains a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw'.
