Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Draw', and 'Alice'**.

The code appends 'Alice' to the `answers` list, which initially contained 'Bob', 'Alice', and 'Draw'. Therefore, the updated `answers` list now includes 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Draw', and 'Alice'. The other variables remain unchanged.
