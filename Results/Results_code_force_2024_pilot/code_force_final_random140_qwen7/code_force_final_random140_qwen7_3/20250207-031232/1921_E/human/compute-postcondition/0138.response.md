Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Draw', 'Alice'**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains the strings `'Bob'`, `'Alice'`, and `'Draw'`. After appending `'Alice'`, the list `answers` now contains `'Bob'`, `'Alice'`, `'Draw'`, and another `'Alice'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
