Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4; `answers` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
        answers.append('Draw')
    elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2
        ] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0:
        if clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
            if clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
    elif clues[3] == clues[5]:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
        if clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
        if clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user. The conditions for the contents of `answers` are as follows:
- If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` equals 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'.
- Otherwise, `answers` contains either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the parity (even or odd) of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, and the relationship between `clues[5]` and `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Specifically, if both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even and `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, then `answers` contains 'Draw'; otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw', `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw'. Based on the conditions of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` being either both even or both odd, the `answers` list is modified as follows:
- If `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, 'Bob' is appended to the `answers` list.
- If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, the `answers` list is changed to contain 'Bob', 'Alice', and 'Draw', with 'Alice' being the last element.
- If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not 1, and the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, the `answers` list remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to the `answers` list if the first condition is met, or 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list if the second condition is met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
