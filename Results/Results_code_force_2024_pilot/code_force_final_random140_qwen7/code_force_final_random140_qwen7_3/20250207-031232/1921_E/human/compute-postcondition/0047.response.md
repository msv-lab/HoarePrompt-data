Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers where `n` is the first element, `m` is the second element, `x1` is incremented by `a`, `y1` is adjusted (either incremented by `a` or decremented by `a`), `x2` is the fifth element, `y2` is either 1 or `m`, `a` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on whether `y1 >= y2` is true or false, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is not decreased by `a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is not greater than `n`. Additionally, `c` is either `y1 - 1` or `m - y1`.
