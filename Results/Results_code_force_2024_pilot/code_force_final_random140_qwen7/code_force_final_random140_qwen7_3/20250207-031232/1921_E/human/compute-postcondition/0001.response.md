Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is the third element of r, y1 is the fourth element of r, x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r.**

Explanation: The code unpacks the first six elements of the list `r` into variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `r` is now known to contain exactly six integers.
