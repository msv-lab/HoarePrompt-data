Based on the initial state provided:

- `test_cases` is a positive integer.
- `i` is equal to `test_cases`.
- `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user for each iteration.
- `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw' for each of the `test_cases` iterations.
- `answers` must have at least one element.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(j)
```

Here, `j` is not defined anywhere in the given initial state or within the provided code snippet. Since `j` is not defined, it will result in a NameError if the code were to run. Therefore, the code snippet as given will not execute successfully due to an undefined variable.

However, following the instructions to determine what would be printed based on the provided information, we can conclude that since `j` is not defined, the print statement will raise an error.

Output: **NameError: name 'j' is not defined**
