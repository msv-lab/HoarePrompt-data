Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(test_cases)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw'.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, converted to integers using `map` and `split`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < test_cases`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `test_cases` must remain the same because it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.
   - The list `clues` and the list `answers` do not change within the loop and are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw'**.
