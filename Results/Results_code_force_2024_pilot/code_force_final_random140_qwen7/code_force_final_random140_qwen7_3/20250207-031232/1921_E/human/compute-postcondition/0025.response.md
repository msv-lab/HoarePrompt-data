Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers where `n` is the first element, `m` is the second element, `x1` is incremented by 1, `y1` is either incremented by 1 or one less than the original `y1`, `x2` is the fifth element, and `y2` is the sixth element, `a` is `m - y2`.**

In this output state, the variable `a` is assigned the value `m - y2`, while all other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
