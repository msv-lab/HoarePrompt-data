Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `test_cases`, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user for each iteration, and `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw' for each of the `test_cases` iterations. The final state of `answers` will be a list of results determined by the conditions specified within the loop for each set of `clues` provided. Each element in `answers` corresponds to the outcome ('Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw') for each test case processed during the loop's execution.
