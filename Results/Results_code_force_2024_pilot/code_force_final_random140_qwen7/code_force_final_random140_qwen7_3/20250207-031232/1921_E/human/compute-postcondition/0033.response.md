Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `r` is a list containing six integers:
     - `n` is the first element.
     - `m` is the second element.
     - `x1` is incremented by `a`.
     - `y1` is either incremented by 1 or one less than the original `y1`.
     - `x2` is the fifth element.
     - `y2` is the sixth element.
   - `a` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on whether `y1 >= y2` is true or false.
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`.
   - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('draw')`.

Given this information, the print statement `print('draw')` will simply print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
