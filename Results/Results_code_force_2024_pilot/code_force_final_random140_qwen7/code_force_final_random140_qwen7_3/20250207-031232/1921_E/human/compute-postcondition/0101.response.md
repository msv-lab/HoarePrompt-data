Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split. If `clues[3] == clues[5]`, then `i` is set to 2. If `clues[3] != clues[5]`, then `i` is 2 if `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise `i` remains 2.**
