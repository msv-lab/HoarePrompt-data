Output State: `test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `test_cases`, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user for each iteration, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw' for each of the `test_cases` iterations, and `answers` must have exactly `test_cases` elements.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be reduced to 0 since it starts at the value of `test_cases` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The loop continues to print the elements of the `answers` list until `i` becomes 0. Therefore, by the end of the loop, `i` will be 0, and `answers` will contain all the results from the `test_cases` iterations as specified.
