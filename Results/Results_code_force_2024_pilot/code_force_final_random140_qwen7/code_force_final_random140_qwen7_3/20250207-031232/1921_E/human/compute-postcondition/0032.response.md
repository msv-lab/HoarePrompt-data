Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers where `n` is the first element, `m` is the second element, `x1` is incremented by `a`, `y1` is either incremented by 1 or one less than the original `y1`, `x2` is the fifth element, `y2` is the sixth element, `a` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on whether `y1 >= y2` is true or false, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, the current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1` or `x1` is less than 1 or `x2` is greater than `n`.
