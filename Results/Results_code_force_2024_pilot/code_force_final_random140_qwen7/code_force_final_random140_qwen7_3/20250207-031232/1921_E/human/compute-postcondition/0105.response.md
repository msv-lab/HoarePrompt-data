Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Bob'`, `'Alice'`, or `'Draw'`. After appending `'Alice'`, the list now contains `'Bob'`, `'Alice'`, and possibly the original `'Alice'` or `'Draw'` depending on the initial state. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2) because the code does not directly modify `i`, but the context implies it might be part of a loop or sequence where `i` is tracking iterations. The variables `test_cases` and `clues` remain unchanged from their initial states.
