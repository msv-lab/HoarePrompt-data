Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It returns None in most cases, except when it returns `y2 - 1` if certain conditions are met, or `m - y2` under specific conditions.**

This means the function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Based on the given cases, it returns `None` in several instances. It returns `y2 - 1` if the absolute difference between `x2` and `y2 - 1` is greater than or equal to the sum of `x1` and `y2 - 1`, and it returns `m - y2` if the absolute difference between `x2` and `m - y2` is greater than or equal to the sum of `x1` and `m - y2`. In other cases, it returns `None`.
