Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw'. If `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then the function does not change the `answers` list. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list.**
