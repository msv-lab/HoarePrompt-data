Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, then the `answers` list is changed to contain 'Bob', 'Alice', and 'Draw', with 'Alice' being the last element. Otherwise, if `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, the `answers` list remains unchanged. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list.
