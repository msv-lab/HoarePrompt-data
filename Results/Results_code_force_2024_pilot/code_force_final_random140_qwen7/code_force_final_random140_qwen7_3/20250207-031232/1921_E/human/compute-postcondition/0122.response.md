Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Draw'**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contained the strings `'Bob'` and `'Alice'`. After appending `'Draw'`, `answers` becomes a list containing `'Bob'`, `'Alice'`, and `'Draw'`. The values of `test_cases` and `i` remain unchanged, and `clues` remains a list of integers entered by the user.
