Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, then the `answers` list remains unchanged and contains either 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw', with 'Alice' being added if the specific condition in the else part is met. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is not greater than half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list.
