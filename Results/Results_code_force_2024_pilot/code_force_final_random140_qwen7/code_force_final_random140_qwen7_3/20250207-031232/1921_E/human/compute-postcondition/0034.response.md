Output State: **The program returns a value for `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, given the conditions on `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `a`.**

This output state describes that the program returns the value of `t`, which is constrained by the initial conditions provided. Since no further operations are performed on `t` within the given code snippet, the value of `t` remains as per its initial definition.
