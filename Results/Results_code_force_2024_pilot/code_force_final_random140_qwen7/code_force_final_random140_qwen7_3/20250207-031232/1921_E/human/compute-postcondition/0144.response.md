Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw' with an additional element 'Alice' appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw'. After appending `'Alice'`, `answers` will contain these elements plus the new `'Alice'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
