Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Bob'`, `'Alice'`, or `'Draw'`. After appending `'Alice'`, the list `answers` now contains `'Bob'` and `'Alice'`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2) but no other changes occur to the other variables. Therefore, `test_cases` remains greater than 0, `answers` now includes `'Alice'`, `i` is now 2, and `clues` remains unchanged.
