Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers:
  - The first element (`n`) is the first element of `r`.
  - The second element (`m`) is the second element of `r`.
  - The third element (`x1`) is the third element of `r`.
  - The fourth element (`y1`) is the fourth element of `r`.
  - The fifth element (`x2`) is the fifth element of `r`.
  - The sixth element (`y2`) is the sixth element of `r`.
  - The first element of `r` (i.e., `x2`) is less than or equal to the third element of `r` (i.e., `x1`).

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply prints the string `'draw'`.

Output: **'draw'**
