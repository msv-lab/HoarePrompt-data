Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw'. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then the `answers` list remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, the `answers` list is changed to contain 'Bob', 'Alice', and 'Draw', with 'Alice' being the last element. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not 1, and the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, the `answers` list remains unchanged. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list.
