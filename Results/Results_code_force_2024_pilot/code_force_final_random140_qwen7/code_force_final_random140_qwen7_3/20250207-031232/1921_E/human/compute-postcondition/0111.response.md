Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split. This is because regardless of whether the condition `clues[3] > clues[5]` is true or false, `i` is set to 2.
