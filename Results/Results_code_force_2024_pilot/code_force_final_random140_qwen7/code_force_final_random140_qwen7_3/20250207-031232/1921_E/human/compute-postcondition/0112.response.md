Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split. If `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `i` is set to 2. Otherwise, `i` remains 2.**
