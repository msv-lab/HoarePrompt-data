Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers where `n` is the first element, `m` is the second element, `x1` is incremented by 1, `y1` is either incremented by 1 or one less than the original `y1`, `x2` is the fifth element, `y2` is the sixth element, `a` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on whether `y1 >= y2` is true or false, `b` is `x2 - x1`.**

The code `b = x2 - x1` calculates the difference between `x2` and `x1` and assigns it to `b`. The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
