Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 0, `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even, and 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `permutation` is a list of n zeros; `bottom_v` is 1; `top_v` is n.
Code of the loop:
while idx < k:
    multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx
    while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
        if idx % 2 == 0:
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
            bottom_v += 1
        else:
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
            top_v -= 1
        multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k
    idx += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx` is either 0 or 1 and it is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros where every `k`-th position (starting from the `idx`-th position) has been filled with values incrementing from `bottom_v` or decrementing from `top_v` based on whether `idx` is even or odd, `bottom_v` is equal to `n + 1 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx // k) * 2` and `top_v` is equal to `n - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx // k) * 2`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` equals `n` after all iterations of the loop have finished.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + nk + (n-1)`, where `n` is the total number of iterations; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v + n - 1`, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - n + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `idx` is either 3 or 4; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` + 3*k + 1; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` is greater than 3; `bottom_v` is increased by 3; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is 5.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
