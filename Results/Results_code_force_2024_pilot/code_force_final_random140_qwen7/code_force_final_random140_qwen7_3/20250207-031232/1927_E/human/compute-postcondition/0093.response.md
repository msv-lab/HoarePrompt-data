Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` + 2*k + 1; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` is greater than 3; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is 4; otherwise, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` remains 4.**

Explanation: The value of `top_v` is decreased by 1. Initially, if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `top_v` which is 5, so it becomes 4. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `top_v - 1` which is also 4. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
