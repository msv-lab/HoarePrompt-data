Output State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is either 1 or 2; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`; `bottom_v` is `bottom_v` + 1; `len(permutation)` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `idx` remains either 1 or 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains either 1 or 2, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is still `bottom_v`, and `len(permutation)` is still greater than 1.
