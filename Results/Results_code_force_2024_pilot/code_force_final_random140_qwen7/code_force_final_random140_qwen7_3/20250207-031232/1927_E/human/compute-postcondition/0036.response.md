To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `idx` and `k`.

1. **Initial Condition**: The loop condition is `idx < k`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `idx` is either 0 or 1 and it is incremented by 1. This means `idx` is now either 1 or 2.
3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must be less than `k`. Since `idx` is now either 1 or 2, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is greater than 2.

Given the constraints:
- \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)

Since `idx` is either 1 or 2, the smallest possible value for `k` that would allow the loop to execute one more time is 3. Therefore, `k` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `idx` and `k`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2, `k` must be greater than 2**
