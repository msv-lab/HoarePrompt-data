Output State: **`idx` is 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element (index 0) set to `n`, `bottom_v` is 0, `top_v` is `n-1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `top_v -= 1` decreases the value of `top_v` by 1. Initially, `top_v` was set to `n`. After executing this line, `top_v` becomes `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
