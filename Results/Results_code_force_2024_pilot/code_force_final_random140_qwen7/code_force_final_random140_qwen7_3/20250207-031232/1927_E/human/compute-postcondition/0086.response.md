Postcondition: `idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` + `k`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` is greater than 3. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `bottom_v` which is 4. Otherwise, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` remains as `top_v - 1`.
