Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `idx` remains either 0 or 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with one element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx + k` updated, `bottom_v` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether `idx` is 0 or 1, `top_v` is either `n` or `n-1` depending on the condition of the if statement, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than the length of `permutation` before the next iteration.**

In this output state, the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been incremented by the value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
