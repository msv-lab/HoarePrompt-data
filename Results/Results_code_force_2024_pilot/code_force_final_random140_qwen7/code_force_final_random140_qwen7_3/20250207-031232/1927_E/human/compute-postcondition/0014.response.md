Output State: **`idx` is 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element (index 0) set to `n`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `n`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` to `top_v`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is initially 0 and `top_v` is `n`, the first element of the `permutation` list is updated to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
