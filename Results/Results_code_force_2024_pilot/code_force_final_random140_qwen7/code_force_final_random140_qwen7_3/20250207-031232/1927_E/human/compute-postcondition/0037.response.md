Output State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is either 1 or 2**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx` assigns the value of `idx` to `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. Since `idx` is either 1 or 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will also be either 1 or 2. The condition that `k` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
