Output State: `t` is less than or equal to 0.

Natural Language Description: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be less than or equal to 0, as it starts greater than 0 and is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it no longer satisfies the condition `t > 0`.
