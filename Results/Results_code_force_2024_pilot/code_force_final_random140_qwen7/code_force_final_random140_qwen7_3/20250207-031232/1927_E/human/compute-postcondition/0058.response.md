Output State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + 2k + 1`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - 1`; otherwise, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`; `bottom_v` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
