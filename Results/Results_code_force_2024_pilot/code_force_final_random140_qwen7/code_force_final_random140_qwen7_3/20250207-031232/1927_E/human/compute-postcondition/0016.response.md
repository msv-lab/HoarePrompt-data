Postcondition: **`idx` is either 0 or 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros; `bottom_v` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether `idx` is 0 or 1; `top_v` is `n`; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 0.**
