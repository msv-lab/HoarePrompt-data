Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.
2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is either 1 or 2.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + 2k`.
   - `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.
   - If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)` must hold true. Given that `len(permutation)` is already greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, the only thing that needs adjustment is to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is incremented such that it remains less than `len(permutation)`.

Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is defined as `idx + 2k` and `idx` is either 1 or 2, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is either `1 + 2k` or `2 + 2k`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be incremented by 1 (since it is an integer index).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this increment.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + 2k + 1`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v + 1`; otherwise, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - 1`**
