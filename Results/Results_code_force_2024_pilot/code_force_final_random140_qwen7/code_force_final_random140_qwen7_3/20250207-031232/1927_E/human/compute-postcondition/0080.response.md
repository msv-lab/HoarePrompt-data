Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` + `k`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` is greater than 3; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v` (which is 3); otherwise, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is incremented by `k`. Since `idx` is either 2 or 3, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be `idx + k`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
