Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` + `k`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` is greater than 3; `bottom_v` is 4**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
