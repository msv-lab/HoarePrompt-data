Output State: `idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + nk + (n-1)`, where `n` is the total number of iterations; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v + n - 1`, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - n + 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `idx` will still be either 1 or 2. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be `idx + nk + (n-1)`, where `n` is the total number of iterations of the loop. The length of `permutation` must still be greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. If `idx` is even, the last assigned value to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` will be `bottom_v + n - 1`. If `idx` is odd, the last assigned value will be `top_v - n + 1`. The variables `bottom_v` and `top_v` will have been incremented and decremented respectively over the course of the loop, but their exact final values are not specified in the problem statement.
