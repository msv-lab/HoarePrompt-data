Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is either 1 or 2.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + k`.
   - `len(permutation)` is greater than 1.

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)` must be true. 

Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx + k` and `len(permutation) > 1`, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is still less than `len(permutation)` for the next iteration.

Since `idx` can be either 1 or 2, let's consider both cases:
- If `idx` is 1, then `multiples_of_k_plus_idx = 1 + k`.
- If `idx` is 2, then `multiples_of_k_plus_idx = 2 + k`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is still less than `len(permutation)`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains less than `len(permutation)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + k`, and `len(permutation)` must be greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`**
