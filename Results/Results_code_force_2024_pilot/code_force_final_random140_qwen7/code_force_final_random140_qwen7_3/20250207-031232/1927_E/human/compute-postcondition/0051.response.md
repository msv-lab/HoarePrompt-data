Output State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + k`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is equal to `top_v`; `len(permutation)` must be greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `top_v` to the element in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is defined as `idx + k`, and `idx` is either 1 or 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be either `1 + k` or `2 + k`. The length of the `permutation` list remains greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.
