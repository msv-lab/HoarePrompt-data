Output State: **`idx` is either 0 or 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros where one element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is set to `bottom_v + 1`; `top_v` is `n`; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`**.

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. Since `bottom_v` was either 2 or 0 depending on the value of `idx`, it is now either 3 or 1. The `permutation` list remains unchanged except for the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, which was previously set to `bottom_v`. Now, it is set to `bottom_v + 1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
