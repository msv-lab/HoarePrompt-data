Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` must be greater than 3; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v + n - 1`, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - n + 1**.

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx` simply assigns the value of `idx` to `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` now holds the same value as `idx`, which is either 2 or 3. All other conditions and variable states remain as they were in the initial state.
