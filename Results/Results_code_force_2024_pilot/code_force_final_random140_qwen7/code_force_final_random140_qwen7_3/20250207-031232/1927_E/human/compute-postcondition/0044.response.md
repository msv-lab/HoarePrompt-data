Output State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is either 1 or 2; `len(permutation)` is greater than 1; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is assigned to `top_v - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `top_v` is decremented by 1. Since `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` was previously assigned to `top_v`, it now becomes `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
