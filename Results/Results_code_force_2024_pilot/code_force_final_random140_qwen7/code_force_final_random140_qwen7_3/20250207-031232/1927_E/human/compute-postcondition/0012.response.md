Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even. For each test case, it does not return a specific value but processes the inputs and may perform some operations or calculations based on these inputs.**

This means the function `func_2` is designed to handle multiple test cases (specified by `t`). For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` as inputs, ensuring that `k` is even and within the specified range relative to `n`. The function processes these inputs but does not explicitly return a value from the function itself; instead, it performs operations or calculations based on the given constraints.
