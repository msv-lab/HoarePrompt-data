Output State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + 3k + 1`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - 1`, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v + 1` if `idx` is odd, and `bottom_v` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. Given that initially `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was `idx + 2k + 1`, after adding `k`, the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` becomes `idx + 3k + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
