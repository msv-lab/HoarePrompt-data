Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` + `k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, `k` is greater than 3, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `top_v` is decremented by 1. Since `top_v` was initially equal to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`, now `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is equal to `top_v - 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
