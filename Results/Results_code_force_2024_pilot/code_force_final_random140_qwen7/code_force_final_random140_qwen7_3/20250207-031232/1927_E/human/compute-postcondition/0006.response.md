Output State: **`t` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The initial state is that `t` must be greater than 1. The code `t -= 1` decrements `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially greater than 1, after decrementing by 1, `t` will be greater than 0 but not necessarily greater than 1. Therefore, the updated state is that `t` is greater than 0.
