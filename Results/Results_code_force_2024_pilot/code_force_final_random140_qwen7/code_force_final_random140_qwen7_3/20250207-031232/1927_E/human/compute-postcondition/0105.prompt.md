You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    bottom_v = 1
    top_v = n
    idx = 0
    while idx < k:
        multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx
        
        while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
            if idx % 2 == 0:
                permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
                bottom_v += 1
            else:
                permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
                top_v -= 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `idx` is either 3 or 4, `n` is an integer obtained from the input with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` based on the value of `idx` modulo 2, `bottom_v` is increased by 3 from its initial value, and `top_v` is decreased by 3 from its initial value, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` equals `n`.
    #
    #To understand this final state:
    #- The loop runs until `idx` reaches `k`. Since `k` is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n\), `idx` will eventually reach `k`.
    #- During each iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated by adding `k` until it reaches or exceeds `n`.
    #- After all iterations, `idx` will be `k` (if `k` is less than or equal to 4, then `idx` will be `k` or `k+1`).
    #- `bottom_v` starts at 1 and increases by 1 for each valid index it fills, so after 3 iterations, it increases by 3.
    #- `top_v` starts at `n` and decreases by 1 for each valid index it fills, so after 3 iterations, it decreases by 3.
    #- Each valid index filled alternates between `bottom_v` and `top_v` based on whether `idx` is even or odd.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is undefined)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It returns an error message if k is not even or if the conditions 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 are not met. If the conditions are met, it does not return anything specific as the problem statement does not mention a return value under valid conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
