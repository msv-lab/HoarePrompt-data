Output State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + k`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `bottom_v` is now `bottom_v + 1`. The other conditions and values of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.
