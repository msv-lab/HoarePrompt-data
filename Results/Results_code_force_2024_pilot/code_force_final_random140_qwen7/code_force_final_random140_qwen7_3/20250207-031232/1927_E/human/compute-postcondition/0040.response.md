Output State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is either 1 or 2, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`, and `len(permutation)` must be greater than 1.**

The value of `idx` remains either 1 or 2 because the condition that `idx` is even is still satisfied (since both 1 and 2 are even, and no operation changes this). The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains either 1 or 2 as it is not affected by the code. The `permutation` list is modified such that the element at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now equal to `bottom_v`. The length of `permutation` remains greater than 1 as no operation affects its length.
