Output State: **`idx` is either 0 or 1 and it is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros where every `k`-th position (starting from the `idx`-th position) has been filled with values incrementing from `bottom_v` or decrementing from `top_v` based on whether `idx` is even or odd, `bottom_v` is equal to `n + 1 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx // k) * 2` and `top_v` is equal to `n - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx // k) * 2`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` equals `n` after all iterations of the loop have finished.**

Explanation: The line `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Since `idx` was initially either 0 or 1, after this operation, `idx` will now be 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1. However, since the problem specifies that `idx` remains either 0 or 1, the only valid change is that `idx` becomes 1 if it was 0. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `permutation`, `bottom_v`, `top_v`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code.
