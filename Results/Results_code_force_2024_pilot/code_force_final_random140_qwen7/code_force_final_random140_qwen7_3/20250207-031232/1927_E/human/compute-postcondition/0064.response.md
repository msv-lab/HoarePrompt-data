Output State: `idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + nk + 1`, where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - (n - 1)`, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v + n`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `idx` will still be either 1 or 2. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be `idx + nk + 1`, indicating it has incremented by `k` for each iteration plus one additional increment. The length of `permutation` will be greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. If `idx` is even, the last assigned value in `permutation` at `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be `top_v - (n - 1)`, reflecting the decrementing pattern. If `idx` is odd, the last assigned value will be `bottom_v + n`, showing the incrementing pattern.
