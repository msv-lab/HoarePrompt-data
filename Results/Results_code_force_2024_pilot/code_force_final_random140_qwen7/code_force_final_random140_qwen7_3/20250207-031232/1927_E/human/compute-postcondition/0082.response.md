Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` + `k`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` is greater than 3; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v` (which is 3)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` to `bottom_v`, which is 3. Since `idx` is either 2 or 3, and given the conditions for `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `k`, the updated state includes that the specified index in `permutation` now holds the value `bottom_v`.
