Output State: The `idx` variable remains either 0 or 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros where every `k`-th position (starting from the `idx`-th position) has been filled with values incrementing from `bottom_v` (which starts as 1 and increments by 1 each time `idx` is even) or decrementing from `top_v` (which starts as `n` and decrements by 1 each time `idx` is odd). `bottom_v` is equal to `n + 1 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx // k) * 2` and `top_v` is equal to `n - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx // k) * 2`. `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` equals `n` after all iterations of the loop have finished.

This means that after all iterations, the `permutation` list will have elements placed at positions determined by the `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` value incremented by `k` each time, alternating between increasing and decreasing values based on whether `idx` is even or odd.
