To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions given:

1. **Loop Head**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.

Given the loop condition, for the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than the length of `permutation`. 

From the information provided:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k` in each iteration.
- Initially, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is set to some value based on `idx` and `k`.

For the loop to continue, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than the length of `permutation` after the increment.

Since the only variable that affects the loop continuation is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than the length of `permutation` before the next iteration.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than the length of `permutation`.

**State:**
- `idx` is either 0 or 1 (no change needed as this doesn't affect the loop condition).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input (no change needed as this doesn't affect the loop condition).
- `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) (no change needed as this doesn't affect the loop condition).
- `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with one element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx + k` updated (no change needed as this doesn't affect the loop condition).
- `bottom_v` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether `idx` is 0 or 1 (no change needed as this doesn't affect the loop condition).
- `top_v` is either `n` or `n-1` depending on the condition of the if statement (no change needed as this doesn't affect the loop condition).
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than the length of `permutation` before the next iteration.

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than the length of `permutation`**
