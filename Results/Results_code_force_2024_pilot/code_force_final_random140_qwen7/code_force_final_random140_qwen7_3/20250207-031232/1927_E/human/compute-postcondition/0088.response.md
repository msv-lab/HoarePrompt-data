Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` + 2*k; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` is greater than 3; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v` (which is 4); otherwise, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` remains `top_v - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was originally equal to `idx + k`, after executing the line, its new value becomes `idx + 2*k`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
