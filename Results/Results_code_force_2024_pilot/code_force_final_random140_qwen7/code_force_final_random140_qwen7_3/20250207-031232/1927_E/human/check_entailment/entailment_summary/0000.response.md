Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating a k-level permutation of length n for each test case.
2. The provided code consists of two functions:
   - `func_1()`: Constructs a k-level permutation for a single test case.
   - `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

3. Let's analyze `func_1()`:
   - It correctly reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length \(n\) filled with zeros.
   - It uses two variables `bottom_v` and `top_v` initialized to 1 and \(n\), respectively.
   - It fills the list according to the specified rules: elements at indices that are multiples of \(k\) plus the current index are filled with `bottom_v`, and other elements are filled with `top_v`.
   - The filling pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \(k\) will be close to each other, making the permutation k-level.

4. Now, let's analyze `func_2()`:
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1()` and then decrements \(t\).
   - This ensures that all test cases are handled correctly.

5. Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the construction method used in `func_1()` should produce a valid k-level permutation for each test case. The approach of alternating between `bottom_v` and `top_v` ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \(k\) will not differ by more than 1.

Conclusion:
Since both functions together handle the problem correctly according to the provided specifications and constraints, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
