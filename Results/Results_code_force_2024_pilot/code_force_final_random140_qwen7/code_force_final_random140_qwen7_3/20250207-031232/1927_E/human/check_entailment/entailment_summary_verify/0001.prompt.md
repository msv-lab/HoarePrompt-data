You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    bottom_v = 1
    top_v = n
    idx = 0
    while idx < k:
        multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx
        while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
            if idx % 2 == 0:
                permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
                bottom_v += 1
            else:
                permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
                top_v -= 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k
        idx += 1
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes up to `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` (with 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k being even). It then calls another function `func_1()` for each test case without returning any specific value. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the variable `t` is less than or equal to 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation of length n.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The function `func_1()` constructs the permutation.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two variables `bottom_v` and `top_v` initialized to 1 and `n`, respectively.
   - It iterates over indices from 0 to `k-1` (inclusive).
     - For each index `idx`, it updates elements at positions `idx`, `idx+k`, `idx+2k`, etc., in the permutation list.
     - If `idx` is even, it assigns the current value of `bottom_v` to the position and increments `bottom_v`.
     - If `idx` is odd, it assigns the current value of `top_v` to the position and decrements `top_v`.

3. **Output:**
   - The constructed permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

### Verification of k-Level Property

To verify if the constructed permutation is k-level, we need to check if the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length `k` is at most 1.

#### Example Test Case:
- Let's consider the test case `n = 10` and `k = 4`.

#### Permutation Construction:
- The initial permutation is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- After processing:
  - For `idx = 0` (even): `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - For `idx = 1` (odd): `[1, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - For `idx = 2` (even): `[1, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - For `idx = 3` (odd): `[1, 10, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

#### Sum Calculation:
- Sums of segments of length 4:
  - Segment starting at index 0: `1 + 10 + 3 + 9 = 23`
  - Segment starting at index 1: `10 + 3 + 9 + 0 = 22`
  - Segment starting at index 2: `3 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 12`
  - Segment starting at index 3: `9 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9`

#### Maximum and Minimum Sums:
- Maximum sum: `23`
- Minimum sum: `9`
- Difference: `23 - 9 = 14`

This shows that the constructed permutation does not satisfy the k-level property for this example.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation because the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length `k` can be greater than 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
