Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even and the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length k should not exceed 1.
2. The annotated program correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_2()`, which in turn calls `func_1()` for each test case.
3. In `func_1()`, the logic for constructing the permutation is as follows:
   - Initialize `bottom_v` to 1 and `top_v` to n.
   - Use a while loop to fill the permutation list, alternating between `bottom_v` and `top_v` based on the parity of `idx`.
   - Increment `bottom_v` and decrement `top_v` after each segment is filled.
4. The permutation construction logic ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in any segment of length k is at most 1, thus satisfying the k-level condition.
5. The code correctly handles the constraints and guarantees that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
