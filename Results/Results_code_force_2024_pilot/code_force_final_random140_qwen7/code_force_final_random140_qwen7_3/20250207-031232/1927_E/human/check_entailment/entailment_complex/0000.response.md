### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1()` correctly initializes the variables `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `bottom_v`, `top_v`, and `idx`.
   - It constructs a permutation of length `n` where each segment of length `k` has sums differing by no more than 1.
   - The logic inside the nested loops ensures that elements at indices that are multiples of `k` plus the current index are filled with `bottom_v` (starting from 1 and increasing by 1 for each valid index), and elements at other indices are filled with `top_v` (starting from `n` and decreasing by 1 for each valid index).
   - This approach ensures that the sums of any two consecutive segments of length `k` will differ by at most 1, satisfying the k-level condition.

2. **Function `func_2()` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.
   - After processing all test cases, it ensures that `t` is reduced to 0, indicating all test cases have been processed.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program structure is correct and follows the problem description.
   - It handles multiple test cases and constructs the required k-level permutations for each test case.
   - The logic in both functions is sound and meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the program correctly implements the solution for constructing k-level permutations for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
