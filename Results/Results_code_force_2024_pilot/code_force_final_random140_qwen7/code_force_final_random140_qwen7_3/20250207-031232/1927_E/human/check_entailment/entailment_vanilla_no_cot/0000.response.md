Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly generate a k-level permutation. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. Instead, it simply alternates between the smallest and largest remaining values, which does not guarantee the required property.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the sums of the segments of length `k` are as close as possible to each other. One way to achieve this is by constructing the permutation in a specific pattern that balances the sums.

Here's a corrected approach:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = list(range(1, n + 1))
    
    # Distribute numbers to balance the sums
    for i in range(k // 2):
        for j in range(i, n, k):
            permutation[j], permutation[j + k // 2] = permutation[j + k // 2], permutation[j]
    
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1
```

This approach ensures that the permutation is constructed in a way that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` are balanced. By swapping elements symmetrically around the middle of the segment, we can achieve the required property.
