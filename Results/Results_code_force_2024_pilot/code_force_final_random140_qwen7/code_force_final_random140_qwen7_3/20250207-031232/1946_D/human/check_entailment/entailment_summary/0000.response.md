Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `find_new` aligns with the problem statement and the expected output.

### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to find the maximum number of segments `[l_i, r_i]` such that:
  - `l_1 = 1`, `r_k = n`.
  - `l_i <= r_i` for all `i`.
  - `r_i + 1 = l_{i+1}` for all `i` from 1 to `k-1`.
  - The bitwise OR of the XORs of elements in these segments is less than or equal to `x`.

### Function Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(arr, x)`**:
   - This function calls `find_new(arr, 30)`, which means it starts processing the array with the highest bit position (30).

2. **Function `find_new(cur_arr, bit)`**:
   - This function processes the array based on the current bit position.
   - If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of the array, indicating that all bits have been processed.
   - It constructs a new array `new_arr` where elements are accumulated until the XOR of the accumulated elements does not have the `bit`-th bit set.
   - Depending on the value of `x` and the bit, it either returns the maximum of 1 and the result of a recursive call with the next bit or returns a specific value from `new_arr` or -1.

### Verification:
- The function `find_new` correctly handles the bitwise operations and ensures that the XORs of the segments do not exceed `x`.
- The recursion ensures that the function processes each bit position, and the conditions ensure that the segments are formed optimally.
- The base case (`bit == -1`) correctly returns the length of the array when all bits have been processed.

Given the detailed implementation and the logical steps involved, the functions correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
