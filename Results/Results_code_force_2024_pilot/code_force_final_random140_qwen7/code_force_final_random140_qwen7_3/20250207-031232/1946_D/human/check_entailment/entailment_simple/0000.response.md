### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments such that the cumulative bitwise XOR of each segment does not exceed a given value \( x \).

2. **Function `find_new` Analysis**:
   - The function `find_new` is designed to process the array by considering each bit position from the most significant to the least significant.
   - For each bit position, it creates a new array (`new_arr`) containing intermediate XOR results where the current bit is zero.
   - If the current bit of \( x \) is set (i.e., \( x >> bit & 1 \)), it recursively calls `find_new` for the next bit position, taking the maximum of the current segment count and the result of the recursive call.
   - If the current bit of \( x \) is not set, it further processes the `new_arr` for the next bit position if the segment count is not -1.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `bit` becomes -1, the function returns the length of the array, indicating the number of segments that can be formed without considering any bits.

4. **Recursive Processing**:
   - The function correctly handles the recursive processing of each bit position, ensuring that the cumulative XOR of each segment does not exceed \( x \).
   - The function ensures that the segments are contiguous and follow the required conditions.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where no valid segments can be formed by returning -1 when necessary.

6. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `find_new` with the initial bit position set to 30 (since \( x \) is a 30-bit integer).
   - This ensures that all bit positions are considered in the correct order.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `find_new` processes the array bit by bit, ensuring that the cumulative XOR of each segment does not exceed \( x \), and returns the maximum number of such segments.
