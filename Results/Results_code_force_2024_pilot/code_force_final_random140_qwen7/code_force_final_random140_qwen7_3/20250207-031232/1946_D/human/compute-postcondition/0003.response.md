Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing the current state of the array being processed, `bit` is a non-negative integer representing the current bit position being considered, and `new_arr` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `new_arr`. The values of `cur_arr` and `bit` remain unchanged from their initial state.
