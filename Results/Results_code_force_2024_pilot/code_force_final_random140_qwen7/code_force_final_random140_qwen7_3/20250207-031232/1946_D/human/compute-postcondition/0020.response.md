Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`, and `new_arr` remains unchanged if `xor` is not 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the value of `i`. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `i`, `new_arr`) remain unchanged unless specified otherwise. Since the exact value of `i` is not given, we keep it as the "next element in `cur_arr`." The state of `new_arr` remains unchanged if `xor` is not 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`, which is also kept as is.
