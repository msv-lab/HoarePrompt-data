Output State: **After all iterations, `cur_arr` will be an empty list, `i` will be undefined since `cur_arr` is empty, `xor` will be the final cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in the original `cur_arr` list, and `new_arr` will contain all the intermediate values of `xor` that were appended when `xor` became 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop, the `cur_arr` list will be exhausted, meaning it will be empty. The variable `i` will be undefined as there are no elements left to iterate over. The variable `xor` will hold the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr` list together. The `new_arr` list will contain all the values of `xor` that were reset to 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`, indicating that those values of `xor` did not have a 1 in the `bit`-th position when shifted right.
