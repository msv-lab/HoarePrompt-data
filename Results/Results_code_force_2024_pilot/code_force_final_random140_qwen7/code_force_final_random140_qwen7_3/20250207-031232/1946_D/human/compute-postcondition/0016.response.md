Output State: **`xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, and `new_arr` is a list containing one additional element which is the current value of `xor`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `xor` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `i`, or `new_arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while updating `xor` to 0.
