The function `find_new` accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers representing the current state of the array being processed, and `bit`, which is a non-negative integer representing the current bit position being considered. 

Based on the conditions given:
- Case_1: The function returns the length of the list `cur_arr`.
- Case_2: The function returns the maximum value between 1 (the value of `thing1`) and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`.
- Case_3: The function returns a value from the list `new_arr` where the bit at position `bit - 1` is set to 1.
- Case_4: The function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `find_new` is to accept a list `cur_arr` and a bit position `bit`, and based on certain conditions, return either the length of `cur_arr`, the maximum value between 1 and the result of a recursive call to itself with a decremented bit position, a specific value from `new_arr` where the bit at the specified position is set, or -1.
