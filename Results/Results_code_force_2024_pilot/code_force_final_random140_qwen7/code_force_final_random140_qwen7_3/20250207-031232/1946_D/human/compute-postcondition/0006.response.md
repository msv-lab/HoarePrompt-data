Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`, and `xor` is the bitwise XOR of `i` and the original `xor` value**.

Explanation: The code `xor ^= i` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the first element `i` of the list `cur_arr`. This changes the value of `xor` to the result of this operation. The values of `cur_arr` and `i` remain unchanged.
