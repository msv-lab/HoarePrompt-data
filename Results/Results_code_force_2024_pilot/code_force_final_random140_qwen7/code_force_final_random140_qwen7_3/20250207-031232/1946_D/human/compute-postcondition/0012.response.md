Postcondition: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`, and `xor` is the bitwise XOR of `i` and the original `xor` value. If `xor` is 0 after shifting right by `bit` and bitwise AND with 1, then `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`, which is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cur_arr`, `i`, and `xor` remain unchanged.
