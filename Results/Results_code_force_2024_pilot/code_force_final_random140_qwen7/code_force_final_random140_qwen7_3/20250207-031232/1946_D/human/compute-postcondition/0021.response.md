Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`, `new_arr` now contains the value of `xor`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `xor` to `new_arr`. Since `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`, the new value of `new_arr` is the updated `xor`. All other variables retain their previous states.
