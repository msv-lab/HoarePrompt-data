Postcondition: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`, and `new_arr` now contains the value of `xor` if `xor` is 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`.
