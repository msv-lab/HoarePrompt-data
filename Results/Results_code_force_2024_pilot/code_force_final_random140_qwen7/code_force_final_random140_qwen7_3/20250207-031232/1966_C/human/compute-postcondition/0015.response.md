Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is now the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing 0 as its first element followed by all elements from the list `arr` up to index `n-1`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
