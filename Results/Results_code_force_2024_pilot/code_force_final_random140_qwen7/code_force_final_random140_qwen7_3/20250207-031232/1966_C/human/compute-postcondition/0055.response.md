Output State: **`arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the updated states are `arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s` and `i` is incremented by 1.
