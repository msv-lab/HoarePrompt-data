The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr[i]` was added to the set `s`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`, and `n` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

Given that `arr[i]` was added to the set `s` in the last iteration, the state of `s` does not need to be modified as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` (which is now `i + 1`) and the condition that `n` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
