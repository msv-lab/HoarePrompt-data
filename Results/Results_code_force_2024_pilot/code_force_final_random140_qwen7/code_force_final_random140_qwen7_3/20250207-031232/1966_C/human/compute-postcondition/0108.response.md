Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a list of integers with a 0 prepended to the original list of unique elements from `arr`, and the variable `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends a `0` to the list `s`. Since `s` originally contains all unique elements from the list `arr` converted to a list, after executing the code, `s` will have a `0` added at the beginning of the list. The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged, and `n` also remains unchanged.
