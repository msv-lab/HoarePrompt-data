Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases implicitly through its input structure, where each test case consists of a positive integer t and a list of n integers. The function processes these inputs according to specified rules for each test case and returns a result for each one.
