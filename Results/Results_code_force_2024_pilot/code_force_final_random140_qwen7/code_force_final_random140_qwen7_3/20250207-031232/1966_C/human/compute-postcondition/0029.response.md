Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the length of list `s`.
   - The postcondition states that if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2 (as the loop increments `i` by 1).
   - `n` remains the same because it is determined by the length of the list `s`, which does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be set to 2.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of list `s`**.
