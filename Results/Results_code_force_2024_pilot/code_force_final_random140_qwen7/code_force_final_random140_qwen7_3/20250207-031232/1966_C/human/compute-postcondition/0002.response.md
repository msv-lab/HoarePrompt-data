Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
