Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either 0 or 1 (depending on whether the loop starts from 0 or 1).
   - `n` is a valid non-negative integer.
   - `s` is a set containing `arr[0]`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` was either 0 or 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will now be 1 or 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a valid non-negative integer and does not change within the loop.
   - The set `s` does not change because the loop body is omitted, and there is no operation that would modify `s`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1 or 2 (depending on the initial value).
   - `n` remains a valid non-negative integer.
   - `s` remains a set containing `arr[0]`.

Given this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `n` is a valid non-negative integer, `s` is a set containing `arr[0]`**.
