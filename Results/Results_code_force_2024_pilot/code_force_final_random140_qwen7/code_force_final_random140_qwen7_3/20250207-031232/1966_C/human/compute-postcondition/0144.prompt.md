Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    ans = 1
    s = [0] + s
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans = 1 - ans
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is now the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing 0 as its first element followed by all elements from the list `arr` up to index `n-1`, `ans` is 1, and either `n` is equal to 2 or `i` is 3 and `ans` is 0, and the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was not met for any `i` from 1 to 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is equal to the length of set `s`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `ans` is either true or false. If `n` equals 2, then `ans` remains true. Otherwise, the loop either breaks when it finds two consecutive elements in the set `s` such that `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, and `ans` remains true, or it continues to iterate until `ans` alternates between 0 and 1 for each iteration, remaining false if no such pair is found.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a list of integers with a 0 prepended to the original list of unique elements from `arr`, and `n` is the length of `s`. If `n` equals 2, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `ans` is true, it remains true; otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
