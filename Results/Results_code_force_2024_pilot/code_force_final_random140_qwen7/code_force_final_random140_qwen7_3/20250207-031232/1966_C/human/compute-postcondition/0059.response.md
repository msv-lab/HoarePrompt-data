Output State: The set `s` contains all elements from the list `arr`, and the variable `i` is equal to `n-1`. The variable `ans` remains 1, and the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was not met for any `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the set `s` will contain every unique element from the list `arr` exactly once. The variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, indicating the last index of the list `arr` that was processed. The variable `ans` stays as 1, and there were no gaps larger than 1 between consecutive elements in the set `s`.
