Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input from the user to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `t` retains its initial state as a positive integer within the specified range, and `n` is now an integer obtained from user input.
