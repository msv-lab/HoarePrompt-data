Output State: **`arr[i]` is added to set `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code adds `arr[i]` to the set `s`. It also increments `i` by 1. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` remains valid. The specific values of `arr[i]`, `i`, and `n` are not provided, so they are kept in their general form.
