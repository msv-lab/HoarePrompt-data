Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, the set `s` will contain all unique elements from the list `arr`, and the variable `ans` will retain its initial value (either true or false). The variable `n` will also remain unchanged, and `s` will be a set of integers where each element from `arr` has been added exactly once, assuming no duplicates were present initially.

In simpler terms, the set `s` will contain every unique integer from the list `arr`, and the value of `ans` will stay the same as it was before the loop started.
