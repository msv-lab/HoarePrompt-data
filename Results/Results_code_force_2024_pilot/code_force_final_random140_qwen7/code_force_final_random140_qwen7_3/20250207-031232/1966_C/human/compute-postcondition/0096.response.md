Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `ans` is either true or false, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is an empty set.**

The code creates an empty set named `s`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `ans`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
