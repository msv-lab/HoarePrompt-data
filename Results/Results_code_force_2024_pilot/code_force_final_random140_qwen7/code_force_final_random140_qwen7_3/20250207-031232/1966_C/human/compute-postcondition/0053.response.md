Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`. This means that `i` was incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if `i` was used in the previous iteration, it will now be `i + 1`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state such that `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` remains the same (since `n` does not change within the loop).

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous value.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i+1`**.

However, since the exact initial values of `i` and `n` are not provided, we can generalize the answer as follows:

**State: `arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i+1`**.
