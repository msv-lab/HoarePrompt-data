Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is a valid non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a set containing all elements from the list `arr` up to index `n-1`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The set `s` will contain every element from the list `arr` up to the `n-1`th index, as each element is added to the set `s` during each iteration of the loop.
