Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a list containing 0 as its first element followed by all elements from the list `arr` up to index `n-1`, `ans` is 1, either `n` is equal to 2 or `i` is 3 and `ans` is 0, and the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was not met for any `i` from 1 to 3; `arr` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states unless specified otherwise by the input.
