Output State: **`arr[i]` is added to set `s`.**

This means that the element at index `i` of the list `arr` is added to the set `s`. The set `s` now contains all unique elements from `arr` up to index `i`, and the value of `arr[i]` has been added to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
