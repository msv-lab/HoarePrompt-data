Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 3.
- `ans` is set to 0.
- The condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was not met for any `i` from 1 to 3.

The print statement is simply `print('Alice')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs a string without referencing any variables or objects whose values need to be determined, the output will be the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
