Output State: **`ans` is `1 - ans`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is equal to the length of set `s`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated to `1 - ans`, meaning its value is flipped between 0 and 1 (or 1 and 0). The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, with `i` being `i + 1` and `n` being the length of set `s`.
