Output State: **Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a list of integers with a 0 prepended to the original list of unique elements from `arr`, and `n` is the length of `s`, and `n` is greater than 2.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will reach `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `ans` will retain its final value after the last iteration of the loop, which depends on whether `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was true or false for the last valid `i` (i.e., `i` ranging from 1 to `n-2`). The list `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
