Postcondition: `ans` is 1 if `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, and 0 if `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1, where `i` is within the range [3, n-1], `n` is greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers with a 0 prepended to the original list of unique elements from `arr`, and `n` is the length of `s`. After executing the if-else block, `ans` retains its value based on whether `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1 or not.
