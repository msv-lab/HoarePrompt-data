Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is equal to the length of set `s`, `ans` is the opposite of its original value.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 1 - ans` changes the value of `ans` to its opposite. If `ans` was originally 1, it becomes 0, and if `ans` was originally 0, it becomes 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
