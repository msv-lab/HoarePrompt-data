Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is within the range [1, n-1], `n` is greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers with a 0 prepended to the original list of unique elements from `arr`, and `n` is the length of `s`, and `s[i] - s[i - 1] is less than or equal to 1**.

Explanation: The line `ans = 1 - ans` changes the value of `ans` from 1 to 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
