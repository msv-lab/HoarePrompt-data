Postcondition: **`n` is equal to the length of set `s`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `ans` is either true or false. If `n` equals 2, then `ans` remains true. Otherwise, the loop either breaks when it finds two consecutive elements in the set `s` such that `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, and `ans` remains true, or it continues to iterate until `ans` alternates between 0 and 1 for each iteration, remaining false if no such pair is found.**
