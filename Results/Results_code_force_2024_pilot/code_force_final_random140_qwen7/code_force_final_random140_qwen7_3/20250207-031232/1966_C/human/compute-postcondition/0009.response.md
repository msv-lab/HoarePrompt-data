Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `s` is a set containing `arr[0]`, `arr[2]`, and `arr[3]`**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is either 2 or 3, adding `arr[i]` to the set `s` which initially contains `arr[0]` and either `arr[2]` or `arr[3]` will result in the set containing `arr[0]`, `arr[2]`, and `arr[3]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 remain unchanged.
