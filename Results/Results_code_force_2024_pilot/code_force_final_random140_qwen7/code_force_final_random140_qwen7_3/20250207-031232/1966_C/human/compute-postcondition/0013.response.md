Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is a valid non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is now a list containing all elements from the list `arr` up to index `n-1`, `ans` is 1.**

The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, but no operations are performed on it or any other variables, so its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.
