Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is equal to the length of set `s', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is inside. Since no new assignments or operations are performed, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
