Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of beautiful pairs in the array \(a\) based on the given problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This ensures that each test case is handled separately, which is necessary given the problem constraints.

2. **Data Structure Usage**: A `defaultdict` is used to keep track of the frequency of `(mod_x, required_mod_y)` pairs. This helps in efficiently counting the number of beautiful pairs.

3. **Modulo Calculations**: The program correctly calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` for each element in the array. It then computes `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` to find the required conditions for a pair to be beautiful.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: The program iterates through the array and uses the frequency dictionary to count the number of beautiful pairs. If a required pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary, it increments the `beautiful_count`.

5. **Result Collection**: The results for each test case are collected in a list and returned at the end. This ensures that the output matches the expected format.

Given the execution summary, the program processes each test case independently and retains the state correctly between iterations. There are no signs of logical errors or issues with the implementation based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
