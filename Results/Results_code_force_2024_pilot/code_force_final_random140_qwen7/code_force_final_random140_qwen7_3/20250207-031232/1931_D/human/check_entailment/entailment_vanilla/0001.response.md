Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.

2. **Data Structure Initialization**:
   - A list `test_cases` is used to store the parameters and arrays for each test case.
   - This is done correctly using a loop that iterates `t` times.

3. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

4. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` from the `defaultdict` module to count occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
   - It calculates the required modular values `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` for each element in the array.
   - If the required pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`, it adds the count to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
   - Finally, it appends `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Check

- **Modular Arithmetic Calculation**: The calculation of `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is correct.
- **Frequency Counting**: The use of `defaultdict` to count occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs is appropriate.
- **Pair Matching**: The logic for matching pairs based on the conditions is correctly implemented.
- **Output**: The program correctly prints the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**
