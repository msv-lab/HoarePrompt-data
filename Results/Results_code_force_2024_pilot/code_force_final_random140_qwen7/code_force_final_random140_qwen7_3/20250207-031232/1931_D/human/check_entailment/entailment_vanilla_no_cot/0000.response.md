Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. The program uses a frequency dictionary to count the occurrences of each modulus pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` and then checks how many pairs satisfy the conditions for being a beautiful pair. The implementation looks sound and should work as expected for the given constraints.
