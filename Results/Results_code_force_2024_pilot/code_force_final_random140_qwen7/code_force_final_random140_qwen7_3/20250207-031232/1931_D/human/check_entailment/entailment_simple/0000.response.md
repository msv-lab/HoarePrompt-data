Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array \(a\) for each test case. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, extracting the necessary parameters \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(a\).

2. **Frequency Calculation**: For each element in the array, the program calculates its modulus with respect to \(x\) and \(y\). It then determines the required modulus values for \(x\) and \(y\) that would make a pair beautiful. Specifically, it checks if there are any previously seen elements that satisfy these conditions.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: The program uses a dictionary (`freq`) to keep track of how many times each modulus pair has been encountered. When a new modulus pair is encountered, it checks if this pair has been seen before and adds the count to the `beautiful_count`.

4. **Result Collection**: After processing all elements in the array for a test case, the program appends the `beautiful_count` to the results list.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program outputs the results for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should correctly compute the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. The provided example test cases also match the expected output.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
