Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.

2. **Data Structure Initialization**:
   - A list `test_cases` is used to store the parameters and the array for each test case.
   - This is done correctly, ensuring that each test case's data is stored separately.

3. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the number of test cases and the list of test cases.
   - The function returns a list of results, one for each test case.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the parameters and the array.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair that would make the pair beautiful.
   - If such a pair exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count to the `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
   - Finally, it appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

### Correctness Check

1. **Modulo Calculation**:
   - The modulo operations are correctly calculated for both `x` and `y`.

2. **Beautiful Pair Condition**:
   - The condition for a pair to be beautiful is correctly checked using the required modulo values.

3. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The frequency counting mechanism is correctly implemented using `defaultdict`.

4. **Result Collection**:
   - The results are collected and returned correctly.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program is correct based on the provided problem description.

**Correctness: True**
