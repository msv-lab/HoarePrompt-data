Output State: The `results` list will contain the final value of `beautiful_count` after all iterations of the loop have completed. This value represents the total count of pairs `(mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the frequency dictionary `freq` across all elements in the arrays specified by `test_cases`. All other variables such as `test_cases`, `case['array']`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
