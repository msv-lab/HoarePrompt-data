Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_y` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_y` which is the modulus of `num` divided by `y`. However, the initial value of `num` is not specified. Since `num` is not defined before this line of code, it remains undefined. All other variables retain their initial states.
