Output State: **`mod_x` remains the same, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `mod_y` remains the same, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` remains the same unless `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, in which case `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. The values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged. The value of `beautiful_count` only changes if the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the dictionary `freq`, in which case it is incremented by the corresponding value in `freq`.
