Output State: **`results` contains the final value of `beautiful_count`, which is the sum of all increments of `beautiful_count` during the loop's iterations; `a`, `x`, `y`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` retain their final values from the loop's execution.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(beautiful_count)` appends the current value of `beautiful_count` to the list `results`. This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the final value of `beautiful_count` is stored in `results`. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code, so they retain their values from the end of the loop.
