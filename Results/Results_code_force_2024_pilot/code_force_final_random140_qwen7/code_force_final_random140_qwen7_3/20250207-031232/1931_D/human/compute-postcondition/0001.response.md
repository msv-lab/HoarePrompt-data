State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `case`, which is being iterated over from `test_cases`.
2. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element because the `enumerate` function (or similar iteration) will fail if `test_cases` is empty.
3. The variable `results` is not directly involved in the loop condition; its initial state as an empty list is acceptable for the loop to start.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `test_cases` is a non-empty list so that the loop can iterate over it.
