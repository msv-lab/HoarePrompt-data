Output State: **`beautiful_count` is `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq`**

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
