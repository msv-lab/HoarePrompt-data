Postcondition: `a` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `((required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq)` is true, then `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `num`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_y`, and `beautiful_count` remain unchanged.
