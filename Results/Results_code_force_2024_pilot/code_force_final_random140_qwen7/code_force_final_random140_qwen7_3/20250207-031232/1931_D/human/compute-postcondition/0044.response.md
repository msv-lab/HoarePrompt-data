Output State: **`mod_x` remains the same, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `mod_y` remains the same**.

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This does not affect `mod_x` or `mod_y`, so they remain unchanged. The value of `required_mod_x` is determined based on the current values of `x` and `mod_x`.
