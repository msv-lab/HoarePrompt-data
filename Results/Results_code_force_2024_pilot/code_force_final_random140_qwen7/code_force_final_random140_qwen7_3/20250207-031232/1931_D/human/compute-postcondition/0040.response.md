Output State: **`n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` is a non-empty list (at least one case), `case['array']` is now equal to the empty list `[]`, `a` is now equal to the empty list `[]`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, and `freq` is an empty defaultdict.**

Explanation: The code initializes `beautiful_count` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `results`, `test_cases`, `case['array']`, `a`, and `freq` remain unchanged from their initial states.
