Output State: **`beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` or remains 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list `case['array']` without its first two elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `freq[mod_x, num % y]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_x` to `num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `mod_y` is `num % y`, and `required_mod_y` is also `num % y`. The value of `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`. The frequency count for the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` is incremented by 1.
