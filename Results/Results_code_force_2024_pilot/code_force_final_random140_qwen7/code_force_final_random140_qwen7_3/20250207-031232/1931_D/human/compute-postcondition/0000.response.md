Output State: **`results` is an empty list.**

The initial state defines that `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^4\). However, the given code snippet only initializes an empty list named `results`. No operations are performed on `t` or any other variables within the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `results` is initialized as an empty list. All other conditions and values remain as per the initial state description.
