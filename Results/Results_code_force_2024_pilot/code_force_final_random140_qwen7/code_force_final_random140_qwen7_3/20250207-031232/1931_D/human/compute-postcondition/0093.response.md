Postcondition: `a` must have at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
