Output State: **All elements in `a` have been processed, `mod_x` and `mod_y` have been updated for each element in `a`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` has been incremented for each unique pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered, and `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all pairs where `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`.**

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- Each `num` in `a` will have its modulus with `x` and `y` calculated, updating `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
- The frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair is tracked in `freq`.
- `beautiful_count` accumulates the count of previously seen `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pairs that match the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair's transformation.
