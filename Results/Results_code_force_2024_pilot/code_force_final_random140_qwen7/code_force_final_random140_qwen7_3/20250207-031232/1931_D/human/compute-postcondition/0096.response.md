Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `a` must have at least two elements.
- `num` is the second element of `a`.
- `mod_x` is `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is `num % y`.
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
- `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y]`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for num in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `num` is taken from the list `a`.
- For the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.

### Adjusting the States
- Since `num` is the next element in `a`, `num` will be the third element (if `a` has at least three elements).
- `mod_x` will be `num % x`.
- `mod_y` will be `num % y`.
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` will be incremented by 1.
- `beautiful_count` will be incremented by the value of `freq[(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y]`.

### New States
- `a` must have at least three elements (since `num` is now the third element).
- `num` will be the third element of `a`.
- `mod_x` will be `num % x`.
- `mod_y` will be `num % y`.
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` will be incremented by 1.
- `beautiful_count` will be incremented by the value of `freq[(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y]`.

### Final State
State: **`a` must have at least three elements, `num` is the third element of `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, and `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y]`**
