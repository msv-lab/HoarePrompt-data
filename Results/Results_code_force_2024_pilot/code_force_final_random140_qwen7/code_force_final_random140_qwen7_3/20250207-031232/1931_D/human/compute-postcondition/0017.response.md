Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over `num` in the list `a`. Therefore, the relevant variables in the loop head are `num` and `a`.

2. **Determine the state changes**:
   - `num` is being iterated over from the list `a`.
   - The value of `num` is taken from the list `a` during each iteration.

3. **Initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1` or remains 0.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `test_cases` is a non-empty list.
   - `case['array']` must not be empty.
   - `n` is `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is `case['array']`.
   - `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.
   - `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
   - The tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq` if and only if `beautiful_count` is updated accordingly.

4. **Adjusting the states for the next iteration**:
   - `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a list and it is non-empty, the next `num` will be the first element of `a` if `a` still contains elements.

5. **New state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `beautiful_count` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `results` remains an empty list.
   - `test_cases` remains a non-empty list.
   - `case['array']` remains the same and must not be empty.
   - `n` remains `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` remains `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` remains `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` now becomes the list without the first element (since `num` is taken from `a`).
   - `freq` remains the same.
   - `mod_x` is recalculated based on the new `num`.
   - `required_mod_y` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1` or remains 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list `case['array']` without its first element, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq` if and only if `beautiful_count` is updated accordingly.**
