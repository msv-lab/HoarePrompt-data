Output State: **`a` must have at least three elements, `num` is the third element of `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `freq[mod_x, required_mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, and `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y]**.

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` simply assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. This does not change the values of any other variables or conditions. Therefore, the only change is that `required_mod_y` now holds the same value as `mod_y`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
