Output State: **`mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` remains the same, `mod_y` remains the same, `required_mod_y` remains the same, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` remains the same unless \((required_mod_x, required_mod_y)\) is in `freq`, in which case `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `num` is the current element in the list `a`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_x` to be the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states. The frequency of the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` is incremented by 1. If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the dictionary `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is incremented by the corresponding value in `freq`. The variable `num` is also updated to the current element in the list `a`.
