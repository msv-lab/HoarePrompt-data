Output State: **`n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the frequency dictionary `freq` for each element in the original array `a`; `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`; `test_cases` is a non-empty list (at least one case); `case['array']` is now equal to the empty list `[]`; `a` is now equal to the empty list `[]`; `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `case['array']` to the variable `a`. Since `case['array']` is an empty list, `a` is also an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
