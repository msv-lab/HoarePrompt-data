Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `a` must be fully traversed, meaning every element in `a` has been processed exactly once. For each element `num` in `a`, `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`, and `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`. The variable `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair. Additionally, `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y]` for each element `num` in `a`.

In summary, `beautiful_count` will hold the total count of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` such that there exists another element in `a` whose modulus with `x` and `y` matches `(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y` respectively. The dictionary `freq` will store the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered during the iteration over `a`.
