Output State: **`results` list now contains `beautiful_count`, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(beautiful_count)` appends the current value of `beautiful_count` to the `results` list. Since `beautiful_count` was previously calculated as the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all pairs where `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`, appending it to `results` simply adds this value to the list. No other variables are affected by this line of code.
