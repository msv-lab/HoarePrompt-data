Output State: **`a` must have at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. Since `mod_x` is already defined as `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is now `(x - (num % x)) % x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
