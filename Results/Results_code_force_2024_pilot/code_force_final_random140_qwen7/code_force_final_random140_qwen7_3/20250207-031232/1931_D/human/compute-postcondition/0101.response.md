Output State: **`a` must have at least three elements, `num` is the third element of `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `freq[mod_x, required_mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y] + 1**.

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Given that `required_mod_x` is `mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[mod_x, mod_y] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
