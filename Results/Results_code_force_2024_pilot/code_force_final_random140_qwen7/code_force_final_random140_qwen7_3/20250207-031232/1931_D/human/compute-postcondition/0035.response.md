Output State: **`beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the frequency dictionary `freq` for each element in the original array `a`; `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`; `test_cases` is an empty list; `case['array']` is an empty list; `n` is `case['params'][0]`; `x` is `case['params'][1]`; `y` is `case['params'][2]`; `a` is an empty list; `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `beautiful_count` to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending `beautiful_count`, `results` now contains one element, which is `beautiful_count`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, including `test_cases`, `case['array']`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `freq`.
