Output State: `beautiful_count` is the sum of frequencies for all pairs `(mod_x, required_mod_y)` where `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x` and `required_mod_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in `a`, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` is an empty list after all iterations, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is an empty list, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `beautiful_count` will be the total count of pairs `(mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the frequency dictionary `freq` for each element in the original array `a`. The `results` list remains empty, and both `test_cases` and `a` become empty lists since all elements of `a` have been processed. The `freq` dictionary keeps track of how many times each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` appears as the loop iterates through `a`.
