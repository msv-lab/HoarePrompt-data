Output State: **`mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` remains unchanged, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `num` is the next element in the list `a`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_y` to `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Specifically, `mod_x` is still updated to `num % x`, `mod_y` is now updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` remains unchanged, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, and `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
