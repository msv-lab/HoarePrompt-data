You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a list containing three integers n, x, and y such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= x, y <= 10^9. Additionally, test_cases is a list of such triplets, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Each element a_i in the array a for each test case satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list will contain the final value of `beautiful_count` after all iterations of the loop have completed. This value represents the total count of pairs `(mod_x, required_mod_y)` found across all elements in all arrays specified in `test_cases`. All other variables such as `a`, `x`, `y`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. The `test_cases` list will also remain unchanged, as it was initialized and used within the loop but not modified outside of it.
    return results
    #The program returns the results list which contains the final value of beautiful_count after all iterations of the loop have completed. This value represents the total count of pairs (mod_x, required_mod_y) found across all elements in all arrays specified in test_cases. All other variables such as a, x, y, mod_x, mod_y, freq, and beautiful_count will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. The test_cases list will also remain unchanged, as it was initialized and used within the loop but not modified outside of it.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of triplets where each triplet consists of integers n, x, and y. For each triplet, the function processes an array a of length n, where each element a_i is between 1 and 10^9. The function calculates the total count of pairs (mod_x, required_mod_y) across all arrays specified in `test_cases` and returns a list containing this count.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the results list which contains the final value of beautiful_count after all iterations of the loop have completed. This value represents the total count of pairs (mod_x, required_mod_y) found across all elements in all arrays specified in test_cases. All other variables such as a, x, y, mod_x, mod_y, freq, and beautiful_count will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. The test_cases list will also remain unchanged, as it was initialized and used within the loop but not modified outside of it.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
