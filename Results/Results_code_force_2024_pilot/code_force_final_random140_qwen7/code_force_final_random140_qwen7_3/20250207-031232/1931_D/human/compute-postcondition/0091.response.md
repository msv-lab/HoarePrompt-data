Output State: **`a` must have at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`**

Explanation: The code `required_mod_y = mod_y` simply assigns the current value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. This does not change any other variables or conditions. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the assignment to `required_mod_y`.
