Output State: **`beautiful_count` is `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + freq[required_mod_y, required_mod_y] + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list `case['array']` without its first two elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `mod_y` is now equal to `required_mod_y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`**.

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Since `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y` is `num % y`, `beautiful_count` now includes the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` in addition to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
