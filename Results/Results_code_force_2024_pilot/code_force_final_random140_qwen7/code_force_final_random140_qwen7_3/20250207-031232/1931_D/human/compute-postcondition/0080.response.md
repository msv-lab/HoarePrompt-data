Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. Since `mod_y` is defined as `num % y`, `required_mod_y` now also holds the value of `num % y`. The other variables (`a`, `num`, `mod_y`) remain unchanged.
