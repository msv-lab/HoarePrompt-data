Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, x, y = case['params']
    a = case['array']
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    beautiful_count = 0
    for num in a:
        mod_x = num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
        required_mod_y = mod_y
        if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
            beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
    results.append(beautiful_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the frequency dictionary `freq` for each element in the original array `a`; `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`; `test_cases` is an empty list; `case['array']` is an empty list; `n` is `case['params'][0]`; `x` is `case['params'][1]`; `y` is `case['params'][2]`; `a` is an empty list; `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` list now contains `beautiful_count`, all other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` contains the final value of `beautiful_count`, which is the sum of all increments of `beautiful_count` during the loop's iterations; `a`, `x`, `y`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` retain their final values from the loop's execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
