Output State: **`mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is now equal to `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `num` is the current element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The values of `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `beautiful_count` is updated based on the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.
