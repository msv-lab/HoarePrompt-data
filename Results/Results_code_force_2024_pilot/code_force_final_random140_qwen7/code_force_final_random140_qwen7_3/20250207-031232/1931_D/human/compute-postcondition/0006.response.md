Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for num in a:`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `num`: This variable will take on the value of each element in the list `a` during each iteration.
   - `a`: This is the list that contains the elements to be iterated over.

3. **Check the provided initial state**:
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `test_cases` is a non-empty list.
   - `n` is `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is `case['array']`.
   - `freq` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over the list `a`, the only relevant variable from the loop head is `num`, which will take on the values of the elements in `a`.
   - The list `a` itself must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `num` will take on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: `a` must contain at least one element, num is the first element of the list `a`**
