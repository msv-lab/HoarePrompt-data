Output State: `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` for every `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the array `a` during the loop's execution, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` is an empty list after all iterations, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is an empty list, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `beautiful_count` will hold the total count of numbers in the original array that satisfy the condition based on the given `x` and `y`. The `freq` dictionary will store the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the array, and all other variables will be in their final states as described.
