Output State: **`mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` remains the same, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` remains the same unless `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, in which case `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]`, `num` is the current element in the list `a`**.

This means that:
- `mod_x` is now the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `required_mod_x` is now the remainder when `x - mod_x` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is now the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_y` remains unchanged.
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
- `beautiful_count` is unchanged unless `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is already a key in `freq`, in which case `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.
- `num` remains the current element in the list `a`.
