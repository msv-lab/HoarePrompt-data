Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1` or remains 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq` if and only if `beautiful_count` is updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` or remains 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list `case['array']` without its first element, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + freq[required_mod_y, required_mod_y] + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` or remains 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list `case['array']` without its first two elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `mod_y` is now equal to `required_mod_y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is now `freq[mod_x, mod_y] + 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
