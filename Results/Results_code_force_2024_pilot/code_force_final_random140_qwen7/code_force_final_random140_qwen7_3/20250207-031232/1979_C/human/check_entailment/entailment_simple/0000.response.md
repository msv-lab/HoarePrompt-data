Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The annotated program attempts to solve this by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the multipliers and using it to scale down the bets.

2. **Key Steps in the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k`).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`).
   - It computes the scaled-down bets (`c`) by dividing `m` by each multiplier `k[i]`.
   - It uses a helper function `func_1` to compute the GCD of the scaled-down bets.
   - It scales down the bets further by dividing each by the GCD.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the scaled-down bets is less than or equal to the product `m`. If so, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution; otherwise, it prints the scaled-down bets.

3. **Helper Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - It iterates through the list, updating the GCD with each element.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the main program is sound. It correctly calculates the scaled-down bets and checks if they meet the condition.
   - The use of the GCD ensures that the bets are scaled down to the smallest possible values while maintaining their relative proportions.
   - The final check ensures that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the product `m`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
