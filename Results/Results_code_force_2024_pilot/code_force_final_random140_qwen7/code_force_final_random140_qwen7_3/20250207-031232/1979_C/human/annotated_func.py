#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `hcf` is equal to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `hcf` and all elements in the list `numbers`; `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `hcf` will contain the greatest common divisor of all the elements in the list `numbers`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `hcf` to be the gcd of `hcf` and each subsequent element in the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the integers in the list. Given a list of integers, the function iterates through each element, updating the greatest common divisor found so far until it has processed all elements in the list. The final result is the gcd of all integers in the list.
