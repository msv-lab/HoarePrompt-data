Output State: **The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list 'numbers'**

This means that after the loop has executed, the variable `hcf` holds the greatest common divisor of all the integers present in the list `numbers`. The function `return hcf` will thus return this calculated gcd value.
