Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - **ele**: This variable takes on the value of the current element in the list `l` during each iteration.
   - **l**: The list `l` remains the same throughout the loop, but its elements are consumed one by one.

4. **Postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `l` is a list with at least one element.
   - If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0.
   - Otherwise, `c` is increased by the first element of `l`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `l` is a list and its elements are being consumed, the first element of `l` is no longer available for the next iteration.
   - `ele` will take on the value of the next element in the list `l`.
   - `c` will be reset to 0 if the condition was met in the previous iteration, otherwise it will be increased by the first element of the remaining list.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `l` will still be a list with at least one element (since it had at least one element initially and we are consuming one element per iteration).
- `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`.
- `c` will be reset to 0 if the condition was met in the previous iteration, otherwise it will be increased by the first element of the remaining list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `ele` is the next element in the list, `c` is 0**.
