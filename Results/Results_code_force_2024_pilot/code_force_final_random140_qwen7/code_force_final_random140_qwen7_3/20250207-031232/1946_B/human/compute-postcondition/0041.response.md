Output State: **`c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele` and has been incremented by `ele`, `l` has at least one element**.

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by `ele`. Since `ele` is a non-negative number, `c` remains greater than the absolute value of `ele`. The list `l` and the variable `ele` remain unchanged from their initial states.
