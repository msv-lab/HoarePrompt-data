Output State: **`c` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` (which is now 0) and `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` (which is now 0) and `maxi`.**

In this output state, the variable `c` is explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their previous states, with `i` being incremented by 1, `n` and `k` remaining as input integers, `l` as a list of integers, `maxi` updated to be the maximum of its current value and 0, and `ele` as the next element in the list `l`.
