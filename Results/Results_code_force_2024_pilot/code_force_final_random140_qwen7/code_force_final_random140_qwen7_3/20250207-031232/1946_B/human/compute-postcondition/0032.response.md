Output State: **`c` is 0, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `n` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, `i` is `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `c` to 0. This means that `c` now holds the value 0, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
