Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
