Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`, where `maxi` is the maximum value between the cumulative sum `c` and the previous `maxi` whenever a negative element with an absolute value greater than or equal to `c` is encountered, and `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`. This computation is performed independently for each test case, and the results are printed for each test case after all iterations of the loop have completed.

In simpler terms, after running through all the iterations of the loop, the output will be the computed value of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` for each test case, where `maxi` is the highest value of `c` (cumulative sum) or `maxi` encountered during the processing of the list `l`, and `sum(l)` is the total sum of all elements in the list `l`.
