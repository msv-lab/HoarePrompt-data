Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Understand the input process**: The expression `int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and converts it to an integer. This integer represents the number of iterations the loop will perform.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as the value read from `input()` is a non-negative integer. Since the problem guarantees that the input is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the loop will always execute at least once.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state of the object that controls the loop's execution, which is the integer read from `input()`. We also need to ensure that `i` starts at 0.

**State before the loop starts**:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 0 (since it is initialized to 0 in the loop).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the integer read from `input()`, which is `t`.

**State after adjustment**:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 0.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
