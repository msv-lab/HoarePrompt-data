You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The array a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the array.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        c = 0
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for ele in l:
            if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
                c = 0
            else:
                c += ele
        
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will have `maxi` as the maximum value between the cumulative sum of non-negative elements in the array `l` and the maximum value of `c` (which is the sum of elements until a negative element is encountered with an absolute value greater than or equal to `c`) for each iteration. The variable `c` will hold the sum of all non-negative elements in the array `l` after processing all elements. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final `maxi` for each test case will be printed as `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`. This calculation is performed for each test case, and the result is printed after all iterations of the loop are completed.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `maxi` will be the highest value obtained from either the sum of non-negative elements or the special condition involving negative elements, and `c` will be the total sum of all non-negative elements in the array `l`. The final output for each test case will be calculated using the formula provided and printed modulo \(1000000007\).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t, and for each t, there are two positive integers n and k, and an array a of n integers. The function returns a result based on the given inputs for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
