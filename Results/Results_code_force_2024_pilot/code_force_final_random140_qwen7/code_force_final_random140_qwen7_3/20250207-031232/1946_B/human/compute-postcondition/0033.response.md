Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `i` is `k + 1`**

Explanation: The line `maxi = 0` sets the value of `maxi` to 0. The initial value of `c` is 0, which does not affect the value of `maxi` since `max(0, 0)` is 0. The value of `i` is set to `k + 1`, which is unchanged from its initial state. The lists and other variables remain unaffected.
