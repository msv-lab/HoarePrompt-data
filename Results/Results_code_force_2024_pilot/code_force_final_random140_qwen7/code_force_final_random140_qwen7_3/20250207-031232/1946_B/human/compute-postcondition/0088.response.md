To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `c`: This is the sum of all elements in the list `l` that are greater than or equal to 0, or 0 if there are no such elements.
   - `i`: This is calculated as `i_prev + len(l)`. Since `i_prev` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it is an undefined or irrelevant value for this calculation.
   - `maxi`: This is the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial `maxi`. Since `maxi` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it is an undefined or irrelevant value for this calculation.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet to be executed is: `print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)`

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `c` is the sum of all elements in `l` that are greater than or equal to 0, or 0 if there are no such elements, `c` will be a non-negative integer.
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the initial `maxi`. If `maxi` was not defined initially, it could be any value, but for the purpose of the calculation, we consider the maximum value between `c` and 0 (since `c` is non-negative).
   - `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

Given these points, the expression inside the `print` function simplifies to:
\[ \text{Result} = (2^k \cdot \max(c, \text{initial } \maxi) - \max(c, \text{initial } \maxi) + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007 \]

Since `maxi` is either `c` or 0 (if `c` is 0), the expression further simplifies to:
\[ \text{Result} = (2^k \cdot c - c + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007 \]
or
\[ \text{Result} = (2^k \cdot 0 - 0 + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007 \]
which simplifies to:
\[ \text{Result} = (\text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007 \]

Therefore, the output will be the sum of all elements in the list `l` modulo 1000000007.

Output: **(\text{sum}(l) \mod 1000000007)**
