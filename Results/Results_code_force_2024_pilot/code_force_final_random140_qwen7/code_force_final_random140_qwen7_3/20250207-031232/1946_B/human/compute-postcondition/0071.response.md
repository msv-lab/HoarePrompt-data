Postcondition: `c` is an integer, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `ele` is an element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `0 + ele`.
