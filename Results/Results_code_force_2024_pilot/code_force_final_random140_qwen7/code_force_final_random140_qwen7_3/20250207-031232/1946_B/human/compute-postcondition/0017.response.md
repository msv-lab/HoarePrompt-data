Output State: **`l` is a list with at least one element; `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`; `c` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is assigned the value 0. The list `l` and the variable `maxi` retain their previous states. The value of `maxi` remains as the maximum value between `c` (which was previously defined) and the previous value of `maxi`.
