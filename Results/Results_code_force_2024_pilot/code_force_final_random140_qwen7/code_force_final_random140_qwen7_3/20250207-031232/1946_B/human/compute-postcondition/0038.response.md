Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is explicitly set to 0. The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `c`, which is now 0. Therefore, `maxi` will be 0 if its current value is less than or equal to 0, otherwise, it remains unchanged.
