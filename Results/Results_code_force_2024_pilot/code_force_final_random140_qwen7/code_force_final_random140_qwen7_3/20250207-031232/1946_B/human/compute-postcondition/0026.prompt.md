Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `l` is a list with at least one element. If there exists an element `ele` in `l` such that `ele` is less than 0 and the current count `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele` plus `ele`, and `maxi` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `l` is a list with at least one element. If the element `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the first element of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is a list with at least one element, `ele` is the next element in the list, and `c` is the sum of the original value of `c` (which is 0) and `ele`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to the sum of the original value of `c` and `ele`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
