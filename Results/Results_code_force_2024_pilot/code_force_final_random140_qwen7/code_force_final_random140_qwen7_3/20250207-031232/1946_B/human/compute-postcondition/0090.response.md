Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will have `maxi` as the maximum value between the cumulative sum of non-negative elements in the array `l` and the maximum value of `c` (which is the sum of elements until a negative element is encountered with an absolute value greater than or equal to `c`) for each iteration. The variable `c` will hold the sum of all non-negative elements in the array `l` after processing all elements. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final `maxi` for each test case will be printed as `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`. This calculation is performed for each test case, and the result is printed after all iterations of the loop are completed.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `maxi` will be the highest value obtained from either the sum of non-negative elements or the special condition involving negative elements, and `c` will be the total sum of all non-negative elements in the array `l`. The final output for each test case will be calculated using the formula provided and printed modulo \(1000000007\).
