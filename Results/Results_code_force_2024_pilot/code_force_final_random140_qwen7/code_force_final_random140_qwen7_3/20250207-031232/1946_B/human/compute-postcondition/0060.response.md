Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them based on whitespace, and converts them to integers. It then assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `i` is not affected by this operation and retains its previous value, which is `i_prev + 1`.
