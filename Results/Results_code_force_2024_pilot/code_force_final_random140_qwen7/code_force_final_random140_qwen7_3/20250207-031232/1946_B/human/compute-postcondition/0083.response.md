Postcondition: `c` is updated based on the condition, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` (which is now 0) and `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value, and `maxi` remains the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
