To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression in the `print` statement step by step.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`.
   - `c` is the sum of all elements in `l` after processing each element according to the given conditions.

2. **Expression in the Print Statement**:
   \[
   (2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007
   \]

Given the initial state, we need to understand the values of `maxi` and `c`:

- `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l` after processing each element according to the given conditions.

Since the exact list `l` and the value of `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `maxi` and `c`. However, we can express the final printed value in terms of these variables.

The expression simplifies to:
\[
(2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007
\]

Therefore, the output will be the result of this expression modulo \(1000000007\).

Output: **(2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007**
