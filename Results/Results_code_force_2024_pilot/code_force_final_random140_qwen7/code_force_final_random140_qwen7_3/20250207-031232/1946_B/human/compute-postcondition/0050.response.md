Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `l` is a list with at least one element.
   - `ele` is -3.
   - `c` is 3.
   - `maxi` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition given, if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to 3.

4. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `ele` is -3.
   - `c` is 3 (since -3 is less than 0 and the absolute value of -3 is 3, which is equal to `c`, so `c` remains 3).

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `ele` from the list `l` must be considered. Since `l` is a list with at least one element, there must be another element in the list.

6. **Adjusting States**: The only variables in the loop head are `ele` and the current element being processed. Therefore, we need to adjust `ele` to the next element in the list `l`.

7. **New State**: After the next iteration starts, `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`. The values of `c` and `maxi` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `ele` is the next element in the list, `c` is 3, and `maxi` is 0**.
