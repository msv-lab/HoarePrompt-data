### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The key insight is that we can always choose to insert the sum of the entire array multiple times, which can significantly increase the sum.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array elements.
   - The variable `maxi` is used to keep track of the maximum positive prefix sum encountered.
   - The variable `c` is used to accumulate the sum of negative elements until a larger positive element is encountered.
   - Finally, it calculates the result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for calculating `maxi` is flawed. The code only considers the maximum positive prefix sum but does not account for the entire array's sum.
   - The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is incorrect. This formula suggests that the maximum sum can be achieved by inserting the sum of the entire array `k` times, which is not always true.
   - The correct approach should consider the sum of the entire array and the effect of inserting the sum multiple times.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct solution should directly calculate the sum of the array and then use the formula `(2 ** k * sum(l) - sum(l)) % 1000000007` to account for the effect of inserting the sum `k` times.
   - The term `- sum(l)` accounts for the fact that the initial sum is subtracted before applying the modulo operation.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect due to the flawed logic for calculating `maxi` and the incorrect formula used. The correct formula should be `(2 ** k * sum(l) - sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

**Correctness: False**
