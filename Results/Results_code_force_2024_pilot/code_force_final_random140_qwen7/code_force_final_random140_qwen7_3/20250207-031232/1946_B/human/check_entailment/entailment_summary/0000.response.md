Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations, where each operation allows inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array. The solution uses a specific formula to achieve this.

2. **Key Points in the Solution**:
   - The formula used is \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \sum(\text{array})) \mod 1000000007\).
   - `maxi` is defined as the maximum value between the cumulative sum of non-negative elements and a special condition involving negative elements.
   - This approach leverages the fact that inserting the sum of the entire array `k` times can significantly increase the array's sum.

3. **Verification of the Formula**:
   - If we insert the sum of the entire array `k` times, the new sum would be the original sum plus `k` times the sum of the array.
   - However, the formula adjusts this by subtracting `maxi` once, which accounts for the initial state before any operations.
   - The term \(2^k \times \text{maxi}\) ensures that the maximum possible contribution from the cumulative sums is considered.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The solution correctly handles edge cases like all negative elements or all zeros, ensuring the sum is calculated appropriately.
   - It also correctly applies the modulo operation to handle large numbers.

5. **Execution Summary**:
   - The provided execution summary aligns with the logic and formula used in the solution.
   - The solution iterates through each test case, calculates `maxi`, and applies the formula to compute the result.

Given the above points, the solution appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
