Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `maxi`:**
   - The variable `maxi` is intended to store the maximum positive sum of contiguous subarrays. However, the current logic only checks for negative elements and does not properly calculate the maximum sum of contiguous subarrays.
   - The logic inside the loop should accumulate the sum of the array elements while keeping track of the maximum sum encountered so far.

2. **Incorrect Formula:**
   - The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is not derived correctly from the problem statement.
   - The idea of inserting sums of subarrays multiple times can lead to a significant increase in the array's total sum, but the current implementation does not reflect this logic accurately.

### Correct Approach:

To maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial sum of the array.
2. Identify the largest positive element in the array, as adding the sum of the array multiple times can significantly increase the sum.
3. Use the formula to calculate the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the initial sum of the array
        initial_sum = sum(arr)
        
        # Find the maximum element in the array
        max_element = max(arr)
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations
        max_sum = (2 ** k * max_element - max_element + initial_sum) % MOD
        
        print(max_sum)

func()
```

This approach ensures that you correctly identify the maximum sum achievable by leveraging the properties of the array and the operations allowed.
