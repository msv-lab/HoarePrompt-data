### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves performing up to `k` operations on an array `a` of length `n`, where each operation allows inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after these operations.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight is that the optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the sum of the entire array into the array as many times as possible within `k` operations. This is because adding the sum of the array multiple times will significantly increase the overall sum.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over each test case.
   - It calculates the sum of the array (`sum(l)`).
   - It finds the maximum value between the cumulative sum of non-negative elements (`maxi`) and the maximum value of `c` (which is the sum of elements until a negative element is encountered with an absolute value greater than or equal to `c`).
   - Finally, it prints the result of the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

4. **Formula Explanation**:
   - `2 ** k * maxi`: This part of the formula represents the sum contributed by the `k` operations, where `maxi` is the maximum value found.
   - `- maxi`: This term subtracts the initial `maxi` value to avoid double-counting.
   - `+ sum(l)`: This adds the original sum of the array.
   - `% 1000000007`: This ensures the result fits within the required modulo.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements are negative, the sum of the array will be negative, but the formula will still work correctly.
   - If the array contains both positive and negative elements, the formula will handle the maximum value correctly.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - The formula used is correct and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem and produces the expected results based on the provided examples.
