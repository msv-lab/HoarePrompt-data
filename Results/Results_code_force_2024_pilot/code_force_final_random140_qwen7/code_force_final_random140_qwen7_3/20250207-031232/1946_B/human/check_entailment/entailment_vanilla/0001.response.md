### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation allows us to insert the sum of any contiguous subarray anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after these operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert the sum of the entire array into the array until we have performed `k` operations.
   - This is because inserting the sum of the entire array maximally increases the total sum with each operation.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of the array.
   - The variable `maxi` is intended to store the maximum value in the array, but the logic used to update `maxi` is incorrect.

4. **Detailed Breakdown:**
   - The loop iterates through each element of the array and checks if the current element is negative and its absolute value is less than or equal to `c`. If so, it updates `maxi` and resets `c`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the current element to `c`.
   - Finally, it prints the result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

5. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic to find the maximum value in the array is incorrect. It should simply find the maximum value without the unnecessary conditions.
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect. It should be `(2 ** k * sum(l) - sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        maxi = max(l)
        print(((2 ** k * sum(l) - sum(l)) % 1000000007))
```

### Conclusion:
The given code has logical errors and uses an incorrect approach to solve the problem. The corrected code above should be used instead.

**Correctness:** **False**
