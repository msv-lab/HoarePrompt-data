You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `remaining_players` will be a list where each element `remaining_players[n]` is calculated as follows: For each `n` from 1 to `max_n`, the variable `cur_n` starts with the value of `n` and repeatedly decreases by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` until `cur_n` is less than `min(p)`. The final value of `cur_n` is assigned to `remaining_players[n]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `remaining_players` will contain the final value of `cur_n` for each `n` from 1 to `max_n`, which represents how much `n` would decrease by following the described process until it falls below the minimum value in `p`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers `p` where each integer is between 1 and 100, and returns a list `remaining_players`. Each element `remaining_players[n]` in the returned list is the final value of `cur_n` after it has been repeatedly decreased by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`, until `cur_n` is less than the minimum value in `p` for each `n` from 1 to the maximum value in `p`.

    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `k` and `q` will hold the values from the last set of inputs provided, `p` and `qs` will contain the last lists of integers, `remaining_players` will be the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, `res` will be the list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by `qs`, and `results` will be a list of strings, each representing the `res` list from each iteration, joined by spaces. The variable `t` will be 0 as all iterations have been completed.

    #The program returns a string that is a space-separated list of string representations of the `res` list from each iteration, where `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`. The last set of inputs provided resulted in `k` being an integer, `q` being an integer, `p` being a list of integers, `qs` being a list of integers, `remaining_players` being the result of `func_1(p)`, and `res` being a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by `qs`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple sets of inputs, each consisting of integers k, q, a list p of k integers, and a list qs of q integers. For each set, it calls another function `func_1` to get the remaining players based on the list p, then extracts specific players indicated by qs. It collects these extracted lists into a results list, converts each list to a space-separated string, and finally returns a single string containing all these results concatenated together.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the number of players who remain in the game after several rounds.
   - In each round, players at positions `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` are removed from the game, where `a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k`.
   - The process continues until no more players can be removed in a round.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function calculates the number of players remaining for each initial number of players from 1 to 100.
     - It iterates over each possible initial number of players (`n`) and simulates the removal process.
     - For each `n`, it keeps removing players at positions specified by `p` until no more players can be removed.
     - The result is stored in `remaining_players`, which is an array where `remaining_players[n]` gives the number of players remaining if `n` players start the game.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_1` to precompute the number of remaining players for each initial number of players from 1 to 100.
     - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`.
     - For each `n` in `qs`, it retrieves the corresponding value from `remaining_players` and appends it to the result list.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the removal process for each initial number of players.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly uses the precomputed results to answer each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the maximum limit of players (100) correctly.
   - It correctly skips positions where there are fewer players than required.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It precomputes the number of remaining players for each initial number of players and uses these precomputed values to answer each test case efficiently.

### Correctness:
**True**
