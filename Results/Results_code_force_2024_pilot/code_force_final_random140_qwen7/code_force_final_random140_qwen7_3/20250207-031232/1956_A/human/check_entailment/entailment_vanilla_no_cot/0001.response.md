### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the game where players are removed based on positions specified by the sequence `p`.
   - For each initial number of players `n_i`, we need to determine how many players remain until no more players can be removed.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of remaining players for all possible initial counts from 1 to 100.
   - It uses a while loop to iteratively remove players according to the positions specified by `p`.
   - `bisect.bisect_right` is used to find the position of the current player in the sorted sequence `p`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` to precompute the remaining players for all initial counts from 1 to 100.
   - It then uses the precomputed results to answer the specific queries for each test case.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the removal of players based on the sequence `p`.
   - The precomputation in `func_1` ensures that for any `n_i`, the result can be quickly retrieved.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes the input and outputs the results.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where the number of players `n` is less than the smallest position in `p` by skipping those positions.
   - The function correctly handles the case where no players are removed in a round.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions appear to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
