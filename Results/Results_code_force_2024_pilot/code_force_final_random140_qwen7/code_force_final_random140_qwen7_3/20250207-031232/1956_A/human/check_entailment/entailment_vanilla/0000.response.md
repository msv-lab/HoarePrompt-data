Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate a game where players are removed based on positions specified by the sequence `p`.
   - For each initial number of players `n`, we need to determine how many players remain at the end of the game.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to precompute the number of remaining players for all possible initial numbers of players from 1 to 100.
   - It iterates through each possible initial number of players `n` and removes players according to the sequence `p`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the input and uses the precomputed results from `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the sequence `p`, the number of queries `q`, and the query values `qs`.
   - It uses the precomputed results to determine the number of remaining players for each query value `n` and stores these results in a list.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Precomputation (`func_1`):**
   - The function correctly initializes an array `remaining_players` to store the number of remaining players for each initial number of players from 1 to 100.
   - The loop iterates through each possible initial number of players `n`.
   - For each `n`, it uses a while loop to remove players based on the sequence `p`. The `bisect.bisect_right` function is used to find the position in `p` where `cur_n` would fit, effectively determining how many players need to be removed.
   - The logic inside the while loop is correct for removing players based on the sequence `p`.

2. **Query Processing (`func_2`):**
   - The function correctly reads the input and uses the precomputed results to determine the number of remaining players for each query.
   - The results are stored in a list and returned as required.

### Edge Cases and Validation

- **Edge Case 1:** When `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`, no players will be removed, and `n` itself will be the number of remaining players.
- **Edge Case 2:** When `n` is exactly equal to the largest element in `p`, the last player will be removed, leaving `n - 1` players.
- **Edge Case 3:** When `n` is between elements in `p`, the number of remaining players can be determined by the difference between `n` and the next element in `p`.

Given that the logic in both functions appears to handle these edge cases correctly and the overall approach is sound, the program should work as intended.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
