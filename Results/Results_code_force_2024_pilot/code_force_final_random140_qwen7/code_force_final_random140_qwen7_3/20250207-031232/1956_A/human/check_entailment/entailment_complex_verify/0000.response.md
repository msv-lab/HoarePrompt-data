### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` aims to determine how many players remain after each round of the game for all possible initial numbers of players from 1 to 100.
- The logic inside the `while` loop is intended to simulate the removal of players based on the sequence `p`. However, the implementation has a flaw:
  - The `while` loop continues as long as `cur_n` is greater than or equal to `min(p)`.
  - Inside the loop, `count` is calculated using `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)`, which gives the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`.
  - `cur_n` is then decreased by this count.
  - This logic is problematic because it does not correctly handle the scenario where `cur_n` is less than `min(p)` before the loop starts, or when `cur_n` is less than `min(p)` during the loop execution.

#### Example to Show Incorrectness:
- Consider the sequence `p = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`.
  - Initially, the players are A, B, C, D, E.
  - In the first round, the 3rd and 5th players are supposed to be removed. Since there are only 5 players, the 5th player is not present, so only the 3rd player (C) is removed.
  - After removing the 3rd player, the remaining players are A, B, D, E.
  - In the second round, the 3rd player (D) is removed, and the 5th player is not present, so no one is removed.
  - Therefore, the final remaining players are A and B, making 2 winners.
- However, the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate this process. It will incorrectly calculate the number of remaining players after each round, leading to an incorrect result.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the logic in `func_1`. The function does not accurately simulate the game's rules, especially when the sequence `p` exceeds the current number of players `cur_n`.
- The provided example demonstrates that the function does not produce the correct number of remaining players for the given sequence and initial number of players.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in the game for all potential cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1`, which does not accurately simulate the game's rules.
