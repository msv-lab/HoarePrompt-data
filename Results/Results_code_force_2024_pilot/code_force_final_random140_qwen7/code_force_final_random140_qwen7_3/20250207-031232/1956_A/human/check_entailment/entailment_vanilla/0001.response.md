### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the number of players who remain in the game after several rounds.
   - In each round, players at positions `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` are removed from the game, where `a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k`.
   - The process continues until no more players can be removed in a round.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function calculates the number of players remaining for each initial number of players from 1 to 100.
     - It iterates over each possible initial number of players (`n`) and simulates the removal process.
     - For each `n`, it keeps removing players at positions specified by `p` until no more players can be removed.
     - The result is stored in `remaining_players`, which is an array where `remaining_players[n]` gives the number of players remaining if `n` players start the game.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_1` to precompute the number of remaining players for each initial number of players from 1 to 100.
     - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`.
     - For each `n` in `qs`, it retrieves the corresponding value from `remaining_players` and appends it to the result list.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the removal process for each initial number of players.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly uses the precomputed results to answer each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the maximum limit of players (100) correctly.
   - It correctly skips positions where there are fewer players than required.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It precomputes the number of remaining players for each initial number of players and uses these precomputed values to answer each test case efficiently.

### Correctness:
**True**
