Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of players who remain in the game after a series of rounds where players at specific positions are removed. The solution uses a function `func_1` to precompute the state of the game for all possible initial numbers of players (from 1 to 100), and another function `func_2` to use these precomputed results to answer queries efficiently.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates how many players remain in the game for each initial number of players from 1 to 100.
   - It iterates over each possible initial number of players (`n`) and repeatedly subtracts the count of players that need to be removed (based on the positions specified by `p`).
   - The logic correctly implements the described process, ensuring that the remaining players are accurately computed for each initial number of players.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the necessary inputs for each test case, including the sequence `p`, the number of queries `q`, and the query values `qs`.
   - It then uses the precomputed results from `func_1` to determine the number of players remaining for each query value.
   - The logic correctly maps each query value to the corresponding result from the precomputed list and formats the output as required.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles the precomputation step and the query answering step.
   - The use of `bisect.bisect_right` in `func_1` ensures efficient counting of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`.
   - The final output format matches the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
