Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a sorted list `p` and returns a list `remaining_players` where each element `remaining_players[n]` represents the number of players remaining after the described process for each initial number of players `n` from 1 to 100.
   - The process involves repeatedly decreasing `cur_n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` until `cur_n` is less than the minimum value in `p`.
   - This function correctly simulates the process described in the problem statement for each `n` from 1 to 100.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1` to get the `remaining_players` list for the given `p`.
   - It uses `remaining_players` to determine the number of players remaining for each initial number of players specified in `qs`.
   - Finally, it formats the results and appends them to the `results` list.
   - The function correctly processes each test case and combines the results into a single string.

Given the descriptions and the logic implemented in both functions, they correctly follow the problem statement and handle the inputs as expected.

Correctness: **True**
