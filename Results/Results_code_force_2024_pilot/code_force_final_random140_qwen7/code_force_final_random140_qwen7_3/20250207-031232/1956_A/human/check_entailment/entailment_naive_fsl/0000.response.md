Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in the game. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not accurately simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to simulate the game by iterating through each possible number of players `n` from 1 to 100 and determining how many players remain after each round.
   - However, the logic inside the `while` loop is flawed. It subtracts the count of players to be removed (`count`) from `cur_n`, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the sequence `p` exceeds the current number of players `cur_n`.

2. **Example to Show Incorrectness:**
   - Consider the sequence `p = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`.
     - In the first round, the 3rd and 5th players are supposed to be removed. However, since there are only 5 players, the 5th player is not present, so only the 3rd player (C) is removed.
     - After removing the 3rd player, the remaining players are A, B, D, E.
     - In the second round, the 3rd player (D) is removed, and the 5th player is not present, so no one is removed.
     - Therefore, the final remaining players are A and B, making 2 winners.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate this process. It will incorrectly calculate the number of remaining players after each round, leading to an incorrect result.

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in the game for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
