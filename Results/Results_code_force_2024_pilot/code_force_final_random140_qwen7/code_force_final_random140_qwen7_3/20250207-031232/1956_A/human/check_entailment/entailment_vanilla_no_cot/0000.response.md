To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and implementation of the functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Analysis of `func_1`

The function `func_1` aims to precompute the number of players remaining after each round for all possible initial numbers of players from 1 to 100. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: An array `remaining_players` of size 101 (from 0 to 100) is initialized to store the number of players remaining for each initial number of players.
2. **Loop through each possible initial number of players**:
   - For each `n` from 1 to 100, initialize `cur_n` to `n`.
   - Use a `while` loop to simulate the rounds:
     - Find the position `count` where `cur_n` would be placed in the sorted list `p` using `bisect.bisect_right`.
     - Subtract `count` from `cur_n`.
   - Store the final value of `cur_n` in `remaining_players[n]`.

This function seems to correctly simulate the process of kicking out players based on the positions specified in `p`.

### Analysis of `func_2`

The function `func_2` reads input and uses `func_1` to compute the results for each test case:

1. **Read Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `k`, `q`, and the sequence `p`.
   - Read the sequence of initial player counts `qs`.
2. **Compute Results**:
   - Call `func_1` to get the precomputed results.
   - Use list comprehension to find the number of remaining players for each `n` in `qs`.
   - Append the results to `results`.

### Testing and Validation

To validate the correctness of the program, we can compare its output with expected outputs for the provided examples.

#### Example Test Case

Given:
- `t = 1`
- `k = 2`, `q = 1`
- `p = [3, 5]`
- `qs = [5]`

Expected Output:
- `2`

Let's run the program and check the output.

```python
import bisect

# Function 1
def func_1(p):
    max_n = 100
    remaining_players = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        cur_n = n
        while cur_n >= min(p):
            count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)
            cur_n -= count
        remaining_players[n] = cur_n
    return remaining_players

# Function 2
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        remaining_players = func_1(p)
        res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))
    return results

print(func_2())
```

### Expected Output

For the given example:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2 1
  3 5
  5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

Running the program should produce the expected output.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and the expected behavior, the provided program appears to be correct. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**True**
