Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `p` where each integer is between 1 and 100, and returns a list `remaining_players`. Each element `remaining_players[n]` in the returned list is the final value of `cur_n` after it has been repeatedly decreased by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`, until `cur_n` is less than the minimum value in `p` for each `n` from 1 to the maximum value in `p`.**
