Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head is `while cur_n >= min(p):`. This means the loop condition depends on the variables `cur_n` and `min(p)`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `remaining_players[cur_n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\)
   - `cur_n` is \(k + 1 - \text{count}\)
   - `count` is the index of the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`

3. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop continues as long as `cur_n` is greater than or equal to `min(p)`.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to continue, `cur_n` must still be greater than or equal to `min(p)` at the start of the next iteration.
   - We cannot directly change `min(p)` because it is determined by the list `p` and is not modified within the loop body (as per the given information).

5. **Adjusting `cur_n`:**
   - Since `cur_n` is defined as \(k + 1 - \text{count}\), we need to ensure that `cur_n` remains greater than or equal to `min(p)` after the next decrement or modification (if any).
   - Given that `count` is an index and typically decreases or stays the same in such loops, we need to ensure that `cur_n` does not drop below `min(p)`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to guarantee that `cur_n` is still greater than or equal to `min(p)` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust `cur_n` to ensure this condition holds.

### Final Answer:
State: **`remaining_players[cur_n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\), `cur_n` is \(k + 1 - \text{count}\) and must be greater than or equal to `min(p)`, and `count` is the index of the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`**.
