Output State: **remaining_players is a list where each element remaining_players[n] is the final value of cur_n after it has been repeatedly decreased by the count of elements in p that are less than or equal to cur_n, until cur_n is less than the minimum value in p for each n from 1 to max_n.**

This means that for each index `n` from 1 to `max_n`, the value of `remaining_players[n]` is determined by starting with `cur_n = n` and repeatedly subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` until `cur_n` becomes less than the smallest element in the list `p`. The final value of `cur_n` after this process is assigned to `remaining_players[n]`.
