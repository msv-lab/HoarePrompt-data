Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the first split, `q` is an integer input from the second split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split**.

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and assigns the resulting list to `p`. The values of `k` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state.
