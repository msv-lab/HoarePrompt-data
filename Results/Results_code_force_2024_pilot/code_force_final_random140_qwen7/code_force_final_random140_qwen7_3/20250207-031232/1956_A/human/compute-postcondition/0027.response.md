Functionality: **The function processes multiple sets of inputs, each consisting of integers k, q, a list p of k integers, and a list qs of q integers. For each set, it calls another function `func_1` to get the remaining players based on the list p, then extracts specific players indicated by qs. It collects these extracted lists into a results list, converts each list to a space-separated string, and finally returns a single string containing all these results concatenated together.**
