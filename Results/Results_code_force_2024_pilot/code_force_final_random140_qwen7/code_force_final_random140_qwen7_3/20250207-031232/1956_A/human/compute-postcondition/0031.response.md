Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `n` and `max_n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `n` in the range from 1 to `max_n + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `remaining_players[n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\), where \(\text{count}\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`.

4. **Analyze the loop increment**:
   - The loop increments `n` by 1 each time it iterates.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` was some value, say \(k\).
   - For the next iteration, `n` will be \(k + 1\).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` should be less than or equal to `max_n`.

Given these points, let's assume the following at the end of the previous iteration:
- Let's say `n` was \(k\) and `max_n` is some value \(m\).

For the next iteration:
- `n` will be \(k + 1\).
- To ensure the loop continues, \(k + 1\) must be less than or equal to \(m\).

Since the exact values of `n` and `max_n` are not provided, we can generalize the state as follows:

**State:**
- `remaining_players[n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\), where \(\text{count}\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`.
- `n` is \(k + 1\).
- `max_n` remains the same.

To be precise, if `n` was \(k\) at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration:
- `n` will be \(k + 1\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`remaining_players[n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\), where \(\text{count}\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`, `n` is \(k + 1\), and `max_n` remains the same.**

If we denote the initial value of `n` as \(k\), the final answer would be:

State: **`remaining_players[n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\), where \(\text{count}\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`, `n` is \(k + 1\), and `max_n` remains the same.**
