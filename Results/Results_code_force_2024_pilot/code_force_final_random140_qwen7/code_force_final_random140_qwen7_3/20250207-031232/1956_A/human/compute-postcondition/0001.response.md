Output State: **`k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100; `p` is a list of k positive integers in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < k; `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < q; `t` is an input integer; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, or `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
