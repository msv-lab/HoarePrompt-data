Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter p, which is a sorted list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, and the length of the list is between 1 and 100. The function returns a list remaining_players where each element remaining_players[n] is the final value of cur_n after it has been repeatedly decreased by the count of elements in p that are less than or equal to cur_n, until cur_n is less than the minimum value in p for each n from 1 to the maximum value in p.**
