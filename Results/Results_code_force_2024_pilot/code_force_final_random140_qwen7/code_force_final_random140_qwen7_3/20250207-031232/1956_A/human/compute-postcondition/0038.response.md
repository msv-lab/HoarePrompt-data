Output State: **`remaining_players[cur_n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\), `cur_n` is \(k + 1 - \text{count} - \text{count}\) and must be greater than or equal to `min(p)`, `count` is the index of the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`, and `count` is updated to the value returned by `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)`**

Explanation: The code `cur_n -= count` subtracts the value of `count` from `cur_n`. Since `count` is updated to the value returned by `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)` before this line, the new value of `cur_n` is the original `cur_n` minus the updated `count`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
