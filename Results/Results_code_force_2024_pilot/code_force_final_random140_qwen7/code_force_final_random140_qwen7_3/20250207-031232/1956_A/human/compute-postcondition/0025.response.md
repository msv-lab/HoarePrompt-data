Output State: **The program returns a string that is a space-separated list of string representations of the `res` list from each iteration, where `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`. The last set of inputs provided resulted in `k` being an integer, `q` being an integer, `p` being a list of integers, `qs` being a list of integers, `remaining_players` being the result of `func_1(p)`, and `res` being a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by `qs`.**

This means that after all iterations have completed, the final `results` list contains string representations of the `res` lists from each iteration, joined together by spaces. The `res` list for the last iteration is derived from the last values of `remaining_players` and `qs`.
