Output State: `cur_n` is -3*count, `count` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `-2*count` in the list `p`.

To understand this, let's break it down:

- Initially, `cur_n` is set to 4.
- After the first iteration, `cur_n` becomes 0, and `count` is the index in list `p` where `p[count]` is the smallest number greater than 4.
- After the second iteration, `cur_n` becomes -count, and `count` is the index in list `p` where `p[count]` is the smallest number greater than or equal to 0 using `bisect.bisect_right`.
- After the third iteration, `cur_n` becomes -2*count, and `count` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `-count` in the list `p`.

Following this pattern, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `cur_n` will be -3*count, where `count` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `-2*count` in the list `p`.
