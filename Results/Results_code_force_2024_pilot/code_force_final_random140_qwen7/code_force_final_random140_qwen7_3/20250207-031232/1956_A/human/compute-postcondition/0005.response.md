Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `qs`. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
