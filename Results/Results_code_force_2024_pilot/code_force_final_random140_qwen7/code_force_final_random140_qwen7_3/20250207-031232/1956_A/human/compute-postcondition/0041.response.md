Output State: **`remaining_players[cur_n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\), `cur_n` is decreased by `count`, `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to `min(p)`, `count` is the index of the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `remaining_players[cur_n]` remains \(-3 \times \text{count}\).
- The value of `cur_n` is decreased by `count`.
- The condition that `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to `min(p)` after the update is still valid.
- The value of `count` is the index of the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`, which does not change after the subtraction operation.
