Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`.
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `res` joined by spaces.

4. **Adjust the State for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer, it means `t` will be decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `t` will be decremented by 1.
   - All other variables (`res`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `results`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `res` joined by spaces.**
