Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `cur_n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop**: The loop will execute as long as `cur_n` is greater than or equal to `min(p)`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `remaining_players[cur_n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\), where \(\text{count}\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`.
   - `cur_n` is \(k + 1\).
   - `max_n` remains the same (though it's not relevant to the loop condition).

4. **Condition for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to `min(p)`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `cur_n` is \(k + 1\) and it needs to be greater than or equal to `min(p)` for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `k + 1` meets this condition.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `cur_n` (which is \(k + 1\)) is greater than or equal to `min(p)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`remaining_players[cur_n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\), where \(\text{count}\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`, `cur_n` is \(k + 1\) and must be greater than or equal to `min(p)`, and `max_n` remains the same.**
