Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided.
- `s` is a new string input by the user, but its content is not specified.
- `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`.
- `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`.
- `min_paint` is calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`.

The `min_paint` variable is calculated based on the positions of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string `s`. Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `min_paint`. However, we know it is the difference between the indices of the first and last 'B' plus one.

Output: **min_paint (where min_paint is the difference between the index of the last occurrence and the first occurrence of 'B' in the string s, plus one)**
