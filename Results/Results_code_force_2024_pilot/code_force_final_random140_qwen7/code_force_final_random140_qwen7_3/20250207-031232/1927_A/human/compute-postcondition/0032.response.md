Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'. For each test case, it calculates and prints the distance between the first and last 'B' characters in the string `s`. If no 'B' character is present, it prints 0. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.**
