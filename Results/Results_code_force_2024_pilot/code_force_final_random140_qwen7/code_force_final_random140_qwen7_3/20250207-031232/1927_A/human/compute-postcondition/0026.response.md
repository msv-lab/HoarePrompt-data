Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `t` is an input integer between 2 and 10 inclusive.
- `x` is a list of characters from a new input string.
- `start` is the index of the character 'B' in the list `x`.
- `end` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the reversed list `x` plus one.

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the values of `start` and `end`.

1. **Finding `start`:** This is the index of the first 'B' in the list `x`. Let's assume the input string is "ABCDAB". In this case, `start` would be 1 (since 'B' is at index 1).

2. **Finding `end`:** This is the index of the last 'B' in the reversed list `x` plus one. The reversed list of "ABCDAB" is "BAABCDA". The last 'B' in this reversed list is at index 3 (counting from 0), so `end` would be 3 + 1 = 4.

Given these assumptions, `end - start` would be 4 - 1 = 3.

Output: **3**
