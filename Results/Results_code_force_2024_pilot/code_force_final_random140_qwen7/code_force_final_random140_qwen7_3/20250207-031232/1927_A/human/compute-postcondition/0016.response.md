Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, `min_paint` is the difference between `last_black` and `first_black` plus one, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `t`, `s`, `first_black`, `last_black`, and `min_paint` remain unchanged from their initial state.
