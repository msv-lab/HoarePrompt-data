Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` is an input integer between 2 and 10 inclusive, `x` is a list of characters from the new input string. If the character 'B' is present in the list `x`, `i` remains 2, `t` remains unchanged, and `x` is a list of characters from the new input string with additional information about the indices of 'B'. Otherwise, `i` remains 2, `t` remains unchanged, and `x` is a list of characters from the new input string.
