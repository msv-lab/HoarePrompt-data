Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' does not exist in `s`.
- `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' does not exist in `s`.
- `min_paint` is the difference between `last_black` and `first_black` plus one.

The `print(min_paint)` statement will print the value of `min_paint`.

To determine the value of `min_paint`, we need to consider the following cases for the indices `first_black` and `last_black`:

1. If both `first_black` and `last_black` are -1 (meaning 'B' does not exist in `s`), then `min_paint` will be \(-1 + 1 = 0\).
2. If `first_black` is -1 but `last_black` is not -1, then `min_paint` will be \(last_black - (-1) + 1 = last_black + 1 + 1 = last_black + 2\).
3. If `last_black` is -1 but `first_black` is not -1, then `min_paint` will be \((-1) - first_black + 1 = -first_black\).
4. If both `first_black` and `last_black` are valid indices (i.e., they are not -1), then `min_paint` will be \(last_black - first_black + 1\).

Since the exact values of `first_black` and `last_black` are not specified, we can only describe `min_paint` in terms of these variables.

Output: **min_paint (where min_paint is the difference between last_black and first_black plus one)**
