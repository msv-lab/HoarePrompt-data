Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' does not exist in `s`, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' does not exist in `s`, `min_paint` is the difference between `last_black` and `first_black` plus one.**

Explanation: The code calculates `min_paint` as the difference between `last_black` and `first_black` plus one. This value is stored in `min_paint`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
