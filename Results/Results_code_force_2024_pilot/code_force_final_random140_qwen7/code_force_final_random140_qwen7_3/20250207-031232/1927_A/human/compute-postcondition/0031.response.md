Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', ensuring at least one character is 'B'. The function returns information based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` made up of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B'. For each set of inputs, the function performs some operation and returns the result.
