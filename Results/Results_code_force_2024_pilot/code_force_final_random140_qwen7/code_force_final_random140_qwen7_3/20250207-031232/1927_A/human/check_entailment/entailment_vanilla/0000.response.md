### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s` representing the strip of cells. This is also handled correctly.

3. **Finding Black Cells**: 
   - `first_black = s.find('B')`: This finds the index of the first black cell ('B') in the string `s`.
   - `last_black = s.rfind('B')`: This finds the index of the last black cell ('B') in the string `s`.

4. **Calculating Minimum Paint Length**:
   - `min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1`: This calculates the length of the segment between the first and last black cells, inclusive. This logic is correct because it ensures that all black cells are covered in one segment.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated minimum length for each test case. This is correct.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the program correctly identifies the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.

### Conclusion:

- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- It accurately computes the minimum length required to paint all cells white.
- The logic for finding the first and last black cells and calculating the segment length is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
