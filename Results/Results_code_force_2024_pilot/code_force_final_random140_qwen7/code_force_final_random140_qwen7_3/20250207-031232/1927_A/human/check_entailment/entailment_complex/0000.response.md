Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the strip `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Finding the First and Last Black Cells**: 
   - `first_black = s.find('B')` finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`.
   - `last_black = s.rfind('B')` finds the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Length**:
   - `min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1` calculates the length of the segment that needs to be painted white to ensure all black cells become white. This formula works because the segment must include both the first and last black cells, and all cells in between.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the calculated minimum length for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the program accurately computes the required minimum length for each test case. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the program.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
