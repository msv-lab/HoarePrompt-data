The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), followed by \( t \) pairs of integers \( n \) and strings \( s \). For each string \( s \), which consists of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B', it finds the indices of the first and last 'B' characters, calculates the minimum number of wall paints needed to cover all 'B' characters, and prints this value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
