Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of integers n and k. For each test case, it calculates and prints either k // 2 + 1 or ceil(k / 2) based on the parity conditions of k. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
