State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is given as a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
- The loop variable `_` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration of the loop.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, which is already given.
- Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `_` starts at 0.

Since `t` is already constrained to be a positive integer within the specified range, no further adjustment is needed for `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, which is guaranteed by the problem statement.
