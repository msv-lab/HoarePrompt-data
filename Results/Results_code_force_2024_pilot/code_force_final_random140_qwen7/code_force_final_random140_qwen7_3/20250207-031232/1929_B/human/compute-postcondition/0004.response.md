Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer, and it is specified that `k` is even with `k // 2` being odd.

We need to determine the value of `k // 2 + 1` that will be printed.

Let's break it down step by step:
1. Since `k` is even, `k // 2` will be an integer.
2. It is also given that `k // 2` is odd. Therefore, `k // 2` must be an odd number.
3. Adding 1 to an odd number results in an even number.

However, the specific value of `k` is not provided, but we know that `k // 2` is an odd number. Let's denote this odd number as `odd_number`.

So, `k // 2 + 1` will be the next even number after `odd_number`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k // 2 is an odd number and k // 2 + 1 is the next even number)**
