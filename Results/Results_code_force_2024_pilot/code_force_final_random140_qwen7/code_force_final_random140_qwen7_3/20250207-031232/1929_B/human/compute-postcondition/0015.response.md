Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer input split from the user, `k` is the second integer input split from the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and splits them into two variables `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `_` remains 2. The initial conditions for `n` and `k` are updated to reflect the input values.
