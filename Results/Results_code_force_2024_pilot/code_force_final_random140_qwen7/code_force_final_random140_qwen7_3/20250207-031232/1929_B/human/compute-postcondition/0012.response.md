Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(ceil(k / 2))`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `ceil` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division result of `k / 2`.
2. Since `k` is an integer, `k / 2` will be a floating-point number.
3. The `ceil` function will round this floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, we know that the output will be the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2)**
