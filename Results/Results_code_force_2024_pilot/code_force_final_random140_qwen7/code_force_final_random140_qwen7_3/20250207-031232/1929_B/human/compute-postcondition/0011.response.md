Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(k // 2 + 1)`.

Let's break it down:
- `k` is an integer input, but its specific value is not provided.
- The expression `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it will truncate the decimal part.
- Adding 1 to the result of the integer division gives us `k // 2 + 1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot provide a precise numerical answer. However, we can describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the second integer input)**
