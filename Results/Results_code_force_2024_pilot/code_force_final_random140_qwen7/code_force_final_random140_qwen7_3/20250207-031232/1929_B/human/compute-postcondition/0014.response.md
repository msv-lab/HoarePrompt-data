The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates `t` times. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, meaning it has completed one full cycle.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the loop starts with `_` being 1, after one iteration, `_` becomes 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input.**
