Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer input split from the user, `k` is the second integer input split from the user. If `k` is even and the result of `k // 2` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `_`, `n`, or `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`, `_`, `n`, or `k`.**
