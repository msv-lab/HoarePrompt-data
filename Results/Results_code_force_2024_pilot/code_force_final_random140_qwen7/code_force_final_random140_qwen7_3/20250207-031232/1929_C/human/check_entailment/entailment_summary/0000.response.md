Reasoning:
1. The program aims to determine if Sasha can achieve having at least `n` coins (`a` in the code) by following a betting strategy.
2. The provided solution uses a loop to calculate the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can eventually have at least `a` coins, given the constraints `k` and `x`.
3. The formula used in the loop is designed to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins subsequent bets to recover and exceed the initial `a` coins.
4. Specifically, the loop calculates `s` as follows:
   ```python
   s = 1
   for i in range(x):
       s += s // (k - 1) + 1
   ```
   This formula ensures that Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row and still have enough coins to continue betting and potentially exceed the initial `a` coins.
5. The logic checks if the initial number of coins `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. If so, it prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can achieve the goal; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the required logic. It accurately calculates the minimum starting coins needed to ensure Sasha can eventually have at least `a` coins, considering the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
