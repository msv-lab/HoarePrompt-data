You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    YES

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than or equal to 15, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 12, `s` is 16.
    #
    #Explanation: Based on the pattern observed, each iteration of the loop increases `i` by 1 and updates `s` according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. Starting from `s = 1`, after 3 iterations, `s` becomes 8. Following this pattern, after 6 iterations, `s` would be 16 (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2), and after 9 iterations, `s` would be 32. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 for each iteration, after 12 iterations, `i` will be 12. For the loop to execute all its iterations, `x` must be at least 15 because `i` starts at 3 and increases by 1 each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple inputs consisting of integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each set of inputs, it calculates the value of `s` using a specific formula in a loop. If `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated value of `s`, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each set of inputs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha needs to ensure he can have any number of coins `n` after placing bets.
   - The casino rules dictate how much Sasha wins or loses based on his bet.
   - Sasha can lose no more than `x` times consecutively.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` takes an input for the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - It initializes `s` to 1 and iterates `x` times, updating `s` in each iteration.
   - The update rule for `s` is `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the loop seems to be calculating the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can eventually have any number of coins `n`.
   - Specifically, the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` suggests a recursive approach where Sasha doubles his potential winnings after each loss, adjusted by the factor `k`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program checks if `a` (initial coins) is greater than or equal to `s` (minimum required coins).
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in the program is designed to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can eventually have any number of coins `n`.
   - The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` correctly models the growth of Sasha's potential winnings after each loss.
   - The program correctly determines whether Sasha can achieve the goal based on the initial number of coins `a`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n` given the constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
