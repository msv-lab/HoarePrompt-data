Output State: **`k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than 8, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 8, `s` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Given that `s` was initially 1, the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1` evaluates to 2 because `1 // (k - 1)` is 0 (assuming `k` is greater than 1), and adding 1 results in 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
