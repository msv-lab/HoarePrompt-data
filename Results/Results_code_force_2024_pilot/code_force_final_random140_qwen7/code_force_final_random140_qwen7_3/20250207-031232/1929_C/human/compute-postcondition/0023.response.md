Output State: `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than or equal to 8, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 6, `s` is 5.

This output state is calculated based on the pattern observed from the given states after the first three iterations. Each iteration increments `i` by 1 and `s` by 1, and `x` must be greater than or equal to the current value of `i`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be 6 and `s` will be 5, with `x` needing to be at least 8 to allow for these iterations to occur.
