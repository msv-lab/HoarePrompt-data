Output State: `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than or equal to 12, `i` is 9, `s` is 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` by 1 with each iteration and updates `s` based on its previous value. After 3 iterations, `s` becomes 4. Each subsequent iteration will double the previous value of `s` and add 1. Therefore, after 4 iterations, `s` would be \(2 \times 4 + 1 = 9\), and after 5 iterations, it would be \(2 \times 9 + 1 = 19\). However, since we are asked for the final state after all iterations, and the problem does not specify the exact number of iterations but implies it's the general state after all iterations, we can infer that `s` will continue to follow this pattern. Given the pattern, after all iterations, `s` will be \(2^4 = 16\) minus 8 (since it starts from 2 and each step is effectively doubling and adding 1), resulting in `s` being 8. The variable `i` remains 9 as it increments by 1 per loop but does not reset. The condition for `x` is that it must be greater than or equal to 12 to allow for at least 4 iterations, following the pattern observed.
