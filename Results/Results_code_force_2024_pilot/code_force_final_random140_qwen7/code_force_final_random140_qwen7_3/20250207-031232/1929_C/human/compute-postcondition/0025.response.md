Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer entered by the user.
- `x` must be greater than or equal to 8.
- `a` is an integer entered by the user.
- `i` is 7.
- `s` is 5.

The loop increments `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration. It runs until `x` is no longer greater than the current value of `i`. Given that `i` starts at 3 and increments by 1 each iteration, it will reach 7 after 4 iterations. Therefore, the loop will run 4 times, and after these iterations, `s` will be incremented to 4.

Since `x` must be at least 8 for the loop to complete all its iterations, the condition `a >= s` will always be true because `s` is 4 and `a` is an integer entered by the user, which means `a` can be any integer, including those greater than 4.

Thus, the expression `'YES' if a >= s else 'NO'` will evaluate to `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
