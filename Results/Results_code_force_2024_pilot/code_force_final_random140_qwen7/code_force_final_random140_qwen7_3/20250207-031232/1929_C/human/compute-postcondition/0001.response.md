Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. Since the actual values are not provided, they remain as integers entered by the user. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
