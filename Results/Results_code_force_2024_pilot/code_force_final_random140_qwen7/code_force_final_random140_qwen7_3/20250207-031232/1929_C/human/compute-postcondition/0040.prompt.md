Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    s = 1
    for i in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than 2, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 3, `s` is 5.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `x - 1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`), and `s` will be incremented based on the given formula within the loop. Given that the loop increments `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration, starting from `s = 1`, after 3 iterations, `s` becomes 5. The conditions on `x` and `k` remain as they were after the third iteration, meaning `x` must be greater than 2 to allow for 3 full iterations of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than or equal to 8, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 7, `s` is 5.

This output state is calculated based on the given loop and its behavior. Each iteration of the loop increments `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1`. After 3 iterations, `s` has been incremented to 4. Since the loop continues as long as `x` is greater than the current value of `i`, and `i` starts at 3 and increases by 1 each iteration, after 7 iterations (`i` will be 7), `x` must be at least 8 for the loop to complete all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than or equal to 12, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 9, `s` is 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` by 1 and update `s` according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. After 3 iterations, `i` remains 9 but `s` doubles with each iteration starting from 2. Therefore, after the loop has executed all its iterations (assuming `x` is large enough), `s` will be 8 (2 * 2 * 2). The value of `i` remains 9 as it is incremented only once per iteration of the loop. The other variables (`k`, `x`, and `a`) remain as initially described in the precondition since they are not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
