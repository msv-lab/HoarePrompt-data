Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The states of the other variables are not affected.**

This means that `t` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user, and it must be within the range of 1 to 5000. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and the list `a`) are not yet defined and retain their initial state of being undefined.
