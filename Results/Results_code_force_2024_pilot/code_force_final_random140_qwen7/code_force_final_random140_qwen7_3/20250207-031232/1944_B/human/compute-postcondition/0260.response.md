Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code, the values remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or conditional if one were present.
