Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `k` is equal to `req`, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `ans1`; otherwise, no changes are made to `ans1`.**

Explanation: The line `k = req` simply assigns the value of `req` to `k`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain the same as the initial state. The condition regarding `ans1` and `b[n - 1]` remains unchanged as well.
