Output State: **`sz` is either 4 or 6, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if necessary.**

Explanation: The initial state of `sz` is either 0 or 2. After executing `sz += 2`, `sz` is incremented by 2. Therefore, if `sz` was initially 0, it becomes 2, and if `sz` was initially 2, it becomes 4. The values of the other variables (`i`, `rdb`, `n`, `rgt`, `ldb`) remain unchanged as per the precondition. The most internal loop or if statement is exited if necessary, which is mentioned in the initial state.
