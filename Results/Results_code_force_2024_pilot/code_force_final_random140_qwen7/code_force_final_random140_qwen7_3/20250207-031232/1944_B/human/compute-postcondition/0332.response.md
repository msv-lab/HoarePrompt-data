Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing the element at index 1 of list `l`, `ans2` is a list containing the element at index 1 of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans1` will now contain the element at index 2 of list `l`. Since `ans2` was previously set to contain the element at index 1 of list `l`, it remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `k` are also unchanged.
