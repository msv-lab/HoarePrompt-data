Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `sz` is either 0 or 2.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element.
   - `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`.
   - `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements.
   - `ldb` must contain at least one element (excluding the first element).
   - If `(2 * k - sz >= 2)` is true, `sz` is set to 2; otherwise, `sz` is set to 0.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```
   This line of code prints two instances of `elem` with a space as the end character.

3. **Determine `elem`:**
   - From the initial state, there is no explicit definition for `elem`. However, the value of `elem` is not dependent on any of the conditions or variables mentioned in the code snippet itself. Therefore, we need to infer `elem` from the context of the problem.
   - Since `rdb` contains consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` and `ldb` must contain at least one element (excluding the first element), it implies that `elem` is likely one of the elements in `rdb`.

Given the lack of specific values for `elem`, we can only describe it in terms of the context. Since `rdb` contains consecutive duplicates from `rgt`, `elem` could be any of these duplicate elements.

Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is one of the consecutive duplicate elements in `rdb`)
