Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`sz`**: It is defined as the highest multiple of 2 that satisfies the inequality \(2 * k - sz \geq 2\). Without knowing the value of `k`, we cannot determine the exact value of `sz`. However, it is a specific value that satisfies the given condition.

2. **`i`**: It is equal to `n`. Since `n` is mentioned as the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, and `rgt` remains unchanged, `i` will be the length of this segment.

3. **`rdb`**: It contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element. This means `rdb` is derived from `rgt` but only includes consecutive duplicates, excluding the last one.

4. **`n`**: It retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`.

5. **`rgt`**: It remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements.

6. **`ldb`**: It is empty.

7. **`sng`**: It must contain at least one element.

Given the print statement is `print()`, it implies that there is no content to print. Therefore, the print statement will simply output nothing.

Output: **None**
