Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans1` contains all elements from `l` except the last one.
- `k` is 0.
- `ans2` contains all elements from `l` except the last one.
- `i` is equal to the length of `l`.

The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(l)`, and during each iteration, `ans1` and `ans2` append `l[i]`. Since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(l) - 1`, both `ans1` and `ans2` will contain all elements of `l` except the last one. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `l`.

Therefore, the `print(*ans1)` statement will print all elements of `l` except the last one.

Output: **all elements of l except the last one**
