Output State: **`ans1` contains the elements `[l[0], l[4], l[4]]`, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains the elements `[l[1], l[3]]`, and `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The code appends `l[i]` to `ans1`. Given that `i` is 4, `ans1` will now contain `[l[0], l[4], l[4]]`. The values of `k`, `ans2`, and `i` remain unchanged.
