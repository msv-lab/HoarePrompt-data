Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 0.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element.
- `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`.
- `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements.
- `ldb` must contain at least one element.
- The condition `(2 * k - sz >= 2)` is true.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print two instances of the same element, followed by a space. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `elem` is not mentioned in the initial state and no default value is provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem`.

Given the information, the most precise description of the output is that it will print two identical elements, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem**
