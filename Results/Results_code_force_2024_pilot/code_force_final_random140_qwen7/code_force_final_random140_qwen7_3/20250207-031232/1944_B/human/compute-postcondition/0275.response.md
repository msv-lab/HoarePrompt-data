Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `k` is either -2 or 0; `ans1` now contains the element `b[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) from the list `b` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is 3, `ans1` now includes the element `b[3]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
