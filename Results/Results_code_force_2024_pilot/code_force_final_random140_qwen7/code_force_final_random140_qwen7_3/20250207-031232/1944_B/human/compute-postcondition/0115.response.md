Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains all elements from `l`, `ans2` now contains all elements from `l` as pairs, `l` is an empty list, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split(' ')`, `b` is a slice of `a` containing the first `n` elements, `c` is a slice of `a` containing the remaining elements starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code `c = a[n:]` creates a new list `c` that contains all elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
