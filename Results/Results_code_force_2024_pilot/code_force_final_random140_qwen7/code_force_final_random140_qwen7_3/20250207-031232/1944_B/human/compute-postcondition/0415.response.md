Output State: **All elements in `rdb` have been printed in pairs (each element printed twice), and `sz` is equal to 2 times the number of elements printed.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `2 * k - sz >= 2`. Given that the loop executed up to 3 times, it means that `sz` was incremented by 2 each time until `2 * k - sz` became less than 2. After all iterations, `sz` will be equal to 2 times the number of elements printed, which is the total number of elements in `rdb` since each element was printed exactly once in a pair. The variable `rdb` will be empty after all its elements have been printed, but the problem statement does not require `rdb` to be empty; it only requires that all elements in `rdb` have been printed. The other variables (`n`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `k`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
