Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `k` is its initial value minus 2 times the number of consecutive duplicates found in the list `b` up to index `n-1`, `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` up to index `n-1`, `l` contains all unique elements from `b` up to index `n-1` that are not part of any pair in `ans1` and now includes `b[n-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[n - 1])` appends the value of `b[n - 1]` to the list `l`. Since `b[n-1]` is not already in `ans1`, it gets added to `l`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
