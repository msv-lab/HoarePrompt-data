Output State: `ldb` is an empty iterable, `rdb` is an empty iterable, `sz` is exactly 2 * k, and all elements in `sng` have been printed up to the point where `sz` equals 2 * k. 

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `ldb` and `rdb` will both be empty because they are cleared and reinitialized in each iteration of the loop. The variable `sz` will be exactly 2 * k because the loop continues to execute as long as `sz` is less than 2 * k, and once `sz` reaches 2 * k, the loop breaks. All elements in `sng` will have been printed up to the point where `sz` equals 2 * k, ensuring that no element is printed more than necessary to meet the condition `sz < 2 * k`.
