Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains the element `l[1]` from `l`, `ans2` now contains the elements `[l[0], l[i]]` from `l`, and `l` contains all unique elements from `c` up to index `n-1` that are not part of any pair in `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code appends `l[i]` to `ans2`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `l[i]` is `l[2]`. So, `ans2` changes from containing `[l[0]]` to `[l[0], l[2]]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
