Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int type using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged, while `a` is updated to hold the list of integers obtained from the input.
