Postcondition: `sng` must contain at least one element, and `elem` is the first element of `sng`. If the size of `sng` (denoted as `sz`) is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `sz >= 2 * k` is not met.
