Output State: **`sz` is the highest multiple of 2 that satisfies `2 * k - (sz + 1) >= 2`, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` is empty, and `sng` must contain at least one element. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the variables `sz`, `i`, `rdb`, `n`, `rgt`, and `ldb` retain their original values, and `sng` must still contain at least one element. The `break` statement causes us to exit the innermost loop or conditional block without changing these values.
