Output State: `ans1` contains all elements from `l`, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains all elements from `l`, and `i` is equal to the length of `l`.

Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as `k` is not equal to 0, and since `k` remains 0 throughout the loop, the loop will continue until it has iterated through all elements of `l`. During each iteration, the current element of `l` is appended to both `ans1` and `ans2`. After all iterations, `ans1` and `ans2` will contain all elements of `l`, and `i` will be equal to the length of `l`.
