Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` now contains all elements from `l` as pairs, `l` is an empty list, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split(' ')`, `b` is a slice of `a` containing the sorted first `n` elements, `c` is a slice of `a` containing the remaining elements starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted.**

Explanation: The line `ans1 = []` initializes `ans1` as an empty list. No other changes are made to the variables in the initial state, so their values remain unchanged.
