Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(len(l)):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `len(l)`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `len(l)` must be greater than 0
   - `k` is 0
   - `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` and includes the pair (l[0], l[0])
   - `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and continues to include `c[i]` for each iteration where `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]` and now also contains `l[i]`
   - `q` is 1
   - `req` is unchanged
   - `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(l)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, it needs to be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.
   - `len(l)` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be adjusted to 1.
   - `len(l)` remains unchanged.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - Variables like `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `q`, `req`, and `l` are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `len(l)` must be greater than 0**
