Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is unchanged, `k` is -4, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and now includes `c[i]`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and if `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, `c[i]` is appended to `ans2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, it simply breaks out of the context it was intended for (which could be a loop or an if-else statement). The values of all variables remain unchanged except for the fact that the execution flow is terminated at this point.
