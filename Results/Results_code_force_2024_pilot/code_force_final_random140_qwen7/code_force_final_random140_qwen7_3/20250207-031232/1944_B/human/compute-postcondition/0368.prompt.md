Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After executing `sz = 0`, the value of `sz` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, and `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`. The variable `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sz` is either 0 or 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` must contain at least one element, and if `(2 * k - sz >= 2)` is true, `sz` is set to 2; otherwise, `sz` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is either 0 or 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` must contain at least one element (excluding the first element), and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if necessary.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is either 0, 2, 4, or 6, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if necessary.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
