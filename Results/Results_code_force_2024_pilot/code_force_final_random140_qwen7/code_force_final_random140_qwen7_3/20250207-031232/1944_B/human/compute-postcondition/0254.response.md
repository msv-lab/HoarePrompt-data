Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` equals 0, `b[i - 1]` is now in `l`, `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 1, `b[i - 1]` refers to `b[0]`. Since `b[i - 1]` was not previously in `ans1`, the only change is that `b[0]` is now added to `l`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
