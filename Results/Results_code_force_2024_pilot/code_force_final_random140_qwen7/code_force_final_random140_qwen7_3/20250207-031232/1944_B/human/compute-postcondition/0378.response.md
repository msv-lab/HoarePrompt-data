Output State: **`sz` is the highest multiple of 2 that satisfies `2 * k - (sz + 1) >= 2`, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` is empty, and `elem` will iterate over the elements in `sng`.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. The updated condition for `sz` reflects this change.
