Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged, `k` is `-2 * (n - 1)`, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and continues to include `c[i]` for each iteration where `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and if `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, `c[i]` is appended to `ans2` until the end of the loop.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be `-2 * (n - 1)` because `k` decreases by 2 for each iteration, `ans1` will contain pairs of consecutive duplicates from `b` as found during the loop, `ans2` will accumulate `c[1]` and subsequent `c[i]` values that are duplicates of their preceding elements, `q` remains 1, `req` remains unchanged, `l` will be a list containing the last element of `b`, and `ans2` will continue appending `c[i]` to itself whenever consecutive duplicates are found.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0; `len(l)` must be greater than 0; `k` is 0; `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` and includes the pair (l[0], l[0]); `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and continues to include `c[i]` for each iteration where `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]` and now also contains `l[i]`; `q` is 1; `req` is unchanged; `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains the element at index 1 of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `k` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing the element at index 1 of list `l`, `ans2` is a list containing the element at index 2 of list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
