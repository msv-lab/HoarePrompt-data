Postcondition: **`sz` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` must contain at least one element, and the condition `(2 * k - sz >= 2)` is true**.
