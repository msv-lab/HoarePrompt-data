Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, and `k` equals 0. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is -2 and `ans1` contains the elements `b[3]` and `b[3]`. Otherwise, if `b[2]` is not in `ans1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.
