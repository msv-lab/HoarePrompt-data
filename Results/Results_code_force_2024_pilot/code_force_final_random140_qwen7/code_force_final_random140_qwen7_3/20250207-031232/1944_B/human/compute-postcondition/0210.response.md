Output State: **`ans1` contains the element `l[0]`, `k` is 0, `len(l)` must be at least 1, and `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans1`. Initially, `i` is 0. After appending `l[0]` to `ans1`, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The other variables (`k` and `len(l)`) remain unchanged.
