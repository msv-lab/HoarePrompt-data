Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (the first `n` elements of `a`), `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`), `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, and either `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) is equal to `b[i-1]` (which is `b[0]`), in which case `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` appended with `b[2]` and `k` is -2, or `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i-1]`, in which case `l` contains the value of `b[i-1]` (which is `b[0]`) if `b[i-1]` is not already in `ans1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and `k` is 0. If `b[2]` is equal to `b[1]`, then `ans1` contains the element `b[2]` twice. Otherwise, `ans1` contains `b[2]` and `b[1]` if `b[1]` is not already in `ans1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is updated to 3 and `k` remains unchanged. If `b[3]` equals `b[2]`, then `k` remains 1. Otherwise, if `b[2]` is not in `ans1`, `l` has an additional element which is equal to `b[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
