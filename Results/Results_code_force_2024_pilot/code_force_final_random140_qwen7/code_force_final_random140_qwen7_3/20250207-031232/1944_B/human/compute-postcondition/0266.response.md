Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `k` is 0; `l` contains the element `b[1]` (since `i-1` is 1).**

Explanation: The code appends the element `b[i-1]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 2, `i-1` is 1, so `b[1]` is appended to `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
