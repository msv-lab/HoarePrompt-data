Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains all elements from `l`, `ans2` now contains all elements from `l` as pairs, `l` is an empty list, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `input().split(' ')` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These values are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The values of `i`, `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state.
