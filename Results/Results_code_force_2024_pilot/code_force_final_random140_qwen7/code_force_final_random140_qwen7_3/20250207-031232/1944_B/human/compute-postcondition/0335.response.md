Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `k` is `-2 * (n - 1)`
- `ans1` is a list containing all pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop
- `ans2` is a list containing all elements from `c[1]` onwards where each element is a duplicate of its preceding element
- `q` is 1
- `req` is unchanged (its value is not specified, so it remains unchanged)
- `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`

The `print(*ans1)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans1`. Since `ans1` contains all pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, the exact content of `ans1` depends on the contents of `b`.

Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **all pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from b found during the loop**
