Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 0, and `ans2` now contains the element `c[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans2.append(c[3])` adds `c[3]` to `ans2`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `ans2` is updated with the new element.
