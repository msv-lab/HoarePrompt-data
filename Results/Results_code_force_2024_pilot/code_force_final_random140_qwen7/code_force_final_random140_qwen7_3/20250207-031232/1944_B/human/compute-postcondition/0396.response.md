Based on the initial state provided:

- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- The condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is true.

However, the specific values of `elem`, `k`, and `sz` are not provided. Since `rdb` contains at least one element, let's denote the element in `rdb` as `elem`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Since `elem` is an element from `rdb` and `rdb` contains at least one element, but the exact value of `elem` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of being an element from `rdb`.

Output: **elem elem**
