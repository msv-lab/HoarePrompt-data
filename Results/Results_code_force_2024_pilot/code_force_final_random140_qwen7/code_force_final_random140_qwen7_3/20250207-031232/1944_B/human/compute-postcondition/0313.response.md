Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` is unchanged, `k` is -6, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and now includes `c[i]` and `c[i]` is appended to `ans2`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and if `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, `c[i]` is appended to `ans2` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
