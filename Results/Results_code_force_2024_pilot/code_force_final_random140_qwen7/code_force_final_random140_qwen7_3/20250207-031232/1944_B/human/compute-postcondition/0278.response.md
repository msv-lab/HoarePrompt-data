Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is either -2 or 0, and `l` contains the element `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[i - 1])` appends the element `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 3, `b[i - 1]` corresponds to `b[2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
