Given the initial state where `rdb` must contain at least one element, and `sz` is either its current value or increased by 2, the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print two elements from `rdb`.

Since `rdb` contains at least one element, let's denote the first element of `rdb` as `elem`. When the statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` is executed, it will print the first element twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **elem elem**
