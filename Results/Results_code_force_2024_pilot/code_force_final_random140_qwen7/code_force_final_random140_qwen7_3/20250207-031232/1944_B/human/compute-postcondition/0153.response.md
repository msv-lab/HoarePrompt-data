Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` equals 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains the element `b[2]` appended to it, and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list with the element `b[i - 1]` appended.
