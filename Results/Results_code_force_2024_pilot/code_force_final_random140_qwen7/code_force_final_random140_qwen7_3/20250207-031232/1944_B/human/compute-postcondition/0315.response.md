Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged, `k` is `-2 * (n - 1)`, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and continues to include `c[i]` for each iteration where `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and if `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, `c[i]` is appended to `ans2` until the end of the loop.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be `-2 * (n - 1)` because `k` decreases by 2 for each iteration, `ans1` will contain pairs of consecutive duplicates from `b` as found during the loop, `ans2` will accumulate `c[1]` and subsequent `c[i]` values that are duplicates of their preceding elements, `q` remains 1, `req` remains unchanged, `l` will be a list containing the last element of `b`, and `ans2` will continue appending `c[i]` to itself whenever consecutive duplicates are found.
