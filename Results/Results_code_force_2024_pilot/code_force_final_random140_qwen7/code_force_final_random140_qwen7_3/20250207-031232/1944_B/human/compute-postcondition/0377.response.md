Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is the highest multiple of 2 that satisfies the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2`.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element.
- `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`.
- `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements.
- `ldb` is empty.
- `elem` will iterate over the elements in `sng`.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the current element being iterated over in the `sng` list, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

However, since the actual content of `sng` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem`. Therefore, the output will be the first element of the `sng` list followed by a space.

Output: **[first element of sng] **
