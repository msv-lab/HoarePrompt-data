Output State: **`ans1` contains the element `l[0]`, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains the element `l[1]`, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `ans2` now contains `l[1]`. Also, since `i` was incremented (assuming `i += 1` or similar logic), `i` is now 2. The other variables (`ans1` and `k`) remain unchanged.
