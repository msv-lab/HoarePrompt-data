Output State: **`rdb` contains at least one element, 2 * k - sz is less than 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. However, no variables are updated or reassigned within the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `rdb` and the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` remain unchanged.
