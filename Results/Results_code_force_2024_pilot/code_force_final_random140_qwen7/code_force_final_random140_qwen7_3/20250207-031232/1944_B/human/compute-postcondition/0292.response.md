Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `k` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `q`, `req`, `l`, or the conditions specified for adding elements to `ans1`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the only change is that the loop or conditional block is exited.
