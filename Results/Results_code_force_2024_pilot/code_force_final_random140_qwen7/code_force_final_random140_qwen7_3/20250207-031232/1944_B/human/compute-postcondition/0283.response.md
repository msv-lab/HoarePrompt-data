Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `k` is either -2 * (number of consecutive pairs in `b`) or 0, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is 1, and `req` is 0.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `k` will be either -2 multiplied by the number of consecutive duplicate pairs found in the list `b` (if any) or 0, depending on whether such pairs were found. The list `ans1` will contain all pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` that were encountered during the loop's execution. The list `ans2` remains empty, and the variables `q` and `req` retain their initial values of 1 and 0, respectively.
