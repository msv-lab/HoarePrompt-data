Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `len(l)` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and continues to include `c[i]` for each iteration where `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
