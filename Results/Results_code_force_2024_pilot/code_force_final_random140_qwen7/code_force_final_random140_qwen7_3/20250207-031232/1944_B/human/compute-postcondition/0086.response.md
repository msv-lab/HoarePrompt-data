Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 0, and `ans2` now contains the elements `[c[3], c[3]]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans2` initially contains the element `c[3]`, so after appending `c[3]` again, `ans2` will contain `[c[3], c[3]]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
