Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` now contains the element `b[2]` appended to it, `k` is decreased by 2.**

The value of `k` is decreased by 2, so `k -= 2` updates `k` to its current value minus 2. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `ans1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
