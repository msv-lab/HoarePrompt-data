Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( T \) (1 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 5000), where for each test case, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 5 × 10^4, 1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ ⌊\( n \)/2⌋) and a list of 2\( n \) integers. It then sorts the first \( n \) integers and the last \( n \) integers separately. The function identifies duplicate elements in the first half and single occurrences in both halves. Finally, it prints pairs of elements from the duplicates in the first half and single occurrences until the total count of printed elements equals \( 2k \). If there are not enough elements to reach \( 2k \), it stops printing. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that all elements in the duplicates and single occurrences lists are exhausted and the total count of printed elements is exactly \( 2k \).**
