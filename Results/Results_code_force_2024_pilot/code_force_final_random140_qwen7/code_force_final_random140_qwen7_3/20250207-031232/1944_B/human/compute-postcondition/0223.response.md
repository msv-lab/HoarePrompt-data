Output State: **`ans1` contains the elements `[l[0], l[4], l[4]]`, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains the elements `[l[1], l[3], l[4]]`, and `i` is 4.**

The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 4, `ans2` appends `l[4]` to its existing elements `[l[1], l[3]]`, resulting in `[l[1], l[3], l[4]]`. The other variables (`ans1`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
