Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split(' ')`, `b` is a slice of `a` containing the sorted first `n` elements, `c` is a slice of `a` containing the remaining elements starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted, `k` is 0, `req` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either -2 or 0 depending on the condition of the if statement. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]`. If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, then `l` contains the value of `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` equals 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains the element `b[2]` appended to it, and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list with the element `b[i - 1]` appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, and `k` equals 0. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is -2 and `ans1` contains the elements `b[3]` and `b[3]`. Otherwise, if `b[2]` is not in `ans1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
