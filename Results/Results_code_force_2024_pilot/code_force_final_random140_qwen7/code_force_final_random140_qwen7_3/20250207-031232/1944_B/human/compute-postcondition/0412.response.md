Output State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, and `sz` is either its current value or increased by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `rdb` or `sz`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the conditions and values of `rdb` and `sz` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement it was in.
