Based on the initial state provided, we know that `sng` is a list with at least two elements. However, the specific elements of `sng` are not explicitly mentioned. The `elem` variable is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined what its value is without additional context.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

Since `elem` is not defined in the initial state and there is no way to infer its value from the given information, we cannot determine what `elem` is.

Output: **elem**
