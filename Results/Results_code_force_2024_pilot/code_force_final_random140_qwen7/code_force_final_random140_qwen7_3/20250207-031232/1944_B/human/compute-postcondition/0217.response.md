Output State: **`ans1` contains the elements `[l[0], l[i]]`, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains the elements `[l[1], l[3]]`, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the value of `l[i]` (where `i` is 3) to `ans2`. Initially, `ans2` contains the element `l[1]`. After appending `l[3]`, `ans2` now contains both `l[1]` and `l[3]`. The other variables (`ans1`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
