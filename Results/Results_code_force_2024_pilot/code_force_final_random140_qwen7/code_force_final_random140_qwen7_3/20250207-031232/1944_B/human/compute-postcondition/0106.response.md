Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains the element `l[1]` from `l`, `ans2` now contains the elements `[l[0]]` from `l`, and `l` contains all unique elements from `c` up to index `n-1` that are not part of any pair in `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. After appending `l[1]` to `ans1`, `i` is incremented by 1 (though not shown in the code snippet, this is implied by the context), making `i` equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
