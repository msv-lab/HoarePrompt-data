Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains all elements from `l`, `ans2` now contains all elements from `l` as pairs, `l` is an empty list, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split(' ')`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements using space as the delimiter, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`. The initial values of `i`, `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, `q`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
