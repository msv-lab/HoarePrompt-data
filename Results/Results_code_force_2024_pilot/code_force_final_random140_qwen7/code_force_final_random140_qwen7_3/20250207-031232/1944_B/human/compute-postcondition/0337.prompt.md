Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The states of the other variables are not affected.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
            l.append(b[i - 1])
    if b[n - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains all elements from `l`, `ans2` now contains all elements from `l` as pairs, and `l` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `ans1` contains all elements from `l` except the last one, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains all elements from `l` except the last one, and `i` is equal to the length of `l`.

To understand this, let's analyze the loop:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(l)`.
- If `k` equals 0, the loop breaks, but since `k` is never modified within the loop, it will always continue until `i` reaches the length of `l`.
- During each iteration, `ans1` appends `l[i]`, and `ans2` also appends `l[i]`.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `ans1` and `ans2` will contain all elements of `l` except for the last one (since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(l) - 1`), and `i` will be equal to the length of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `-2 * (n - 1)`, `ans1` is a list containing all pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing all elements from `c[1]` onwards where each element is a duplicate of its preceding element, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
