Output State: **`ans2` contains the value of `c[1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, and the current value of `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 1, `c[i]` is equivalent to `c[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
