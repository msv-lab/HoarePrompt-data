Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains the element `l[i]` from `l`, `ans2` now contains the element `l[i]` from `l`, and `l` contains all unique elements from `c` up to index `n-1` that are not part of any pair in `ans2`, `l` must contain at least one element, and either `i` is less than or equal to `len(l) - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
