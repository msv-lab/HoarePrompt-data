Output State: **`sz` is the highest multiple of 2 that satisfies \(2 * k - (sz + 1) \geq 2\) + 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` is empty, and `sng` must contain at least one element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain the same, and the only change is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was in.
