Output State: **`sz` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` must contain at least one element, and the condition `(2 * k - sz >= 2)` is true.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` was initially 0 and was incremented by 2, making `sz` equal to 2. The other variables (`i`, `rdb`, `n`, `rgt`, `ldb`) remain unchanged and retain their original values and conditions. The condition `(2 * k - sz >= 2)` remains true since `sz` is now 2.
