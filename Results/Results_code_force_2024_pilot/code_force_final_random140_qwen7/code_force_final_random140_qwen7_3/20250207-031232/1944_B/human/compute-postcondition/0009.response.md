Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (the first `n` elements of `a`), `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`), `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = []` initializes an empty list named `ans2`. Since no other changes are made to the existing variables, their values remain unchanged.
