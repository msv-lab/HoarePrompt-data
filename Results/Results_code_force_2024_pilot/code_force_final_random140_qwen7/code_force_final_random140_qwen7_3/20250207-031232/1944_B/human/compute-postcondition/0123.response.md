Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently `-1`.
   - `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is used in the range function.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Initially, `i` is `-1`, so for the loop to start executing, `i` must transition from `-1` to `1` (the start of the range).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at `-1`, it needs to be adjusted to `1` to satisfy the loop condition.
   - `n` should be greater than `1` to allow the loop to execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
