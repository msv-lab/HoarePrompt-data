Postcondition: **`sz` is the highest multiple of 2 that satisfies \(2 * k - (sz + 1) \geq 2\) + 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` is empty, and `sng` must contain at least one element, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
