Output State: **After executing `sz = 0`, the value of `sz` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, and `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`. The variable `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `sz` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `rdb`, `n`, or `rgt`. Therefore, the only change is that `sz` is now 0. The conditions described for `i`, `rdb`, `n`, and `rgt` remain the same as they were before the execution of this line of code.
