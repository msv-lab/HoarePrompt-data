Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split(' ')`, `b` is a slice of `a` containing the sorted first `n` elements, `c` is a slice of `a` containing the remaining elements starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted, `k` is 0 (which was previously 0, now doubled to 0), `req` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `req = k` assigns the current value of `k` (which is 0) to the new variable `req`. All other variables remain unchanged.
