Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `k` is `-2 * (n - 1)`, `ans1` is a list containing all pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing all elements from `c[1]` onwards where each element is a duplicate of its preceding element, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`. Since the loop breaks when `k` reaches `0`, and `k` decreases by `2` for each iteration, `k` will be `-2 * (n - 1)` after `n-1` iterations. The lists `ans1` and `ans2` will contain all the necessary elements as described, with `ans1` holding pairs of consecutive duplicates from `b` and `ans2` holding all consecutive duplicates from `c[1]` onwards. The variables `q` and `req` remain unchanged, and `l` will be a list containing the last element of `b`.
