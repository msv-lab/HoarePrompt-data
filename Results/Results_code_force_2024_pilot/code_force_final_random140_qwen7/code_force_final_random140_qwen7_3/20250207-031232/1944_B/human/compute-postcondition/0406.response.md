Output State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is either its current value or increased by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `rdb` or `sz`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was inside. Therefore, the conditions and values of `rdb` and `sz` remain unchanged from their initial state.
