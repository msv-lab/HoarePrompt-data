Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans2` has appended `c[3]`.**

The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[3]` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 3, `c[3]` is appended to `ans2`. The conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
