Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is unchanged.

3. **Update the state of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration (`i = 1`), `i` becomes 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Check the new value of `i`**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - All other variables (`k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `q`, `l`, `req`, `c`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is unchanged, `k` is -4, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and now includes `c[i]`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and if `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, `c[i]` is appended to `ans2`**.
