Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), as specified by `for i in range(1, n)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, then `rdb` remains `[rgt[0]]`.
   - Otherwise, `rdb` becomes `[rgt[0], rgt[2]]`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will increment `i` by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue.

6. **Consider the List `rdb`**:
   - The value of `rdb` depends on the condition involving `rgt[2]` and `rgt[1]`. However, since the loop head does not directly affect `rdb`, we do not need to change its value here.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
