Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, and either `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, in which case `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1` and `l` contains the value of `b[i - 1]`, or `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, and `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` appended with `b[2]`.
