Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is equal to the length of `l`, `q` is 1, `k` is 0.**

The code `k = 2 * k` doubles the value of `k`. Initially, `k` is 0, so after executing the code, `k` remains 0. All other variables (`ans1`, `ans2`, `i`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
