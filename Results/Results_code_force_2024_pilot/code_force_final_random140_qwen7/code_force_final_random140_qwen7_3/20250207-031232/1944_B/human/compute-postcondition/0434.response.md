Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is increased by 1, meaning `sz` is now at least 2.
- `sng` must contain at least two elements.
- The size of `sng` must be less than 2 times `k`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print(elem, end=' ')` will print the value of `elem`.

However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe it in terms of its context within the code.

Output: **elem (where elem is the element being processed in the loop or if statement)**
