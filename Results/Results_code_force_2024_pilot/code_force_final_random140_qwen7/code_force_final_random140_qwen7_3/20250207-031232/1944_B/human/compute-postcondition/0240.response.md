Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially equal to the length of an empty list `[]`, which means `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an unknown variable, but we need to ensure that the loop condition `1 <= i < n` holds true.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `1 <= i < n`. Given that `i` starts at 0, the loop will not execute because `1 <= 0 < n` is false for any value of `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is 0, we need to change `i` to a value such that `1 <= i < n` holds true. The smallest value `i` can take to satisfy this condition is 1.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 (since `i` starts at 0, `n` must be at least 2 to allow `i` to become 1).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
