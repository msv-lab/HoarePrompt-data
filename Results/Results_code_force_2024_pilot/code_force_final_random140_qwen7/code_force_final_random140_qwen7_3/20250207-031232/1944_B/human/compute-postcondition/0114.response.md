Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains all elements from `l`, `ans2` now contains all elements from `l` as pairs, `l` is an empty list, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split(' ')`, `b` is a slice of `a` containing the first `n` elements.**

Explanation: The code `b = a[:n]` creates a slice of the list `a` containing the first `n` elements and assigns it to `b`. Since the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, `b` will contain the first `n` elements of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
