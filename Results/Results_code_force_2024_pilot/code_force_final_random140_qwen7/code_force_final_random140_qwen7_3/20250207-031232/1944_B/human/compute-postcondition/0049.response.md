Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` remains unchanged, and `ans1` has appended `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is updated to 3, `b[i]` refers to the element at index 3 in the list `b`. Since `k` remains unchanged and the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement (`k == 0`) is not mentioned to be true, `k` stays as it was before. Therefore, `i` is now 3, `k` remains unchanged, and `ans1` has appended the value of `b[3]`.
