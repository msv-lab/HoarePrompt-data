Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `elem` and `sng`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `sng` contains at least one element.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sng` must contain at least one element.
   - `elem` is the first element of `sng`.
   - `sz` is increased by 1.

4. **Determine the changes for the next iteration**:
   - Since `elem` is the first element of `sng`, removing `elem` from `sng` will leave `sng` with at least one element if it originally had more than one element.
   - After the first iteration, `sng` should now contain all elements except the first one (since `elem` was the first element).
   - `sz` is increased by 1, meaning `sz` is now 2 (assuming it started at 1).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `sng` must now contain at least one element (the remaining elements after removing the first one).
   - `elem` will be the new first element of the updated `sng`.
   - `sz` will be 2.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`, `sz` is 2**
