Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` remains unchanged, and `ans1` contains the element `b[3]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` from the list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans1` will contain the element `b[3]`. The value of `i` is updated to 3, and `k` remains unchanged.
