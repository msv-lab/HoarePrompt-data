Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `rdb` has the element `rgt[i]` appended to it.**

In this case, the code appends the element `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Since `i` is 3, `rdb` will now have the element `rgt[3]` added to it. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
