Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), as indicated by `range(1, n)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `k` is either -2 or 0

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `3`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now `3`, `n` must be greater than `3` for the loop to execute again.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the value of `i` to `3` and ensure that `n` is greater than `3`.

7. **Consider the variable `k`**: The value of `k` does not change based on the loop itself but rather on the conditions inside the loop body. Since no information is given about how `k` changes within the loop body, we assume `k` remains either `-2` or `0` as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `k` is either -2 or 0**.
