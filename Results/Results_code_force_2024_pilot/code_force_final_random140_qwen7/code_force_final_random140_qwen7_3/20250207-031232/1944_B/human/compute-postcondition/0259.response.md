Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `k` equals 0
   - The postconditions for the loop body are:
     - If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]`.
     - If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `b[i - 1]` is added to `ans1`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and runs until `i` is less than `n`.
   - At the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 1
   - Since `n` must be at least 2, it could be 2 or greater.
   - `k` is 0 (this value doesn't change within the loop).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable that changes within the loop head is `i`.
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

6. **Postconditions:**
   - Since `i` is now 2, we need to consider the conditions for the next iteration.
   - The loop will check if `i` (which is now 2) is less than `n`.
   - If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 2
- `k` is still 0

So, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is 0**
