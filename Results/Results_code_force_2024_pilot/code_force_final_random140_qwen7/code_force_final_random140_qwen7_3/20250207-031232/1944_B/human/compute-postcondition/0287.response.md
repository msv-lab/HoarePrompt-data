Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is either -2 times the number of consecutive pairs in `b` or 0, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is 1, `req` is 0, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`. If the last element of `b` is not in `ans1`, then the last element is added to `ans1`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.
