Postcondition: `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains the element `l[0]` from `l`, `ans2` now contains the elements `[l[0]]` from `l`, and `l` contains all unique elements from `c` up to index `n-1` that are not part of any pair in `ans2`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
