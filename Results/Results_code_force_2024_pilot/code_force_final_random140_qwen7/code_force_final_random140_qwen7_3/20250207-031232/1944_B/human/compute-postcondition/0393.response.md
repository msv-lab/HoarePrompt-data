Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` which iterates over the elements of `rdb`.

2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `rdb`.
   - The other variables (`sz`, `i`, `n`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `sng`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `rdb` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `rdb` has at least one element.
   - The other variables (`sz`, `i`, `n`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `sng`) do not need to be adjusted as they do not influence the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `rdb` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element**
