Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is unchanged, `k` is -4, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and now includes `c[i]`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and `c[i]` is appended to `ans2`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, changing its value from -2 to -4. The values of `i`, `n`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `q`, `req`, `l`, and the condition for appending `c[i]` to `ans2` remain unchanged.
