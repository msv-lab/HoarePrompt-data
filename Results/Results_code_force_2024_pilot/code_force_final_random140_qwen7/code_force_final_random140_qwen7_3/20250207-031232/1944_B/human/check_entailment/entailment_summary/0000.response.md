Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the first half of the array `b` and the second half of the array `c`, and then constructing the output lists `ans1` and `ans2` based on these sorted halves. However, this approach does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans1` will be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans2`. The program's logic does not ensure that the selected elements from both halves will have the same XOR value.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` (subset of the first half) matches the XOR of the elements in `r` (subset of the second half). The current implementation does not address this requirement.

Given the execution summary, the program's behavior does not align with the problem requirements. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
