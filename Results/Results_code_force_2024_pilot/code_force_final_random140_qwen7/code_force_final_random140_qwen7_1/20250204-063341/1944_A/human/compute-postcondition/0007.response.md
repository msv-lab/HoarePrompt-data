Output State: **`k` is `k - reachable_count`, `n` must be greater than 1 and `k` must be at least `n - 1`, `reachable_count` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `reachable_count -= 1` decreases the value of `reachable_count` by 1. The other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` is now `k - (reachable_count - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `k - reachable_count`. The conditions that `n` must be greater than 1 and `k` must be at least `n - 1` still hold true.
