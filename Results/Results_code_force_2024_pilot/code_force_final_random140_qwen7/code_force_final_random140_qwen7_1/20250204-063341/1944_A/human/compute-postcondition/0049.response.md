Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a new value for \( reachable_count \) based on \( n \) and \( k \), and prints the final value of \( reachable_count \). The function ultimately returns the last printed value, which is always 1 when the loop ends.**
