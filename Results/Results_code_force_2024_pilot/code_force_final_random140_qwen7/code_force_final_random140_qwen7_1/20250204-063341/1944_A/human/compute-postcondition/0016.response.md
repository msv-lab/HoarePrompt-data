Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is reduced to `k - n + 1`
- `reachable_count` is reduced to `n - 1`
- Both `k` and `reachable_count - 1` are greater than 0 after the loop has executed all its iterations.

From this, we can deduce that `reachable_count` is explicitly stated to be reduced to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the print statement `print(reachable_count)` will output the value of `reachable_count`, which is `n - 1`.

Output: **n - 1**
