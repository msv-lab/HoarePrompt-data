Output State: **`k` is `n - 3 * 2` and `reachable_count` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation: The initial state is `k - n`, `reachable_count` must be `n - 3`, and `k` must satisfy `k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0`. The code `k -= reachable_count - 1` subtracts `reachable_count - 1` from `k`. Since `reachable_count` is `n - 3`, `reachable_count - 1` is `n - 4`. Therefore, `k` becomes `k - (n - 4)`, which simplifies to `k - n + 4`. Given that `k` was initially `n - reachable_count + 1` (since `k >= reachable_count - 1` and `reachable_count` is `n - 3`), substituting `reachable_count` gives `k` as `n - (n - 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `4`. Thus, `k` becomes `4 - (n - 4)`, which simplifies to `n - 3 * 2`. The value of `reachable_count` remains `n - 3`.
