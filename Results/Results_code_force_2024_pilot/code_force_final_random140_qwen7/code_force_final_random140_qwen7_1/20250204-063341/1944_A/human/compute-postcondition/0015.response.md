Output State: `k` is reduced to `k - n + 1`, `reachable_count` is reduced to `n - 1`, and both `k` and `reachable_count - 1` are greater than 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `k` will be reduced by the total amount of `n - 1`, and `reachable_count` will be reduced to `n - 1`. Both `k` and `reachable_count - 1` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to have completed all its iterations.
