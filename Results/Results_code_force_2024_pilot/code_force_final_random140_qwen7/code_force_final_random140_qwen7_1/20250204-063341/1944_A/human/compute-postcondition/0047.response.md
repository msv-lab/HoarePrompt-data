Output State: **reachable_count is 1, k is 0.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `reachable_count` will be reduced to 1, and `k` will be reduced to 0. This is because the loop continues to decrement `reachable_count` and `k` until `k` is no longer greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1` and `k` is greater than 0. Once `reachable_count` reaches 1, further iterations would make `k` non-positive, causing the loop to terminate with `reachable_count` at 1 and `k` at 0.
