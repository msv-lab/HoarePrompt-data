Output State: **`k` is `k - 2 * (reachable_count - 1) + 1 - (reachable_count - 1)`, `reachable_count` is `reachable_count - 1`, and both `k` and `reachable_count - 1` are greater than 0.**

Explanation: Initially, `k` is set to `k - 2 * (reachable_count - 1) + 1` and `reachable_count` is set to `reachable_count - 1`. The code `k -= reachable_count - 1` subtracts `reachable_count - 1` from `k`. Therefore, the new value of `k` becomes `k - 2 * (reachable_count - 1) + 1 - (reachable_count - 1)`. Both `k` and `reachable_count - 1` must remain greater than 0.
