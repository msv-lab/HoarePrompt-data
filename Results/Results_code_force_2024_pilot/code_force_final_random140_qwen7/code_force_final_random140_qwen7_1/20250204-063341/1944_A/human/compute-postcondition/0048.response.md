Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers: t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. It returns a value based on the relationship between n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts `t`, `n`, and `k` through its execution context and checks if `k` falls within the specified range relative to `n`. It then returns a value based on this relationship.
