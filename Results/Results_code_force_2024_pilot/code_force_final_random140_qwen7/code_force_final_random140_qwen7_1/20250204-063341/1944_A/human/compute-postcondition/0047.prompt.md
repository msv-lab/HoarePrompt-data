Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `qs` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(qs):
    n, k = [int(num) for num in input().split()]
    reachable_count = n
    while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
        k -= reachable_count - 1
        reachable_count -= 1
    print(reachable_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `k` is reduced to `k - n + 1`, `reachable_count` is reduced to `n - 1`, and both `k` and `reachable_count - 1` are greater than 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `k` will be reduced by the total amount of `n - 1`, and `reachable_count` will be reduced to `n - 1`. Both `k` and `reachable_count - 1` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to have completed all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: reachable_count is 1, k is 0.

Explanation: Given the conditions and the behavior of the loop, we can deduce the final state after all iterations. The loop continues as long as `k >= reachable_count - 1` and `k > 0`. After each iteration, `k` is reduced by `reachable_count - 1` and `reachable_count` is decreased by 1. 

Starting from the given conditions:
- Initially, `reachable_count` is `n` and `k` is reduced to `k - (n - 1) - (n - 1)`.
- After the first iteration, `reachable_count` becomes `n - 1` and `k` becomes `k - n + 1`.
- After the second iteration, `reachable_count` becomes `n - 2` and `k` becomes `n - reachable_count` which is `n - (n - 2) = 2`.
- After the third iteration, `reachable_count` becomes `n - 3` and `k` becomes `n - 5`.

Since `n` is less than or equal to 5, the maximum value `reachable_count` can take is `n - 3`. When `reachable_count` reaches 1, the condition `k >= reachable_count - 1` will no longer hold because `k` would be reduced to a value less than or equal to 0. Therefore, the loop terminates when `reachable_count` is 1 and `k` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `k` is `n - (3 * (n - 1))`, `reachable_count` is `n - (3 + 1)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `k` will be `n - 3(n - 1)`, which simplifies to `n - 3n + 3 = 3 - 2n`. The `reachable_count` will be `n - 4`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
