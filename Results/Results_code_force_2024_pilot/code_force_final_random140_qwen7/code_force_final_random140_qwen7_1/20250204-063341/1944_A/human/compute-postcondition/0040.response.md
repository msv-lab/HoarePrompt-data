Output State: **`k - n`, `reachable_count` is `n - 3`**

Explanation: Initially, `k` is set to `k - n` and `reachable_count` is set to `n - 2`. The code `reachable_count -= 1` decreases the value of `reachable_count` by 1. Since `reachable_count` was initially `n - 2`, after the operation, it becomes `n - 3`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
