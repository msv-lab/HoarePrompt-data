Output State: **reachable_count is n - 1, k is k - n + 1**

Explanation: Initially, `reachable_count` is set to `n`, and `k` is equal to `k - n + 1`. After executing `reachable_count -= 1`, `reachable_count` is decremented by 1, making it `n - 1`. The value of `k` remains unchanged from its initial calculation since no operation directly affects `k` after this line.
