Output State: **`k` is `n - reachable_count`, `reachable_count` is `n - 2`**

Explanation: Initially, `k` is `n - (reachable_count - 1)` which simplifies to `n - (n - 1 - 1)` or `k is 2`. The line `reachable_count -= 1` decrements `reachable_count` by 1, making it `n - 2`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as the code does not directly modify it, only `reachable_count` is updated.
