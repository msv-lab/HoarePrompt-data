Output State: **`k` is `k - (reachable_count - 1)`, `n` must be greater than 1 and `k` must be at least `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(reachable_count - 1)` from its current value. The initial conditions state that `k` must be greater than 0 and at least `n - 1`. After the operation, these conditions are still valid, but `k` is now `k - (reachable_count - 1)`.
