Output State: **`reachable_count` is 1, `k` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `reachable_count` and `k` from the initial state are preserved, and now `n` holds the first integer input and `k` holds the second integer input.
