Output State: **`k` is `n - 6`, `reachable_count` is `n - 4`**

Explanation: Initially, `k` is set to `n - 3 * 2`, which simplifies to `n - 6`. Similarly, `reachable_count` is set to `n - 3`. The code `reachable_count -= 1` decrements `reachable_count` by 1. Since `reachable_count` was initially `n - 3`, after decrementing by 1, it becomes `n - 4`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
