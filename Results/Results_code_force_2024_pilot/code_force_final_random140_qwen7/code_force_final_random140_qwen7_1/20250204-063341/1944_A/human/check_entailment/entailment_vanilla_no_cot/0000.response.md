Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` does not take into account the optimal way to destroy bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    # If k is greater than or equal to n-1, Everule can only visit island 1
    if k >= n - 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # Otherwise, Everule can visit n - k islands
        return n - k + 1
```

This corrected function ensures that when `k` is large enough to destroy all bridges except those connecting to island 1, Everule can only visit island 1. For smaller values of `k`, it calculates the number of islands Everule can visit by subtracting `k` from the total number of islands minus one (since island 1 is always reachable).
