### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 0 \)
     - No bridges can be destroyed, so all islands (both islands 1 and 2) are reachable.
     - Expected output: 2
   - **Case 2**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 1 \)
     - One bridge can be destroyed, so one island (either 1 or 2) will be unreachable.
     - Expected output: 1
   - **Case 3**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 1 \)
     - One bridge can be destroyed, but it's not enough to isolate any island from island 1.
     - Expected output: 4
   - **Case 4**: \( n = 5 \), \( k = 10 \)
     - All bridges can be destroyed, so only island 1 is reachable.
     - Expected output: 1
   - **Case 5**: \( n = 5 \), \( k = 3 \)
     - Three bridges can be destroyed, but not enough to isolate any island from island 1.
     - Expected output: 5
   - **Case 6**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 4 \)
     - All bridges can be destroyed, so only island 1 is reachable.
     - Expected output: 1

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - If \( k \geq n - 1 \), the function returns 1. This means that if more than or equal to \( n - 1 \) bridges can be destroyed, only island 1 is reachable.
   - Otherwise, the function returns \( n \). This means that fewer than \( n - 1 \) bridges can be destroyed, so all islands are reachable.

3. **Function Implementation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the conditions for when all islands are reachable and when only island 1 is reachable.
   - The function correctly returns the expected values for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program logic matches the problem statement and the provided test cases. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
