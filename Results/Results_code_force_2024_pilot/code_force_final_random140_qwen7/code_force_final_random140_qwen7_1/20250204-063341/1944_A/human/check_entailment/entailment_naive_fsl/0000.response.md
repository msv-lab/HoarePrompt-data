Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n-1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `k` is less than `n-1`, Everule should be able to visit more than one island. However, the current implementation always returns `n` when `k < n-1`, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `k = 1`. In this scenario, destroying one bridge would still allow Everule to visit all four islands. The correct output should be `4`, but the program outputs `4` regardless of the value of `k` as long as `k < n-1`.

To fix this, the logic inside `func_1` needs to be adjusted to ensure that when `k < n-1`, the function returns a value greater than 1. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n - 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n - (k + 1)
```

This corrected function ensures that when `k < n-1`, the number of islands Everule can visit is reduced by `k + 1` (since destroying `k` bridges can isolate up to `k + 1` islands from Everule).
