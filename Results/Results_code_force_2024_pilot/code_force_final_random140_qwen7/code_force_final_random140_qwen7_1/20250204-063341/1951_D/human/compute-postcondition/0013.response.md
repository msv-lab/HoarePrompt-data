Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than `k`.
- The condition \((k - 1 < n - k + 1)\) is true.

We need to determine the values that will be printed by the statement `print(n - k + 1, 1)`.

First, let's simplify the expression \(n - k + 1\):
- Since `n` is an integer greater than `k`, \(n - k\) will be a positive integer.
- Adding 1 to \(n - k\) will result in another integer, specifically \(n - k + 1\).

Next, consider the second part of the print statement, which is the integer `1`.

Given that the condition \((k - 1 < n - k + 1)\) is true, it confirms that \(n - k + 1\) is indeed a valid integer and satisfies the inequality.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of \(n - k + 1\) followed by the integer `1`.

Output: **n - k + 1, 1**
