Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each t, it processes two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). The function does not return a value explicitly but processes each test case based on the given constraints and returns results for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation based on these inputs, but since the specific operation is not detailed, the focus is on the input constraints and implied processing rather than the exact return value.
