Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than `k`, and the function evaluates whether `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)`. If the condition is true, the function does not change `t`. If the condition is false, the function also does not change `t`. Therefore, `t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
