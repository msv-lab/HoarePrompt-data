Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `n` is greater than `k`.
- \(k - 1 \geq n - k + 1\).

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement is fixed and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`, the output will always be the string 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
