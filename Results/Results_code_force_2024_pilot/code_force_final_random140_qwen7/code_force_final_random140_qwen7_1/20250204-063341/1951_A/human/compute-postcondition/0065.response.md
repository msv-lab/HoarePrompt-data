Output State: The `results` list will contain 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated for each input string `arr` over all iterations. For each iteration, `n` (an integer) and `arr` (a string) are read from input. The variable `count_ones` counts the number of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` is 0, 'yes' is appended to `results`. If `count_ones` is odd, 'no' is appended. If `count_ones` is exactly 2, 'no' is appended if '11' is in `arr`, otherwise 'yes' is appended. For any other even `count_ones`, 'yes' is appended if '11' is not in `arr`, otherwise 'no' is appended. After all iterations, `results` will contain the outcomes for each input string `arr` according to the specified conditions.
