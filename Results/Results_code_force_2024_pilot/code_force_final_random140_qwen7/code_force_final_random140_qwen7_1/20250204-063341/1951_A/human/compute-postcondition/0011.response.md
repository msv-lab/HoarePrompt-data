Output State: **`count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr` and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a string input by the user; the current value of `count_ones` is odd; `results` list now contains 'no'.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the `results` list. Since no other variables are affected, their states remain unchanged. The precondition that `count_ones` is greater than 0 and is currently odd, and that `n` is an input integer and `arr` is a string input by the user, are still valid.
