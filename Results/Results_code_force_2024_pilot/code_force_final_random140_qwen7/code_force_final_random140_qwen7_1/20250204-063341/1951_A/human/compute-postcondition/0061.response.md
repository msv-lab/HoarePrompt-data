Postcondition: `arr` is the input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `t` is `t - 1`. If `count_ones` is odd, `results` includes 'no'. If `count_ones` is even, `results` includes 'yes' if '11' is found in `arr`, and 'no' otherwise, with `count_ones` being updated to the number of '1's in `arr`.
