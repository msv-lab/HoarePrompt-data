Output State: **`arr` is the input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` includes 'no', and `count_ones` is updated to the number of '1's in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `results.append('no')` appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `count_ones`, `t`, or the updated value of `count_ones`. The precondition that `results` includes 'yes' if '11' is found in `arr` when `count_ones` is even, and 'no' otherwise, remains valid. Since the code only appends `'no'` to `results`, the output state reflects this change while keeping the other variables unchanged.
