Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `r` and the iterable `results`.

2. **Understand the Iteration Context**: At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is the second element of `results`. This means that the loop has already iterated over the first element of `results`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be the third element of `results`.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to update the state such that `r` is the third element of `results`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `r` is now the third element of `results`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`r` is the third element of `results`**
