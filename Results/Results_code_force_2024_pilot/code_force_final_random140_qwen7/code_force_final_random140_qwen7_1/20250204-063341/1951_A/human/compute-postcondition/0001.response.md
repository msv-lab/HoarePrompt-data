Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `start`, `end`, or `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
