Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `r` is the first element of `results`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for r in results:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `r` was set to the first element of `results`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `r` needs to be set to the next element in the `results` list.
   - Since `r` was the first element previously, the next element would be the second element.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - We need to update the state such that `r` is now the second element of `results`.
   - The number of elements in `results` remains the same, but `r` changes to the next element.

### Final State

State: **`r` is the second element of `results`**
