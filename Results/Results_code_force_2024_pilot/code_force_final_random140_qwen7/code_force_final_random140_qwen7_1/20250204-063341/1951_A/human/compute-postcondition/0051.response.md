Output State: **`arr` is the input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` includes 'yes', and `count_ones` is updated to the number of '1's in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. The other variables (`arr`, `count_ones`, `t`, and the updated `count_ones`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
