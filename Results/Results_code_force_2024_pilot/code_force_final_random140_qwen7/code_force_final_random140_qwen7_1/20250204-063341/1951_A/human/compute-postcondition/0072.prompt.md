Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The `results` list will contain 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated for each input string `arr` over all iterations. For each iteration, `n` (an integer) and `arr` (a string) are read from input. The variable `count_ones` counts the number of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` is 0, 'yes' is appended to `results`. If `count_ones` is odd, 'no' is appended. If `count_ones` is exactly 2, 'no' is appended if '11' is in `arr`, otherwise 'yes' is appended. For any other even `count_ones`, 'yes' is appended if '11' is not in `arr`, otherwise 'no' is appended. After all iterations, `results` will contain the outcomes for each input string `arr` according to the specified conditions.
Code of the loop:
for r in results:
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `r` is the first element of `results`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is the second element of `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is the third element of `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
