Output State: **The `results` list will contain all the outcomes for each input string `arr` based on the specified conditions after all iterations of the loop have finished.**

To elaborate, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the `results` list will hold the final outcome ('yes' or 'no') for each input string `arr` processed according to the given conditions. Each condition checks the count of '1's in the string and whether the substring '11' exists, appending 'yes' or 'no' to the `results` list accordingly.
