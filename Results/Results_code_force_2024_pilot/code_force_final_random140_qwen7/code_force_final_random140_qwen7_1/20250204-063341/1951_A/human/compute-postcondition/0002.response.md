Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem states that `t` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than or equal to 1. If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `start`, `end`, and `results` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The problem does not specify any constraints on these variables for the loop to run, so we can leave them as given.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than or equal to 1.

**State:**
**`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list**
