Output State: **`count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `n` is the integer value of the input provided by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and the previous elements, and `count_ones` is updated to the count of '1's in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. The values of `count_ones`, `n`, `arr`, and `results` remain unchanged except that `results` now includes `'yes'`.
