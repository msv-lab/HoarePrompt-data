Output State: **`count_ones` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `results` is a list containing 'yes'**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. The values of `count_ones` and `n` remain unchanged, and `arr` also remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.
