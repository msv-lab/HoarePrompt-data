Output State: **`arr` is the input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` includes 'yes', and `count_ones` is updated to the number of '1's in `arr`.**

This means that the `results` list has been appended with the string `'yes'`, indicating that the substring `'11'` was found in `arr` when `count_ones` was even. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `count_ones` is now updated to reflect the current count of '1's in `arr`.
