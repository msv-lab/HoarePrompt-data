Output State: **`count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, and `count_ones` is less than 2; `results` contains 'yes'**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `count_ones`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `count_ones` is less than 2 also remains valid.
