Output State: **`count_ones` is 2, '11' is not in `arr`, and `results` contains 'yes'**.

The code appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Since `count_ones` was initially set to 2 and '11' was not in `arr`, these conditions remain unchanged. The list `results` now contains the element `'yes'`.
