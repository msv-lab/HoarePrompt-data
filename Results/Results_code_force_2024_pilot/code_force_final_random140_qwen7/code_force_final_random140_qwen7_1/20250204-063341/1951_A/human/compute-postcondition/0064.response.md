Output State: The final output state will be a list `results` containing 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated for each input string `arr` over all iterations of the loop.

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `results` will contain a list of strings ('yes' or 'no') corresponding to each input string `arr` processed during the loop. For each iteration, if the count of '1's in `arr` is 0, `results` will append 'yes'. If the count of '1's is odd, `results` will append 'no'. If the count of '1's is exactly 2, `results` will append 'yes' only if '11' is not present in `arr`; otherwise, it appends 'no'. For any other even count of '1's, `results` will append 'yes' if '11' is not present in `arr`, and 'no' if '11' is present. The final `results` list will reflect the outcome of these evaluations for all inputs provided through the loop.
