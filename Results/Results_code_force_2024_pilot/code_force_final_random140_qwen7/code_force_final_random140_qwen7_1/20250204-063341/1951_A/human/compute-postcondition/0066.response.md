To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the objects involved in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over the `results` list. Therefore, the only object in the loop head is `r`, which represents an element from the `results` list.

Given the description of the loop, the state of `results` is crucial because the loop body processes each element of `results`. However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `r`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `r`, which iterates over the `results` list.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `r`**: Since the loop starts with the first element of `results`, `r` should initially hold the first element of `results`.
3. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body processes each element of `results` based on specific conditions involving `count_ones` and the presence of '11' in `arr`.

Since the loop starts with the first element of `results`, we need to ensure that `r` is set to the first element of `results`.

**State:**
- `r` is the first element of `results`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

State: **`r` is the first element of `results`**
