Reasoning:

1. The given program `func()` is a standalone function that processes a series of inputs. It does not interact with any external files or directories, which means it is not related to the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function in the first part of the code.
2. The problem description asks to evaluate the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, but the provided `func()` function is completely separate and unrelated.
3. Since the `func()` function is not being used in the context of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, and there is no indication that the `func()` function's correctness needs to be evaluated in relation to the first function, we can only assess the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function based on its own logic.

Given the above points, since the `func()` function is not relevant to the evaluation of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, we need to focus solely on the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.

The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function appears to correctly:
- Get the current directory and list all subdirectories.
- Filter out only those subdirectories that match the naming convention (i.e., are digits within the specified range).
- For each matching subdirectory, it lists all `.html` files.
- For each `.html` file, it generates two new files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) and prints the results.

Based on the provided code, the logic seems correct for the task described.

Correctness: **True**
