Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the phone's charge is consumed by both keeping it on and turning it off multiple times between messages. Specifically, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3 10 1 5
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES". Here's why:

- At moment 0, the phone has 10 units of charge.
- Between moment 0 and moment 1, the phone is on for 1 unit of time, consuming `a * 1 = 1` unit of charge. So, the remaining charge is `10 - 1 = 9`.
- Between moment 1 and moment 2, the phone is on for 1 unit of time, consuming another `a * 1 = 1` unit of charge. So, the remaining charge is `9 - 1 = 8`.
- Between moment 2 and moment 3, the phone is on for 1 unit of time, consuming another `a * 1 = 1` unit of charge. So, the remaining charge is `8 - 1 = 7`.

The program checks the energy cost at each step and does not account for the fact that turning the phone off and on consumes additional charge. Specifically, the program should check if the remaining charge after each interval is sufficient to cover the energy cost of either keeping the phone on or turning it off and on, but it does not do this correctly.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the remaining charge after each interval is sufficient to cover the energy cost of either keeping the phone on or turning it off and on, and it should also handle the cumulative effect of these operations.
