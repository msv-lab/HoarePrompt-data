You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `possible` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, and `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]), b) for i in range(1, n+1))`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `possible` will be set to `False` because the condition `f <= energy_cost` was met at some point during the loop, causing the loop to break. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop runs from `1` to `n`. The `time_diff` will be the difference between `arr[n]` and `arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` will be `a` multiplied by `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` remains `b`, and `energy_cost` will be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Finally, `f` will be reduced by the sum of all `energy_cost` values over the iterations, which is the total energy consumed during the entire process.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then reads the list of times `arr` at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `True`.
   - It creates a list `arr` with an extra `0` at the beginning to handle the time difference calculation correctly.

3. **Loop Through Messages:**
   - The program iterates through each pair of consecutive message times.
   - For each pair, it calculates the time difference `time_diff` between the current and previous message times.
   - It then calculates the energy cost if the phone were kept on (`energy_keep_on`) and the energy cost if the phone were turned off and on (`energy_turn_off_on`).
   - The minimum of these two costs is used as the actual energy cost.
   - If the remaining charge `f` is less than or equal to this energy cost, the program sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Update Charge:**
   - The program subtracts the energy cost from the remaining charge `f`.

5. **Output Result:**
   - After processing all messages, the program prints `'YES'` if `possible` is still `True`, indicating that all messages can be sent. Otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Energy Calculation:**
   - The energy cost calculation is correct. The program correctly considers both the cost of keeping the phone on and the cost of turning it off and on.

2. **Charge Management:**
   - The program correctly updates the charge `f` after each message attempt.

3. **Break Condition:**
   - The program correctly breaks out of the loop and sets `possible` to `False` if the charge is insufficient to send a message, ensuring that no further messages can be sent.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the charge might drop to zero exactly at the time of sending a message by checking the remaining charge against the energy cost before performing the subtraction.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately determines whether Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero.
