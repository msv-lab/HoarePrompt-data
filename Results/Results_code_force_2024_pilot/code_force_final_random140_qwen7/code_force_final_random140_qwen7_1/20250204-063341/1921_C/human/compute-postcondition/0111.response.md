Output State: `possible` is False, `i` is `n`, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, and `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `possible` will be set to `False` because the loop breaks when `possible` is set to `False` on or before the third iteration. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` since the loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive. The value of `time_diff` will be `arr[n] - arr[n-1]` as it is computed in the last iteration. The `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on` will be calculated based on the last `time_diff`. The `energy_cost` will be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Finally, `f` will be reduced by the `energy_cost` of the last iteration.
