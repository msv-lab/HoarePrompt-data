Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is undefined, `time_diff` is undefined, `energy_keep_on` is undefined, `energy_turn_off_on` is undefined, `energy_cost` is undefined, `f` is an input integer, `possible` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes four space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. The initial values of `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, and `possible` remain unchanged and are still undefined.
