Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, and `possible` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `energy_keep_on` to `a * time_diff`. Given that `time_diff` is defined as `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, and initially `i` is 3, the updated `energy_keep_on` becomes `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
