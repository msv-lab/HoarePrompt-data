Output State: **`i` is 1; `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`; `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`; `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.**

The code assigns the value of `b` to the variable `energy_turn_off_on`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `time_diff`, and `energy_keep_on` remain unchanged.
