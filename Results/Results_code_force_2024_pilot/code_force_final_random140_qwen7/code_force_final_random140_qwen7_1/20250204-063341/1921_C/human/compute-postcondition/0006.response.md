Output State: **`i` is 1; `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` to the variable `time_diff`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `arr[i]` is `arr[1]` and `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[0]`. Therefore, `time_diff` is calculated as `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
