Output State: **`possible` is True, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`**

The code calculates the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]`, which results in `time_diff`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `time_diff` is set to `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The values of `possible` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
