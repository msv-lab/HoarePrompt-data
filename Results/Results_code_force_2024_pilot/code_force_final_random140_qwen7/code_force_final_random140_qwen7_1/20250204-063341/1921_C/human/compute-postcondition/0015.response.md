Output State: **`i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, and `possible` is `False`.**

The value of `f` is decreased by `energy_cost`, which is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
