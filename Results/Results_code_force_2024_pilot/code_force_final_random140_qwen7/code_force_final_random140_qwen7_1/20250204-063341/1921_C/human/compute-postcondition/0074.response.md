Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `time_diff` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_keep_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_turn_off_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_cost` is undefined because the loop has ended, `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(1, n + 1))`, and `possible` is `False`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be incremented beyond `n` (i.e., `i` becomes `n + 1`), and the loop conditions are no longer satisfied. Therefore, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` are undefined because the loop has ended. The value of `f` is updated by subtracting the total energy cost calculated over all iterations. The variable `possible` is set to `False` after the first iteration where `f` becomes less than or equal to the energy cost, and this state persists until the end of the loop.
