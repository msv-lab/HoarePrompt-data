Postcondition: `possible` is False, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, and either `f` is greater than `energy_cost` and we continue without breaking out of the loop, or `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
