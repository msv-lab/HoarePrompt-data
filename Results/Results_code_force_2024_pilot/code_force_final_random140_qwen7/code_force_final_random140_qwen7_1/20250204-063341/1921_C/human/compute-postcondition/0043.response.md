Output State: **`i` is 1; `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` to the variable `time_diff`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `time_diff` becomes `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it further.
