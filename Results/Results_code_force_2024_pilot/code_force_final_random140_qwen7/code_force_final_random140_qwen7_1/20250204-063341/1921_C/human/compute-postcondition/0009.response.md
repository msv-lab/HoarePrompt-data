Output State: **`i` is 1; `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`; `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`; `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`; `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`**.

This means that the variable `energy_cost` is assigned the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
