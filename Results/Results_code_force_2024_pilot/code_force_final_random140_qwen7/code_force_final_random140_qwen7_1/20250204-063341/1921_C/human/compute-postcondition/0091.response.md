Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `possible` is False
   - `i` is 1
   - `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`
   - `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`
   - `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`
   - `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`
   - `f` is decreased by `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, and `f` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, and `f` is decreased by `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`**
