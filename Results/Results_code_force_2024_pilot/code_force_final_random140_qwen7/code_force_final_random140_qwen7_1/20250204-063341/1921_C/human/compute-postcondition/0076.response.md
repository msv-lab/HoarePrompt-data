Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are defined:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `time_diff` is undefined
   - `energy_keep_on` is undefined
   - `energy_turn_off_on` is undefined
   - `energy_cost` is undefined
   - `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(1, n + 1))`
   - `possible` is `False`

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop has just completed an iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` should be decremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - All other variables (`i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, `f`, `possible`) remain undefined because the loop has ended, and the loop body does not redefine them.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` is now `t - 1`.
   - `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, `f`, and `possible` remain undefined.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `i` is undefined, `time_diff` is undefined, `energy_keep_on` is undefined, `energy_turn_off_on` is undefined, `energy_cost` is undefined, `f` is undefined, `possible` is undefined**.
