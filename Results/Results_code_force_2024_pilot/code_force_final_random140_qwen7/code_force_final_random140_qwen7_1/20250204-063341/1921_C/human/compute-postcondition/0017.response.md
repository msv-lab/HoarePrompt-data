Output State: **`i` is 2; `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`; `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`; `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`; `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`; `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`; `possible` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `time_diff` to `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `time_diff` is now `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The values of `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, `f`, and `possible` remain unchanged from their initial states.
