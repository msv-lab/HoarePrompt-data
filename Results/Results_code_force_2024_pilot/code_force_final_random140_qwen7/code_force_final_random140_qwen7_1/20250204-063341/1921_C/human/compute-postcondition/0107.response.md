Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, and `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables but simply exits the loop or condition. All the variables retain their initial values from the precondition.
