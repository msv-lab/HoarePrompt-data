Output State: **`possible` is True, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a * time_diff` to the variable `energy_keep_on`. Given that `time_diff` is initially set to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, the new value of `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`. The other variables (`possible`, `i`, and `time_diff`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
