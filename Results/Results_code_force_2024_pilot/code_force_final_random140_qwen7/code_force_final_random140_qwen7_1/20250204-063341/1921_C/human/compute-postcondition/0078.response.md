Output State: **`arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is undefined, `time_diff` is undefined, `energy_keep_on` is undefined, `energy_turn_off_on` is undefined, `energy_cost` is undefined, `possible` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` that starts with 0 followed by integers from the input. The values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Variables `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, and `possible` are not defined before and are not defined by the code, so they remain undefined.
