Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n, f, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9), and a list m of n integers sorted in ascending order (1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of several integers and a list. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific result for each test case without needing any additional parameters passed directly to it.
