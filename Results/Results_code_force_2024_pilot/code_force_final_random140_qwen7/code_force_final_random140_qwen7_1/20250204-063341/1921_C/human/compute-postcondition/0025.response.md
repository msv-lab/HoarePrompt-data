Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`. The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently `2`.
   - `time_diff` is calculated as `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`.
   - `energy_keep_on` is calculated as `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`.
   - `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.
   - `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`.
   - `f` is updated as `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)` - 1.
   - `possible` is `False`.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `3`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `3`.
   - All other variables (`time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, `f`, `possible`) will remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)` - 1, `possible` is `False`**.
