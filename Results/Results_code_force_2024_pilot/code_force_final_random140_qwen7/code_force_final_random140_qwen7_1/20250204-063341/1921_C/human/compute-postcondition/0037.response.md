Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive and ends there.
- `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` are undefined because the loop has ended.
- `f` is calculated as `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(1, n + 1))`, meaning it is reduced by the total cost of energy calculated during the loop.
- `possible` is `False` because the loop broke out on or before the third iteration due to the condition `f <= energy_cost` being met.

Given this, the `print` statement will evaluate the expression `'YES' if possible else 'NO'`. Since `possible` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
