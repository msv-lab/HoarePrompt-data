Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, and `f` is decreased by `b`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `energy_cost` to be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Given the initial conditions, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`. Therefore, `energy_cost` is now `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
