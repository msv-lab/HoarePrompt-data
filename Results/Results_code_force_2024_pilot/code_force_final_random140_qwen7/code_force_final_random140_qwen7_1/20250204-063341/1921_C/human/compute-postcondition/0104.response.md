Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, and `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`**

Explanation: The line `energy_turn_off_on = b` simply reassigns the value of `energy_turn_off_on` to `b`. Since `b` was already the value of `energy_turn_off_on` before this line, this assignment does not change the value of any variable. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
