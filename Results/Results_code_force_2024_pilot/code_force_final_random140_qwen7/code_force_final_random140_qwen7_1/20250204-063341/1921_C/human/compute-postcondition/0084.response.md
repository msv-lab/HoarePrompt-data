Output State: **`possible` is True, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on` to `energy_cost`. Since `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])` and `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` will take the smaller of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
