Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, and `possible` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, the `break` statement itself does not change the values of any variables. It simply exits the current context, which could be a loop or a conditional block. The values of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.
