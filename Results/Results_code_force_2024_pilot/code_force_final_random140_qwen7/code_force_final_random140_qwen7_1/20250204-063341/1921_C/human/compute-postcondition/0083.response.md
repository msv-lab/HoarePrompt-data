Output State: **`possible` is True, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`**.

The code assigns the value of `b` to the variable `energy_turn_off_on`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `possible`, `i`, `time_diff`, and `energy_keep_on` remain unchanged.
