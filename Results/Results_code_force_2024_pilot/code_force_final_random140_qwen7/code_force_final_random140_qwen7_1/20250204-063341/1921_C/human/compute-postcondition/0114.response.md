Output State: `possible` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, and `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(1, n + 1))`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `possible` will be set to `False` because the condition `f <= energy_cost` was met at some point during the loop, causing the loop to break. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop runs from `1` to `n`. The `time_diff` will be the difference between `arr[n]` and `arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` will be `a` multiplied by `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` remains `b`, and `energy_cost` will be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Finally, `f` will be reduced by the sum of all `energy_cost` values over the iterations, which is equivalent to `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(1, n + 1))`.
