State: **`possible` is True, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 1 and `n` must be greater than 0.
- The initial state of `possible` being True does not directly affect the loop's execution condition but might be relevant to the loop body. Therefore, it is included in the state for completeness.

Thus, the required adjustments are to set `i` to 1 and ensure `n` is greater than 0.
