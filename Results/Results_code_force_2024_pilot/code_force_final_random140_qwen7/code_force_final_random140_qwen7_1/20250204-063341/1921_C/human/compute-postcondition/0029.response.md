Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b)` - 1, `possible` is `False`, `energy_cost` is recalculated as `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`**

Explanation: The code updates `energy_cost` to be the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Given the initial conditions, `energy_cost` was already defined as `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b)`. Since `energy_cost` is being reassigned to its own minimum value, the value of `energy_cost` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.
