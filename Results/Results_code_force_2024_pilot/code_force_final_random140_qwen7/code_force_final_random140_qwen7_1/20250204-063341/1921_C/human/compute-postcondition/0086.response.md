Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, the value of `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`**.

The value of `possible` is explicitly set to `False`, while the values of `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
