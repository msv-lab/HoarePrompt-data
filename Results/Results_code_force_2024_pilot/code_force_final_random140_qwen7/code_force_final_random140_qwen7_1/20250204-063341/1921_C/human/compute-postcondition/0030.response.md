Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b)` - 1, `possible` is `False`**

Explanation: The line `possible = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `possible`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
