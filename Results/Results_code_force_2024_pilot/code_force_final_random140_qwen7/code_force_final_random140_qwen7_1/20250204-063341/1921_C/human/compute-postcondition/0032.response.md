Postcondition: `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b)` - 1, `possible` is `False`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`.
