Output State: **`i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `b`**

Explanation: The code `energy_turn_off_on = b` simply reassigns the value of `energy_turn_off_on` to `b`. Since `b` was already the value of `energy_turn_off_on` before this line, the assignment does not change the actual value stored in `energy_turn_off_on`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
