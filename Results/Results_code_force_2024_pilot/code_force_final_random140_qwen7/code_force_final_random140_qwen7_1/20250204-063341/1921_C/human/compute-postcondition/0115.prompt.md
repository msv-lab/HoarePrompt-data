Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    possible = True
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
        energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
        energy_turn_off_on = b
        energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
        if f <= energy_cost:
            possible = False
            break
        f -= energy_cost
    print('YES' if possible else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is `n`, `time_diff` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_keep_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_turn_off_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_cost` is undefined because the loop has ended, `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(1, n + 1))`, and `possible` is `False`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive. The variables `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` are no longer relevant since the loop has finished executing. The value of `f` will be reduced by the total cost of energy calculated as the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each iteration, minus one additional unit due to the decrement operation in the loop. Finally, `possible` remains `False` because the condition `f <= energy_cost` was met and the loop broke out on or before the third iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `time_diff` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_keep_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_turn_off_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_cost` is undefined because the loop has ended, `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(1, n + 1))`, and `possible` is `False`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be incremented beyond `n` (i.e., `i` becomes `n + 1`), and the loop conditions are no longer satisfied. Therefore, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` are undefined because the loop has ended. The value of `f` is updated by subtracting the total energy cost calculated over all iterations. The variable `possible` is set to `False` after the first iteration where `f` becomes less than or equal to the energy cost, and this state persists until the end of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `possible` is False, `i` is `n`, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, and `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `possible` will be set to `False` because the condition `f <= energy_cost` was met at some point during the loop, causing the loop to break. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop runs from `1` to `n`. The `time_diff` will be the difference between `arr[n]` and `arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` will be `a` multiplied by `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` remains `b`, and `energy_cost` will be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Finally, `f` will be reduced by the value of `energy_cost` for each iteration, resulting in `f` being decreased by the sum of all `energy_cost` values over the iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
