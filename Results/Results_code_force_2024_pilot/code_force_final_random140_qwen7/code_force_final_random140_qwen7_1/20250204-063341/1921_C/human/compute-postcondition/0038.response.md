State: **`i` is `n`, `time_diff` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_keep_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_turn_off_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_cost` is undefined because the loop has ended, `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(1, n + 1))`, and `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - 1`**.

### Explanation:
- The loop runs from `0` to `t - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- Since the loop has ended, the variables `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` are no longer relevant and remain undefined.
- The value of `f` is updated based on the sum of the minimum values calculated within the loop.
- The variable `possible` remains `False` because the loop exited based on the condition `f <= energy_cost`.
- The variable `t` is decremented by 1 to reflect the completion of one iteration of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would include `t` being decremented by 1.
