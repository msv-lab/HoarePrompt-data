Postcondition: `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, and `possible` is `False`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
