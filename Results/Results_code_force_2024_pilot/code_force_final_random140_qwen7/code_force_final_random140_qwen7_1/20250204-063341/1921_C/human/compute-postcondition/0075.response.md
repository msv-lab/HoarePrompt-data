Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:

- `i` is `n + 1`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` are undefined because the loop has ended.
- `f` is updated by subtracting the total energy cost calculated over all iterations.
- `possible` is `False` after the first iteration where `f` becomes less than or equal to the energy cost, and this state persists until the end of the loop.

Given these details, the expression `'YES' if possible else 'NO'` will evaluate to `'NO'` because `possible` is `False`.

Output: **NO**
