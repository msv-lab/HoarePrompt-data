Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the game's final score based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
2. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
3. The provided code does not correctly simulate the game according to the rules. Specifically:
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, but the code only considers the frequency of elements in `a`.
   - Bob always removes an element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The logic in the code does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
   - The code assumes that the optimal strategy involves finding the highest unique integer in the array, which is not correct for the described game.

Given these points, the provided code does not accurately simulate the game as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
