Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice can choose any element from `a` and append it to `c`.
   - Bob can only delete elements from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The MEX of `c` is determined by the missing smallest non-negative integer.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should aim to include the smallest numbers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should aim to prevent Alice from including the smallest numbers in `c`.

4. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It uses a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the array.
   - It iterates through the range `[0, n)` and checks the counts:
     - If `i` is not in `arr`, it sets `ans` to `i`.
     - If `i` appears exactly once and `once` is `False`, it sets `ans` to `i + 1` and marks `once` as `True`.
     - If `i` appears exactly once and `once` is already `True`, it sets `ans` to `i`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the code does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The code does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
   - The code assumes that the first occurrence of a unique number determines the MEX, which is not always correct given the alternating turns.

6. **Correct Solution**:
   - Alice should aim to include the smallest numbers first.
   - Bob should aim to prevent Alice from including the smallest numbers by deleting them.
   - The optimal strategy involves Alice and Bob making choices based on the current state of the array and the turns taken.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
