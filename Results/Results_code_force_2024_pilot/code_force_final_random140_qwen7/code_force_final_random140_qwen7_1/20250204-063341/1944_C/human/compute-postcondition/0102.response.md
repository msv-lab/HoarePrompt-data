Postcondition: `once` is either False or True, `ans` is 1, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`, then `once` becomes True. Otherwise, `once` remains False.
