Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arr:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is set to `n-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers created from user input.
   - `n` is the length of `arr`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`. For the loop to start, `arr` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to `n-1`, it means that initially, `i` points to the last element of `arr`.
   - The loop will start executing as soon as `arr` contains at least one element. Therefore, `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must have at least one element.
- `i` should be initialized to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.

So, the final state after adjusting is:

**State: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr`**
