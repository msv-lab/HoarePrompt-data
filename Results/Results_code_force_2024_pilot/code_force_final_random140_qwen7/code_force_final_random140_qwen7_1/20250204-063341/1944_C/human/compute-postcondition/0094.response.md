Postcondition: `once` is False, `ans` is 0, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `arr`. If the frequency of the current element (`arr[i]`) is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the frequency of the current element (`arr[i]`) is exactly 1, we either update `once` to True and set `ans` to `i + 1`, or maintain the original state where `once` is False and `ans` is 0.
