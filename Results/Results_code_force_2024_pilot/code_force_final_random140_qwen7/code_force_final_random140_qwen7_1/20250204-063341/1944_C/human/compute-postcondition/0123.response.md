Based on the initial state provided:

- `once` is either `True` or `False`.
- `ans` is either the highest unique element's value plus one or the highest unique element's value.
- `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `n` is the length of `arr`.

Given these conditions, the value of `ans` will depend on the highest unique element in `arr` and whether there is any element with a frequency of 1 before encountering an element with a frequency of 0. If there is no element with a frequency of 1, then `ans` will be the highest unique element's value. If there is at least one element with a frequency of 1, then `ans` will be the highest unique element's value plus one.

Since the exact values of the elements in `arr` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` will be either the highest unique element's value or the highest unique element's value plus one.

Output: **ans (where ans is the highest unique element's value plus one if such an element exists, otherwise it is the highest unique element's value)**
