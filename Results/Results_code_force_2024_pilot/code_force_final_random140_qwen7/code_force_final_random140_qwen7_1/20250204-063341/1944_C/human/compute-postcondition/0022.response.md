Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; the counter at index `i` is equal to 1; `once` is true; `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, `ans` becomes 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, the counter at index `i`, and `once`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
