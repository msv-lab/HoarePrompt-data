Output State: **`ans` is 0, `once` is False, `counter` dictionary contains each unique element from the list `arr` as a key, with the corresponding value being the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`.**

The variable `ans` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `once` is set to `False`. The `counter` dictionary, which was initialized to keep track of the frequency of elements in the list `arr`, remains unaffected by this line of code.
