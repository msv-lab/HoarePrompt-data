Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in arr`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `counter` is a dictionary with key `n-1` and value 1.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be an element of `arr`.
   - Since `i` is currently set to `n-1`, the loop will execute if `n-1` is an element of `arr`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will change to the next element in `arr` during the next iteration.
   - `arr` remains the same unless modified within the loop body.
   - `counter` is not directly affected by the loop head and its state does not need to be adjusted here.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `arr` (if it exists).
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `counter` remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, the new state should reflect that `i` will be the next element in `arr` (if it exists), and `arr` and `counter` remain the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is a different element in `arr`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `counter` is a dictionary with key `n-1` and value 1**
