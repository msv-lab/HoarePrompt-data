Output State: The `counter` dictionary will contain each unique element from the list `arr` as a key, with the corresponding value being the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`. This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `counter` will have been updated such that for every integer `i` in `arr`, `counter[i]` will reflect the total frequency of `i` in the entire list `arr`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `counter` will show how many times each number in the original list `arr` appeared, summed up over all elements in `arr`.
