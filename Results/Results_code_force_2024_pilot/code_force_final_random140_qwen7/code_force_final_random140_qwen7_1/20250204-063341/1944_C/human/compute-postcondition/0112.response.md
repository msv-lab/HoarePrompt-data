Output State: **`once` is True, `ans` is 4, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `arr`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is 3, so when `ans = i + 1` is executed, `ans` is assigned the value of `3 + 1`, which is `4`. The other variables (`once`, `counter`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
