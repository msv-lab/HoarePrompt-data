Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user that must be in the range [1, 20000], `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list `arr` by taking a space-separated string of integers as input using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings, and then `map(int, ...)` converts each string in the list to an integer. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
