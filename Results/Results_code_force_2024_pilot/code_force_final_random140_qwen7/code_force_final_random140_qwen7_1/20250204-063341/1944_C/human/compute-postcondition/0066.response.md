Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in arr:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `counter` is an empty dictionary (not relevant for this adjustment).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n-1`, it doesn't directly affect whether the loop can execute. However, we need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element.
   - We don't need to adjust `i` because it will be reassigned within the loop to each element of `arr`.

Therefore, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `arr` contains at least one element.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `counter` is an empty dictionary**
