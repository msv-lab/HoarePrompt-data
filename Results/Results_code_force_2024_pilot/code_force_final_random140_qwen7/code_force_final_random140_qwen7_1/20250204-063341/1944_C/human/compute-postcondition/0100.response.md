Output State: **`once` is False, `ans` is 1, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `arr`**

Explanation: The code sets `ans` to the value of `i`, which was initially 1. So, `ans` becomes 1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables (`once`, `counter`, `n`) remain unchanged.
