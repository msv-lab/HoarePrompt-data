Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `counter[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` exists in `counter`, otherwise it is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the `counter` dictionary by incrementing the count of the key `i` by 1. If `i` does not exist in `counter`, it is initialized with a value of 0 before incrementing. The initial state of `arr` is unchanged, but now `counter[i]` is updated based on whether `i` was already a key in `counter` or not.
