Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement when `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1, or there is no change in the state since there is no else part and the condition `counter.get(i, 0) != 1` or `once` being True initially holds true.
