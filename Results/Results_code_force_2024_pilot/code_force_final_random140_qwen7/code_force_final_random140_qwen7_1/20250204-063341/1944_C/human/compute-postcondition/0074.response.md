Output State: **`ans` is 0, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is the last element processed in `arr`, `arr` and `n` remain as they were initially.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `counter`, `i`, `arr`, or `n`. After the loop has executed all its iterations, `counter` contains the count of each unique element in `arr`, `i` is the last element processed in `arr`, and `arr` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
