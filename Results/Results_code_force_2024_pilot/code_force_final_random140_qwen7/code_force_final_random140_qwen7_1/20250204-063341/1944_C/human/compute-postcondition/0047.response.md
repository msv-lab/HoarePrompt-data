Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - Either `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `ans` is 2 and `once` is True.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(n)`.
   - This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Possible Transitions:**
   - If `i` is incremented to 2 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration), the loop will continue if `n > 2`.
   - If `i` becomes 2, the loop will check the condition `i < n` again.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust these two variables.
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2.

6. **Postconditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

7. **Additional Considerations:**
   - The postcondition about `ans` and `once` does not change based on the loop iteration itself but rather on the logic inside the loop body. These conditions are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
