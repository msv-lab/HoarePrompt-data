Output State: **`once` is False, `ans` is 0, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `once`, `ans`, `counter`, `i`, or `n`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in.
