Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or 2, `once` is either False or True, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 0, then `ans` is 1, `once` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented to 2. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to 2 and `once` is set to True. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1, `once` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented to 2.
