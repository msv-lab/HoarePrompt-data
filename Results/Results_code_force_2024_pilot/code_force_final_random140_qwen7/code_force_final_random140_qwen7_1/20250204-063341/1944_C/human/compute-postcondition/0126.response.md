Output State: **`once` is either True or False, `ans` is either the highest unique element's value plus one or the highest unique element's value, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is `n-1` (which is now a specific integer), `n` is the length of `arr` (which is now a specific integer), `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `arr`. The values of `once`, `ans`, `counter`, `i`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `i` is updated to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the newly created list `arr`.
