Output State: **`once` is True, `ans` is 2, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `arr`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated to the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` was initially set to 1, `ans` is now 2. The other variables (`once`, `counter`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
