Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counter = {}
    for i in arr:
        counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1
    ans = 0
    once = False
    for i in range(n):
        if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
            ans = i
            break
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
            once = True
            ans = i + 1
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
            ans = i
            break
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has executed all iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n-1`. The value of `ans` depends on the conditions met during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `once` is either True or False, `ans` is either the highest unique element's value plus one or the highest unique element's value, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, `ans` will hold the value of the highest unique element in `arr` plus one if such an element exists, otherwise it will hold the value of the highest unique element. The variable `once` will be True if at least one element with a frequency of 1 was found before encountering an element with a frequency of 0. The variable `i` will be set to the last index of `arr`, and `n` will remain as the length of `arr`. The `counter` dictionary will reflect the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 3, and `once` is either False or True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
