Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `ans`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional context that was previously set up. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
