Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user that must be in the range [1, 20000], `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer input from the user that must be in the range [1, 20000].
