Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `counter` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `counter`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
