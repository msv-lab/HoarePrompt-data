Output State: **`ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `ans`, `once`, `i`, `n`, or the condition `counter.get(i, 0)`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
