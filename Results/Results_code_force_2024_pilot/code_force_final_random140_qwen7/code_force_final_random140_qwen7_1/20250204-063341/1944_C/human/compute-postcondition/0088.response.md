Output State: **`once` is False, `ans` is 0, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
