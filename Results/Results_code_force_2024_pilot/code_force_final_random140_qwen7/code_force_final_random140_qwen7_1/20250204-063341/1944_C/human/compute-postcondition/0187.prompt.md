Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `once` is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `once` is either False or True, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1 and `once` was initially False, `once` becomes True. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or 2, `once` is either False or True, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 0, then `ans` is 1, `once` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented to 2. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to 2 and `once` is set to True. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1, `once` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` remains 3. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is set to 4. If `counter.get(i, 0)` does not equal 1, then `ans` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
