Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the variable `ams` is assigned within the loop but never used, and the final value of `ans` is not updated based on the number of groups of `k` cards found. This means the program will always output the initial value of `ans`, which is `n`, without considering the possibility of reducing the number of cards through the described operations.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
The expected output is 2, as shown in the problem description. However, the program will output 5 because it does not update `ans` based on the number of groups of `k` cards found.

To fix this, the program should update `ans` based on the number of groups of `k` cards found and subtract the appropriate number of cards from `ans`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        h = {}
        ans = n
        for i in a:
            if i in h:
                h[i] += 1
            else:
                h[i] = 1
            if h[i] >= k:
                ans -= (h[i] // k) * (k - 1)
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version properly updates `ans` based on the number of groups of `k` cards found, ensuring the minimum number of cards left is calculated correctly.
