Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The program does not actually perform the operations as described. It simply counts the occurrences of each card and does not simulate the process of exchanging cards.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Cards**: The logic to calculate the minimum number of cards left is flawed. For example, it does not handle the case where multiple groups of `k` cards can be formed and exchanged optimally.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging cards. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the occurrences of each card
        count = {}
        for card in a:
            if card in count:
                count[card] += 1
            else:
                count[card] = 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
        min_cards = 0
        for freq in count.values():
            min_cards += (freq + k - 1) // k * (k - 1)
        
        print(min_cards)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Count Occurrences**: We count how many times each card appears.
2. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: For each group of cards, we calculate how many cards can be left after performing the operations. Specifically, `(freq + k - 1) // k * (k - 1)` gives the number of cards that can be left after exchanging groups of `k` cards.

This approach ensures that we correctly simulate the process and compute the minimum number of cards left.
