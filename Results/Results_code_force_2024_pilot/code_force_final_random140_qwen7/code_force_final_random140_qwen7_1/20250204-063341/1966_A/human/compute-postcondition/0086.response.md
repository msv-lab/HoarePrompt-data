Postcondition: `h` is a dictionary where if `i` is in `h`, then `h[i]` is set to `2`, and if `i` is not in `h`, then `h` has one key-value pair `{i: 1}`. `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is equal to `n`, and `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element `i`. The current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.
