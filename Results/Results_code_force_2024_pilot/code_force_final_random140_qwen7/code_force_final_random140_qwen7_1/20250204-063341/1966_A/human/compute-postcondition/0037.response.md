Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is equal to `k - 1`.
- `_` is an integer value between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (the list must contain at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop).
- `h` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to each element of `a` is incremented by 1 if it already exists, otherwise it is added as a new key with the value 1, and the value of `h[i]` for each `i` in `a` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, making `h[i]` greater than or equal to `k` for every `i` in `a`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(ans)
```

Given that `ans` is explicitly stated to be equal to `k - 1`, the print statement will simply output this value.

Output: **k - 1**
