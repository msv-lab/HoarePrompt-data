Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the second element of `a`, and `h[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `h[i] += 1` increments the value of `h[i]` by 1, where `i` is the second element of the list `a`. The initial state of `a` being a non-empty list of integers and `i` being the second element of `a` remains unchanged, but the value of `h[i]` is updated.
