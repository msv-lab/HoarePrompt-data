Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of `a`, `h` is a dictionary where the value of `h[i]` is 1.**

The code `h[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `i` in the dictionary `h`. Since `i` is the third element of the list `a`, the dictionary `h` now has the key `i` with the value 1. All other elements of the list `a` and the dictionary `h` remain unchanged from their initial state.
