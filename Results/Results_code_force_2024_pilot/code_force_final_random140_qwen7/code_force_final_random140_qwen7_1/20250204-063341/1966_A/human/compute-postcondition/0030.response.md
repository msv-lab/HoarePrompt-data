Output State: **`ans` is equal to `k - 1`, `_` is an integer value between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (must contain at least three elements), `h` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the first element of `a` is incremented by 1 if it already exists, otherwise it is added as a new key with the value 1, and the key corresponding to the third element of `a` is incremented by 1 if it already exists, otherwise it is added as a new key with the value 1, `i` is the third element of `a`, `h[i]` is set to 1.**

In this output state, the dictionary `h` has its key corresponding to the third element of `a` set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
