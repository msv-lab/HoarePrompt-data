Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 500.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arrC = list(map(int, input().split()))
    hashmap = {}
    ans = n
    for i in arrC:
        if i in hashmap:
            hashmap[i] += 1
        else:
            hashmap[i] = 1
        if hashmap[i] >= k:
            ans = k - 1
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is decreased by 1, all elements in `arrC` have been processed, and for each unique element `i` in `arrC`, the value of `hashmap[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `arrC`. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `hashmap` will map each unique element `i` from `arrC` to its count in the list; if any element's count in `hashmap` reaches or exceeds `k`, `ans` will be set to `k - 1`; `t` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The loop has executed for all elements in `arrC`. After all iterations, `hashmap` contains the count of each integer in `arrC`, but capped at `k - 1` if they exceed `k`. The value of `ans` remains as `k - 1` throughout all iterations and does not change; `t` is now `t - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
