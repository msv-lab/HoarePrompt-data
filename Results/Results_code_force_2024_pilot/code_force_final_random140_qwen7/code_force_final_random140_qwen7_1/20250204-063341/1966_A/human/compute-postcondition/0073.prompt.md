Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is an integer value between 1 and 500 (inclusive) plus 1, `n` and `k` are now integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `h` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to each element of `a` is incremented by 1 if it already exists, otherwise it is added as a new key with the value 1, and the value of `h[i]` for each `i` in `a` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, making `h[i]` greater than or equal to `k` for every `i` in `a`, and `h` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the first element of `a`, and `h[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `h`, or set to 1 if `i` is not in `h`. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `h[i]` is decremented by 1. If `h[i]` is less than `k`, then `h[i]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, and `i` is the second element of `a`. If `i` is in `h` and `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `h[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `h` or `h[i]` is less than `k`, then `h[i]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of `a`, and `h` is a dictionary. If the third element `i` of `a` is in `h` and its value is incremented by 1, otherwise the value of `h[i]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
