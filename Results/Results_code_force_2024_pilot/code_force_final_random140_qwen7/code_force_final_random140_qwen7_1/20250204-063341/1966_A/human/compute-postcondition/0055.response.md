Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the first element of `a`, and `h[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `h`, or set to 1 if `i` is not in `h`. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `h[i]` is decremented by 1. If `h[i]` is less than `k`, then `h[i]` remains unchanged.
