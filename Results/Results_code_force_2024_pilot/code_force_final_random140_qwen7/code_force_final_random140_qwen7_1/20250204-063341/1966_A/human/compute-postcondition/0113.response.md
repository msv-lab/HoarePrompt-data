Output State: **After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and `ans` will be `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times during any iteration, otherwise `ans` will remain `n`.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `t` starts at a positive integer (since it's initially assigned the value of an integer input between 1 and 500) and decreases by 1 with each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0.
- During each iteration, the loop processes the array `arrC` and updates the `hashmap` to count the occurrences of each element. If any element's count in `hashmap` reaches or exceeds `k`, `ans` is set to `k - 1`. This value of `ans` persists for the rest of the iterations and does not change further, unless another element's count reaches `k` again.
- Therefore, the final value of `ans` will be `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times at any point during the loop, and `n` otherwise.
