Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be given out. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the chosen vertices are consecutive. For example, consider the input:

```
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```

The program should output `2` because the vertices 1, 2, 5, and 6 can form two non-intersecting triangles (1-2-5 and 2-5-6). However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of triangles as follows:

1. It sorts the vertices: `[1, 2, 5, 6]`.
2. It adds `n + arr[0]` to the end of the array: `[1, 2, 5, 6, 8]`.
3. It calculates the number of triangles as `x - 2`: `4 - 2 = 2`.

This calculation is correct in this specific case, but the program fails to handle cases where the chosen vertices are not sorted in a way that allows it to correctly count the triangles. For instance, if the vertices were `1, 5, 2, 6`, the program would still output `2`, which is incorrect because the correct number of triangles would be `3` (1-2-5, 2-5-6, and 1-5-6).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the vertices are sorted and then check for consecutive pairs to maximize the number of triangles.
