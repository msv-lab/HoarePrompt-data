Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) (with specific constraints), and a list of \( x \) distinct integers representing vertices. It then calculates and prints the number of gaps of size 2 between consecutive elements in the sorted list of vertices, starting from the first element and wrapping around to the last element. The function returns nothing but prints the result for each test case.**
