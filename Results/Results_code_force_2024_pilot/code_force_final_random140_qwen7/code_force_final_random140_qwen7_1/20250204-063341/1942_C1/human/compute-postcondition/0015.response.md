Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments until it reaches `x + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` must be at least `1`.
   - `i` is the current index of the loop, and it will be incremented at each iteration.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `x + 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been `x`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `x + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `x + 1`.
   - `x` remains unchanged because there is no indication that `x` should change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` must be at least 1, `i` is `x + 1`**
