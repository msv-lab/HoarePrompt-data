Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, the array `arr` has at least two elements such that the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is 2; `ans` is incremented by 1.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The conditions and values of `x` and `arr` remain unchanged from the initial state.
