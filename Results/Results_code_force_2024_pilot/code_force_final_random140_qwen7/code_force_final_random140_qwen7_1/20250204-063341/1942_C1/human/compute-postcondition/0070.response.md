Output State: The loop will continue to increment `i` from `x + 1` up to `x + t`, checking if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`. For each iteration where this condition is true, `ans` will be incremented by 1. After all iterations, `i` will be `x + t + 1`, `x` will remain unchanged, and `ans` will be the total count of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was met during the loop's execution.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be set to `x + t + 1`, `x` will stay the same, and `ans` will hold the total number of times the difference between consecutive elements in the array `arr` equals 2.
