Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer from the input split, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into multiple parts (assuming there are spaces between the inputs), and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` in order. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
