Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended, `i` is less than `x + 1`, `ans` is `x - 1`, and `t` is greater than 0. The difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially set to `x - 2`. After executing `ans += 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1, making its value `x - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
