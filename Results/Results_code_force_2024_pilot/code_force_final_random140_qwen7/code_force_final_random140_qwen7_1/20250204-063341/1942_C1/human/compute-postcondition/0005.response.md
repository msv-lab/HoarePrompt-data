Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer from the input split, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split; `arr` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
