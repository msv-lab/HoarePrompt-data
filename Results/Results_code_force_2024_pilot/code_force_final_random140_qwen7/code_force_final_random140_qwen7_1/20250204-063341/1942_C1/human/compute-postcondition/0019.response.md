Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and goes up to `x + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `x + 1`.
   - `ans` is increased by 1 if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` equals 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - Since `i` is `x + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute because the loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`, but `i` is already `x + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop does not execute, there are no changes to `i` or `ans` from the previous iteration.
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `x`, as it must still satisfy the condition of being at least 1.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should remain the same as the postcondition of the previous iteration.

**State: **`x` must be at least 1, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` equals 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
