Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `n + arr[0]` is appended to `arr`, making it a sorted list of integers with one additional element.
- `i` is set to `x + 1`.
- `ans` is set to `x + 1`.
- `t` is still greater than 0 (though this last piece of information is not needed to determine the output of the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(ans)
```

Given that `ans` is explicitly stated to be `x + 1`, the print statement will output the value of `x + 1`.

Output: **x + 1**
