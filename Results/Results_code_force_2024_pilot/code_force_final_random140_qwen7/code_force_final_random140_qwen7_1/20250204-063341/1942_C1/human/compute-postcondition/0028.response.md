Output State: **`arr` is a list of input strings, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `int(arr[i]) - int(arr[i - 1])` equals 2, and `t` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `i` is updated to `x + 1`. The condition for incrementing `ans` remains the same, but since the actual values of the elements in `arr` are not known, we cannot specify the exact number of times `ans` will be incremented.
