Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, it processes three integers n, x, and y (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0). The vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function also ensures that the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The function returns information based on the processed test cases.**
