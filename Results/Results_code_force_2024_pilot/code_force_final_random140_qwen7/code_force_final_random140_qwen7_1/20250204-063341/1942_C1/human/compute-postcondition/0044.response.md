Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended, `i` is `i + 2`, `ans` is `x + 1` or `x`, and `t` is still greater than 0.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `x + 1` or `x` based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`. Since the exact value of `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is not given, `ans` could be either `x + 1` or `x`.
