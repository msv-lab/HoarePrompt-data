Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended, `i` is less than `x + 1`, `ans` is `x`, and `t` is greater than 0. `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was equal to `x - 1`. After incrementing, `ans` becomes `x`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
