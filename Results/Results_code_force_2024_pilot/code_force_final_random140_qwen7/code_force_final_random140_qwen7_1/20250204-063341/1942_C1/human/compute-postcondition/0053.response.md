Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer value of the corresponding string in the original list up to index `x`; `i` is `x + 1`; `ans` is `x + 1`; `t` is `t - 1`; `[n, x, y]` are integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code converts the first `x` elements of the list `arr` (which initially contains strings) into integers and assigns them back to `arr`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `[n, x, y]` are updated to the new values obtained from the input.
