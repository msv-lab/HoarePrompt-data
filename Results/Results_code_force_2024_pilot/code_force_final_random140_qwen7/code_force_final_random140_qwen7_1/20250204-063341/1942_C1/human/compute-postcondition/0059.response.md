Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `arr`, and `ans` is increased by 1.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since the initial conditions state that `arr` is a list of integers and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2, these conditions remain unchanged. The only variable that has been modified is `ans`, which is now one greater than its previous value.
