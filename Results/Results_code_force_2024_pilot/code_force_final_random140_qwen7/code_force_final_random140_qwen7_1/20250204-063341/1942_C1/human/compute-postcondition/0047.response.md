Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is `x + 1`, and `t` is still greater than 0.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `x + 1` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `x`. For each iteration where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is met, `ans` is incremented by 1. Since the loop executes up to `x` times, and assuming the condition is met at least once (as per the given outputs), `ans` will end up being `x + 1`. The other variables (`arr`, `t`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
