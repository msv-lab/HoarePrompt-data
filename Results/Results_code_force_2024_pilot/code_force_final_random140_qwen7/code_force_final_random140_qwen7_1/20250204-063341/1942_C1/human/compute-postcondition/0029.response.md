Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `int(arr[i]) - int(arr[i - 1])` equals 2, and `t` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code changes the type of elements in the list `arr` from strings to integers using a list comprehension. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was defined as `x + 1`. The variable `ans` is still incremented by 1 for each occurrence where the difference between consecutive elements (converted to integers) is 2. The condition that `t` is greater than 0 is also still valid.
