Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is `x - 2`, and `t` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = x - 2` assigns the value of `x - 2` to the variable `ans`. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
