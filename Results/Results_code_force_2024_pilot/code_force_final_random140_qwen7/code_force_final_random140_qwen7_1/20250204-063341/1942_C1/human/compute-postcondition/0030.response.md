Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `int(arr[i]) - int(arr[i - 1])` equals 2, and `t` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The `arr.sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The sorted list `arr` replaces the original list. The condition for incrementing `ans` remains the same: `ans` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence where the difference between consecutive elements (after sorting) is exactly 2.
