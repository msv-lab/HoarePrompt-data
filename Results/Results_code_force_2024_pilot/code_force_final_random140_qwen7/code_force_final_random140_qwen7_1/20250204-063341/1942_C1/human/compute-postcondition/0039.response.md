Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended.
   - `i` is less than `x + 1`.
   - `ans` is `x - 1`.
   - `t` is greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `x`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

4. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is 2, then no change is made to `ans`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `x` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

6. **Post-Iteration State:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `ans` and `t` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no changes are mentioned, they stay the same.

Given the above analysis, the state adjustments are as follows:

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended, `i` is less than `x + 1`, `ans` is `x - 1`, and `t` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.**

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended, `i` is less than `x + 1`, `ans` is `x - 1`, and `t` is greater than 0. `i` is `i + 1`.**
