Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments until it reaches `x + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `arr`, and `ans` is increased by `1` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` equals `2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration.
   - The variable `x` does not change within the loop; it is a constant defined before the loop.
   - The variable `arr` and `ans` are not directly modified by the loop itself but depend on the values inside the loop.

5. **Calculate the new state**:
   - Since `i` was within the bounds of `arr` in the previous iteration, it will be incremented by `1` for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop itself.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `x` remains the same.
- `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not provided, let's denote it as `i_end`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_end + 1` (where `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), `x` is the same as before, and `ans` is the same as before.**
