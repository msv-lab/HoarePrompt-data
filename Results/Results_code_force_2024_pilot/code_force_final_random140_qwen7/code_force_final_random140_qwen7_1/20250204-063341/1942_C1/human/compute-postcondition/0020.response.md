Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and retains the conditions for `x` and `i`.
