Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t > 0`.

3. **Current state before the loop**: The state given is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute the first time**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `t > 0` must be true. Since `t` is already constrained to be between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), it is guaranteed that `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for the state since the current constraints on `t` already satisfy the loop condition.

**Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
