Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be `x + 1`, `x` will remain the same as it was initially, and `ans` will be the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was true during the loop's execution.

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will always be `x + 1` because it increments with each iteration and does not decrement. The variable `x` will retain its initial value since it is not modified within the loop. The variable `ans` will hold the total count of occurrences where the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array `arr` is exactly 2, starting from the second element to the last but one element (i.e., from `arr[1]` to `arr[x-1]`). This count is calculated based on the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the specified condition is met during the loop's execution.
