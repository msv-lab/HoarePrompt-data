Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers where each element is the integer value of the corresponding string in the original list up to index `x`; `i` is `x + 1`; `ans` is `x + 1`; `t` is `t - 1`; `[n, x, y]` are integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr`. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `t`, and the list `[n, x, y]`) remain unchanged. The sorted list `arr` is the only variable that gets updated.
