Output State: **`arr` is now a sorted list with the first element being the integer value of the corresponding string in the original list up to index `x`, followed by `n + arr[0]`; `i` is `x + 1`; `ans` is `x + 1`; `t` is `t - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `n + arr[0]` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially a sorted list of integers, appending `n + arr[0]` keeps the list sorted because `n + arr[0]` is added to the end. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
