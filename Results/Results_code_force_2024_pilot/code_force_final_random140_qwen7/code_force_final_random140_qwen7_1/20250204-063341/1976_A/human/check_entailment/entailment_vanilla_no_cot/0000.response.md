Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions for being strong. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and each password's details.
2. **Validation Logic**:
   - It separates the password into letters and digits.
   - Checks if both letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Ensures that no digit appears after a letter unless the password consists solely of digits.
3. **Output**: For each test case, it prints "YES" if the password is strong and "NO" otherwise.

The function `func_1` processes each password according to the rules and appends the appropriate result to the `results` list. The main part of the script iterates over the test cases and prints the results.

Given the problem statement and the example, the provided solution accurately implements the required functionality.
