### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and each password along with its length `n`.
   - This part is handled well in the loop where it collects the necessary data into `test_cases`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls the function `func_1` with the parsed test cases and stores the results in the `results` list.
   - This is done correctly.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - It initializes two empty strings, `letters` and `digits`, to store the letters and digits from the password.
   - **Separation of Characters**:
     - It iterates through each character in the password and appends it to either `letters` or `digits` based on whether it is a letter or a digit.
   - **Sorting Check**:
     - It checks if the sorted versions of `letters` and `digits` match the original strings. If they don't, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
   - **Order Check**:
     - If both `letters` and `digits` are non-empty, it checks if the last letter appears before the first digit in the password. If this condition is violated, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
   - **Result Append**:
     - If none of the conditions fail, it appends 'YES' to the results list.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case as required.

However, there is a critical flaw in the order check. The condition `if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0]):` is incorrect because it checks if the last letter appears before the first digit, which violates the requirement that no digit should come after a letter. Instead, it should check if any digit comes after a letter.

To fix this, we need to ensure that for every character in the password, if it is a letter, all subsequent characters must also be letters, and if it is a digit, all subsequent characters must also be digits.

Here is the corrected order check:

```python
if letters and digits and any(ch.isdigit() and password.index(ch) < password.index(letters[-1]) for ch in password):
    results.append('NO')
```

With this correction, the function will correctly enforce the rule that no digit can come after a letter.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        digits = ''
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        if letters and digits and any(ch.isdigit() and password.index(ch) < password.index(letters[-1]) for ch in password):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
    return results
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was inaccurate due to the flawed order check in the `func_1` function. The corrected function ensures that no digit comes after a letter, thereby meeting the problem requirements.

### Final:
**False**
