Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password is strong according to the given conditions. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself. This part is correct.

2. **Password Validation**:
   - The program separates the password into letters and digits.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It also ensures that if the password contains both letters and digits, the last letter must come before the first digit in the password.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the password consists only of letters or only of digits correctly.
   - It correctly identifies when the password does not meet the conditions and appends 'NO' to the results list.

4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the validation results.

Given the provided annotated program and the explanation, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` is correct and matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
