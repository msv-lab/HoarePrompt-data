Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly verifies the conditions for a strong password.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the details of each password (length and the password itself). This part is correct.

2. **Password Validation**:
   - The program splits the password into two parts: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It also checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. This is done by comparing the index of the last letter with the index of the first digit in the password.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the password consists only of letters or only of digits, the conditions are trivially satisfied.
   - The program correctly handles these edge cases by checking both `letters` and `digits`.

4. **Logic Flow**:
   - For each password, the program first checks if the letters and digits are sorted.
   - Then, it checks if there is any digit after a letter.
   - If any of these conditions fail, the password is marked as "NO".
   - Otherwise, the password is marked as "YES".

Given the above analysis, the logic implemented in the `func_1` function is correct according to the problem statement. The program correctly identifies whether a password meets the specified criteria.

Correctness: **True**
