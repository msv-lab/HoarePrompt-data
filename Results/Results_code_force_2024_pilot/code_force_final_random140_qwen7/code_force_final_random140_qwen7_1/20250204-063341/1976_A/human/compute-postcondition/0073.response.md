Output State: **`letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the `password` string, `results` is ['NO'], and the last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` string than the first character of `digits`.**

Explanation: The code `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` is `'NO'`, which is a string. After appending, `results` becomes a list containing `'NO'`. All other variables (`letters` and `digits`) remain unchanged, and the condition about the last character of `letters` appearing later in the `password` string than the first character of `digits` also remains valid.
