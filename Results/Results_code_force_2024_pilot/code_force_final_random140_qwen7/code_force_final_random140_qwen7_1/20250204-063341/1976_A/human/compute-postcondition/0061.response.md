Output State: **`letters` is a string that either contains the character `ch` (if `ch` is alphabetic) or is empty (if `ch` is not alphabetic), `digits` is the string `ch` appended to the previous value of `digits`, `results` remains 'NO', and `ch` is the next character in the `password` string.**

This means that the variable `digits` now includes the character `ch` appended to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
