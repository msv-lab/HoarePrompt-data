Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `letters` will be a string containing all alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` will be a string containing all numeric characters from the `password` string, and `results` will remain 'NO'.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has processed every character in the `password` string, `letters` will contain all the alphabetic characters it encountered, `digits` will contain all the numeric characters it encountered, and the variable `results` will still be set to 'NO' as it was initially and has not been changed within the loop.
