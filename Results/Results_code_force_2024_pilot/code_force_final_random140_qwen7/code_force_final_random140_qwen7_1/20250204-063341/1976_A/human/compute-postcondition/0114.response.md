Postcondition: **`results` contains 'NO', `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from the `password`, and `digits` contains all the digits from the `password`. The list `results` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. Additionally, the last letter in `letters` appears at an index in `password` that is less than or equal to the index of the first digit in `digits`.**
