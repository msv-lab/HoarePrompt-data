Output State: **`ch` is a digit, `password` contains at least one character, `digits` is the concatenation of `ch`.**

Explanation: The variable `digits` is assigned the value of `ch`, which is a digit. The initial state of `ch` being a digit and the first character of `password` remains unchanged. The state of `password` containing at least one character also remains unchanged. Therefore, `digits` now holds the value of `ch`.
