Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop iterates over each character `ch` in the string `password`.
2. **Initial Conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `password` must contain at least one character.
3. **Loop Body Analysis**: The loop body checks if the current character `ch` is an alphabetic character or a digit. Depending on the type of the character, it updates either `letters` or `digits`.

Given these points, let's analyze the possible states at the start of the next iteration:

- **Character `ch`**: This is the current character being processed in the loop. Since we are moving to the next character, `ch` will be the next character in the `password` string.
- **Postcondition**: The condition that `password` must contain at least one character remains true because we are processing each character one by one.

Since the loop is iterating through each character of `password`, the only thing that changes is the character `ch` itself. The other variables (`password`, `letters`, `digits`) remain unchanged until the condition inside the loop is met.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `password` still contains at least one character (since we are processing each character one by one).
- `ch` will be the next character in the `password` string.

So, the updated state is:

**State: **`password` must contain at least one character, `ch` is the next character in the `password` string**.
