Output State: **`letters` is a string that either contains the character `ch` (if `ch` is alphabetic) or is empty (if `ch` is not alphabetic), `digits` is a string containing the character `ch` (if `ch` is a digit) or is empty (if `ch` is not a digit), `results` remains 'NO', and `ch` is the next character in the `password` string.**

In this scenario, the code `digits += ch` appends the character `ch` to the string `digits`. This only happens if `ch` is a digit. The initial conditions for `letters` and `results` remain unchanged, and `ch` is still the next character in the `password` string.
