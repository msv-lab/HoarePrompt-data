Output State: **`letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password`, `digits` contains all numeric characters from `password`, `results` contains 'NO'**.

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the variables `letters`, `digits`, and `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions specified.
