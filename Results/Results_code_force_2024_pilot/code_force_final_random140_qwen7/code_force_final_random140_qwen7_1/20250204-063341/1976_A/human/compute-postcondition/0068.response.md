Output State: **`letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the `password` string, `results` is ['NO'], and either `letters` is not sorted or `digits` is not sorted.**

The code `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` was `'NO'`, but now it becomes `['NO']`. All other variables remain unchanged, so `letters` and `digits` retain their initial states, and the condition about either `letters` or `digits` not being sorted still holds true.
