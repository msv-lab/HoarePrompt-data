Output State: **`letters` is '', `digits` is undefined, `results` is ['NO'], `n` is the next value of `n` from `test_cases`, `password` is the corresponding `password` value from `test_cases`**

Explanation: The code assigns an empty string to the variable `letters`. The values of `digits`, `results`, `n`, and `password` remain unchanged from their initial states.
