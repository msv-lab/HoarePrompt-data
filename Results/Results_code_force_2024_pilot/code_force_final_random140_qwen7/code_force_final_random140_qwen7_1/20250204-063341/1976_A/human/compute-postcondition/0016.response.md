Output State: **`password` must contain at least one character; `digits` is the next character in the `password` string.**

Explanation: The code `digits += ch` appends the character `ch` to the variable `digits`. Since `ch` is the next character in the `password` string, `digits` now holds this character. The precondition that `password` must contain at least one character remains unchanged.
