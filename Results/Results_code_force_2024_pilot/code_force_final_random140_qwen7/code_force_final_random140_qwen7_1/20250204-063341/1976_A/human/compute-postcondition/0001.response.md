Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains two variables: `n` and `password`.

2. **Understand the loop initialization**: The loop iterates over `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of two elements: `n` and `password`.

3. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `n` and `password` are taken from each tuple in `test_cases`.
   - Since `test_cases` is a list of strings representing passwords, the first element of each tuple should be a positive integer (as per the problem statement, `t` is a positive integer), and the second element should be a string representing a password.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. If `test_cases` is empty, the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `results` is an empty list and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `t` is a positive integer but is not used in the loop itself; it might be related to the problem context but is not necessary to adjust for the loop to execute.
   - `test_cases` must have at least one tuple to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `test_cases` must have at least one tuple.
- The first tuple in `test_cases` should have `n` as its first element (a positive integer) and `password` as its second element (a string).

State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, the first tuple in `test_cases` must have `n` as a positive integer and `password` as a string**
