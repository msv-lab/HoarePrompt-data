Output State: **`results` contains 'NO', 'NO', `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from the `password`, `digits` contains all the digits from the `password`, and the last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` than the first character of `digits`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contained `'NO'`, so after appending, it now contains `'NO', 'NO'`. The values of `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged, and the condition about the last character of `letters` appearing later in the `password` than the first character of `digits` also remains valid.
