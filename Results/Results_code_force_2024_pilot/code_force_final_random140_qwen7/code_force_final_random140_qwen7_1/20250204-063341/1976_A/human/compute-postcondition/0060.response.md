Output State: **`letters` is a string that now contains the character `ch`, `digits` is a string that is still empty, `results` remains 'NO', and `ch` is the next character in the `password` string.**

Explanation: The line `letters += ch` appends the character `ch` to the string `letters`. Since `ch` is the next character in the `password` string, `letters` now includes this new character. The value of `digits` remains unchanged as it is still an empty string because no digit was added. The `results` variable remains 'NO' as no condition was met to change its value, and `ch` is still the next character in the `password` string.
