You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of strings where each string represents a password consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and each string has a length between 1 and 20 inclusive.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        
        digits = ''
        
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits
            [0]):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
        
    #State: results is a list containing either 'NO', 'NO' or 'NO', 'YES' for each iteration.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' which contains either 'NO', 'NO' or 'NO', 'YES' for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of strings representing passwords. For each password in `test_cases`, the function returns a list named 'results' containing either 'NO', 'NO' or 'NO', 'YES'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named 'results' which contains either 'NO', 'NO' or 'NO', 'YES' for each iteration.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
