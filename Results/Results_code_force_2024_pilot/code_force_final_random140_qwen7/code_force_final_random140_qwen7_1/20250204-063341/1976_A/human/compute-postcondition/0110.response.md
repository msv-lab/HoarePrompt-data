Output State: **`results` contains 'NO', `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from the `password`, and `digits` contains all the digits from the `password`. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no specific loop or iteration context is provided, we assume the context remains the same as before the `continue` statement was executed. Therefore, the values of `results`, `letters`, and `digits` remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.
