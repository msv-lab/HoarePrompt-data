Output State: **`letters` is '', `digits` is '', `results` is ['NO'], `n` is the next value of `n` from `test_cases`, `password` is the corresponding `password` value from `test_cases`**

Explanation: The line `digits = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `digits`. The values of the other variables (`letters`, `results`, `n`, and `password`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
