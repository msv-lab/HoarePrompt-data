Postcondition: **`results` contains 'NO', `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from the `password`, and `digits` contains all the digits from the `password`. The list `results` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition in the if statement is true or false, `results` will always contain 'NO', `letters` will contain all the alphabetic characters from the `password`, and `digits` will contain all the digits from the `password`. The list `results` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
