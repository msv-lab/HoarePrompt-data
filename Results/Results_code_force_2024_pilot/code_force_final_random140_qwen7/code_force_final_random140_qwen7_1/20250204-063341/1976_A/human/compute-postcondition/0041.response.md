Output State: **`letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string, `results` is 'NO', `n` is `n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code snippet sets `digits` to an empty string. This affects the value of `digits`. The other variables (`letters`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Since `letters` is still an empty string and `digits` is now an empty string, the condition for `results` does not change, so `results` remains 'NO'. Additionally, `n` is incremented by 1.
