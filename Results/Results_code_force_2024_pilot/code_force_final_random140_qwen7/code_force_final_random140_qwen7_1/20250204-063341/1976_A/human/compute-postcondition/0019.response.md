Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character. If the next character `ch` in `password` is an alphabet, then `ch` is added to `password`. If the next character `ch` in `password` is a digit, then `ch` is considered as a digit in the password. If `ch` is neither an alphabet nor a digit, no change is made to the password regarding the next character being a digit.
