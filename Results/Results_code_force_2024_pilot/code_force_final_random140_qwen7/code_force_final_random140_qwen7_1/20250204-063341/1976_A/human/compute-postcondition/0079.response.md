Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `password`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each test case defined in `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple `(n, password)`.

3. **Determine the state changes needed**: Since the loop is iterating over each test case, the variables `n` and `password` will change for each iteration. The other variables (`letters`, `digits`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head and therefore their states should not be adjusted here.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: For the next iteration, `n` will be the next value of `n` from the `test_cases` list, and `password` will be the corresponding `password` value.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `password`.

**Step-by-step reasoning**:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the `password` string, and `results` is `['NO']`.
- The loop head variables are `n` and `password`.
- For the next iteration, `n` will be the next value of `n` from the `test_cases` list, and `password` will be the corresponding `password` value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`letters` is undefined, `digits` is undefined, `results` is ['NO'], `n` is the next value of `n` from `test_cases`, `password` is the corresponding `password` value from `test_cases`**
