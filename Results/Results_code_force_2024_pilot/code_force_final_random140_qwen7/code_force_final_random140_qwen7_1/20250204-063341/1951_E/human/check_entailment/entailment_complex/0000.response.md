### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
- It reads each string `s` for each test case.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if the first half of the string `ch` is a palindrome of the second half.
- It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
- This function is used to check if a substring can be split into non-palindromic parts.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function determines how many parts the string `ch` can be split into based on the result of `func_1`.
- It returns:
  - `1` if the string can be split into 1 non-palindromic part.
  - `2` if the string can be split into 2 non-palindromic parts.
  - `3` if the string can be split into 3 non-palindromic parts.
  - `4` if the string cannot be split into non-palindromic parts.

#### Main Logic:
1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the string `s` is a single repeated character (e.g., `"aaaaa"`), it is a palindrome and thus cannot be split into non-palindromic parts.
   - If the string `s` has a specific structure that makes it a palindrome (e.g., `"abccba"`), it also cannot be split into non-palindromic parts.

2. **Splitting Logic**:
   - If `func_1(s)` returns `True`, it means the string `s` is a palindrome or can be split into parts that are not palindromes.
   - Based on the value returned by `func_2(s)`, the string is split into the appropriate number of parts.
   - The program then prints whether a valid partition exists and the details of the partition if it does.

#### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `"sinktheyacht"`
  - `func_1("sinktheyacht")` returns `False` because it is not a palindrome.
  - `func_2("sinktheyacht")` returns `1` because the entire string can be treated as one non-palindromic part.
  - The program correctly outputs `YES` with `1` part: `"sinktheyacht"`.

- **Test Case 2**: `"lllllllll"`
  - `func_1("lllllllll")` returns `True` because it is a palindrome.
  - The program correctly outputs `NO` because no non-palindromic partition is possible.

- **Test Case 3**: `"uwuowouwu"`
  - `func_1("uwuowouwu")` returns `False` because it is not a palindrome.
  - `func_2("uwuowouwu")` returns `3` because the string can be split into 3 non-palindromic parts.
  - The program correctly outputs `YES` with `3` parts: `"uw"`, `"uow"`, `"ouwu"`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the logic specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
