Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome. It works correctly for this purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is supposed to determine how many non-palindromic substrings a given string can be partitioned into. However, it has several issues:
   - It incorrectly handles the partitioning logic.
   - It does not provide a way to actually partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The logic inside `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly determine the number of partitions or provide the partitions themselves.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
- Check if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- If possible, provide such a partition.

Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach to solving the problem:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def can_partition_non_palindromic(s):
    n = len(s)
    # Try to partition the string at every possible position
    for i in range(1, n):
        if not is_palindrome(s[:i]) and not is_palindrome(s[i:]):
            return True, [s[:i], s[i:]]
    return False, []

def solve_test_case(s):
    can_partition, partition = can_partition_non_palindromic(s)
    if can_partition:
        return "YES", len(partition), partition
    else:
        return "NO", 0, []

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        result = solve_test_case(s)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        if result[0] == "YES":
            print("YES")
            print(result[1])
            print(' '.join(result[2]))
        else:
            print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution:
- Defines a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a string is a palindrome.
- Defines a function `can_partition_non_palindromic` to check if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and returns the partition if possible.
- Uses these functions to solve each test case and prints the appropriate output.
