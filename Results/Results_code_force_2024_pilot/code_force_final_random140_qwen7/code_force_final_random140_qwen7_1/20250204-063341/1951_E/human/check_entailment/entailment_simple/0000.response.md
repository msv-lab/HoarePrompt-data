Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires partitioning a string into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes. The solution provided seems to check certain conditions and use helper functions to determine if such a partition is possible.

2. **Key Points to Check**:
   - The logic for determining if a string is a palindrome.
   - The logic for checking if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The handling of edge cases and different lengths of strings.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - **Palindrome Check**: The `func_1` function correctly checks if a string is a palindrome.
   - **Partition Logic**:
     - The `func_2` function attempts to determine how many parts a string can be split into without forming palindromic substrings.
     - The main loop in the program uses the results from `func_2` to attempt to partition the string.
     - The logic for partitioning seems to handle different lengths and conditions appropriately.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Strings of length 1 or 2 are handled correctly.
   - Strings with repeated characters are checked properly.
   - The program handles longer strings by attempting to split them into smaller parts and checking if those parts are palindromic.

5. **Output Handling**:
   - The program prints "YES" or "NO" correctly based on whether a valid partition exists.
   - When a valid partition is found, it prints the number of parts and the parts themselves.

6. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.
   - The logic for checking and partitioning strings seems robust and covers most edge cases.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the required functionality based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
