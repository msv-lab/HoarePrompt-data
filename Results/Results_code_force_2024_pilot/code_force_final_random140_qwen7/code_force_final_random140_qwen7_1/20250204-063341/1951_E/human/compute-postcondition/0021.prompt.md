You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
def func_2(ch):
    b = len(ch) // 2
    if (len(ch) % 2 == 0) :
        if func_1(ch[:b]) :
            a = 3
        else :
            a = 4
        #State: Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is half the length of `ch`, rounded down, and the length of `ch` is even; if the first `b` characters of `ch` satisfy the condition returned by `func_1`, then `a` is 3. Otherwise, `a` is 4.
    else :
        if func_1(ch[:b]) :
            a = 1
        else :
            a = 2
        #State: Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is half the length of `ch`, rounded down, and the length of `ch` is odd; if `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then `a` is 1. Otherwise, `a` is 2.
    #State: Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is half the length of `ch`, rounded down. If the length of `ch` is even, `a` is 3 if the first `b` characters of `ch` satisfy the condition returned by `func_1`; otherwise, `a` is 4. If the length of `ch` is odd, `a` is 1 if `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`; otherwise, `a` is 2.
    return a
    #The program returns either 1, 2, 3, or 4 based on the conditions specified.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `ch`. `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters. Based on certain conditions, the function returns either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `ch` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and return a numeric value (1, 2, 3, or 4) based on specific conditions.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns either 1, 2, 3, or 4 based on the conditions specified.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
