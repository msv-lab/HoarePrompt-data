Output State: **`ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is half the length of `ch`, rounded down, and the length of `ch` is even; the first `b` characters of `ch` satisfy the condition returned by `func_1`; `a` is 3.**

The code `a = 3` assigns the value 3 to the variable `a`. Since `ch`, `b`, and the condition related to `func_1` were part of the initial state and no operations were performed on them, their states remain unchanged.
