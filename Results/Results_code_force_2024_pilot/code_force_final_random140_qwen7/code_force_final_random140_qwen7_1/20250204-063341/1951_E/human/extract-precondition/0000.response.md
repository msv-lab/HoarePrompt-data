Precondition: **ch is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.** 

The function `func_2` takes a string `ch` and performs checks to determine how many parts the string can be divided into such that none of the parts are palindromes. However, the function itself does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem described in the problem statement. It seems to be a helper function that returns a value `a` which is used to decide the number of parts needed for the partition. The actual partitioning logic is missing from the provided code.
