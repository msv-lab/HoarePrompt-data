Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee that the XOR of elements in `l` will be equal to the XOR of elements in `r`. The program attempts to construct `l` and `r` by sorting the first half and the second half of the array, and then tries to fill `l` and `r` with matching elements. However, this approach does not ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` will be equal. For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

The program will sort the first half `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and the second half `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and then try to form `l` and `r` by picking pairs. However, it might pick elements in such a way that the XOR values do not match. For example, if `l` is formed as `[1, 2]` and `r` is formed as `[3, 4]`, the XOR values will be different (`1 ^ 2 = 3` and `3 ^ 4 = 7`). This violates the requirement that the XOR of elements in `l` must be equal to the XOR of elements in `r`.

To fix this, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a hash map to track the XOR values and ensuring that the required pairs are selected correctly.
