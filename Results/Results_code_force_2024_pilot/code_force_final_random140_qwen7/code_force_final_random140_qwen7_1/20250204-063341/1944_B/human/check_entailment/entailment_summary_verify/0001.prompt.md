You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

        print(*ans2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. It sorts the first half of the list and the second half separately. Then, it identifies pairs of identical elements from both halves and constructs two lists, `ans1` and `ans2`, containing up to 2k such pairs. If there are fewer than 2k unique elements, it includes additional elements from the remaining list until 2k elements are included in each list. Finally, it prints the contents of `ans1` and `ans2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is split into two halves: `b` (first `n` elements) and `c` (last `n` elements).

3. **Sorting the Halves:**
   - Both halves `b` and `c` are sorted.

4. **Constructing Arrays `l` and `r`:**
   - The program attempts to construct arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.
   - It tries to use pairs of identical elements from `b` and `c` to form `l` and `r`.
   - If no such pairs are available, it uses elements from the last element of `b` and `c` and any remaining elements from a list `l` which is constructed during the process.

5. **Ensuring Equal XOR Values:**
   - The program constructs `l` and `r` by ensuring that the XOR values match. However, the logic to ensure this is flawed. Specifically, the program does not guarantee that the XOR values will be equal after constructing `l` and `r`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing `l` and `r`:**
   - The program attempts to use pairs of identical elements from `b` and `c` to form `l` and `r`. This approach does not guarantee that the XOR values will be equal.
   - The program constructs `l` and `r` independently without ensuring that their XOR values match.

2. **Incomplete Handling of Remaining Elements:**
   - The program constructs `l` and `r` using elements from `b` and `c` and any remaining elements from `l`. However, it does not ensure that the XOR values will be equal.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` will be equal. The logic to construct `l` and `r` is flawed and does not guarantee the required condition.
