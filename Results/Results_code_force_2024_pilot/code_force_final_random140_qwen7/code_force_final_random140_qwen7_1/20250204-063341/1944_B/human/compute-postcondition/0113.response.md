Output State: **`q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `n + len(a) - 1`, `ans1` contains all elements from index `n` to the end of list `a`, `ans2` contains all elements from index `n` to the end of list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. The values of `q`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new list `a` is created based on the input provided.
