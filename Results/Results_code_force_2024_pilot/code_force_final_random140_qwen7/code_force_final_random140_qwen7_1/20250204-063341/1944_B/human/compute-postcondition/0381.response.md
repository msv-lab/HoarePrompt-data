Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng:`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `sng` has at least one element.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sng` must have at least one element.
   - `sz` is `sz + 1`.
   - If the size of `sng` (which is `sz`) is greater than or equal to two times `k`, we break out of the loop.

4. **Determine the state needed for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still have at least one element.
   - `sz` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - We don't know if the loop will break based on the current value of `sz` and `k`, so we assume it does not break for now.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `sz` is incremented by 1, the new value of `sz` will be `sz + 1`.
   - `sng` must still have at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sng` must have at least one element, and `sz` is `sz + 1`**
