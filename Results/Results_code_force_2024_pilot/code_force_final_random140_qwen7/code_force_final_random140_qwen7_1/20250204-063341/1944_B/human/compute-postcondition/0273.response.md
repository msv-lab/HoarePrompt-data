Postcondition: `k` is an integer, and `b[i]` is processed according to the following rules: if `k == 0`, and `b[i+1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `b[i+1]` is added to `ans1`. If `b[i+1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is not already in `ans1`, then `b[i]` is appended to `ans1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
