Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be less than `len(l)`
- `i` is `n + len(l) - 1`
- `ans1` and `ans2` both contain all elements from index `n` to the end of list `l`
- If `k` equals 0, the loop breaks, but since the loop runs `len(l)` times, this condition does not affect the final state.

The `print(*ans2)` statement will print the elements contained in `ans2`, which is the same as the elements from index `n` to the end of list `l`.

Output: **elements from index n to the end of list l**
