Postcondition: `ans1` now contains the element `l[n]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `len(l)` must be greater than `n`, `ans2` now contains the element `l[n]`, and `k` is 0. If `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the value of `k`.
