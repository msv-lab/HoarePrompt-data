Output State: `k` is 0, `i` is `n`, `ans1` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]]`, `ans2` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]]`.

Explanation: Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, and `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will run exactly `n` times. After `n` iterations, `i` will become equal to `n`, and the loop will terminate because the condition `i < n` will no longer be satisfied. During each iteration, the current element `l[i]` is appended to both `ans1` and `ans2`. Therefore, by the end of the loop, `ans1` and `ans2` will both contain all elements of `l` in the same order.
