Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `elem` and the iterable `rdb`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `rdb` (i.e., `rdb` is non-empty).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is either 0 or 2.
   - `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.

4. **Loop behavior**:
   - For each element `elem` in `rdb`, the loop body is executed.
   - However, the problem does not specify what the loop body does to `sz` or `rdb`. Therefore, we need to consider the general behavior of the loop and how it affects the state.

5. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `rdb` is non-empty, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `rdb`.
   - After processing an element from `rdb`, `rdb` will become a new iterable with one fewer element (assuming the loop body does not modify `rdb` directly).

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `sz` remains unchanged because the problem does not specify any modification to `sz` within the loop body.
   - `rdb` becomes a non-empty iterable with one fewer element.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `sz` is either 0 or 2, and `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element**.
