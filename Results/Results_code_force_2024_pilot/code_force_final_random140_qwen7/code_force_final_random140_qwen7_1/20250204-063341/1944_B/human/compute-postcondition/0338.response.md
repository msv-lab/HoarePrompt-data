Output State: **`ans1` now contains the element `l[i-1]` and the element `l[i]`, `i` is `n + 2`, `len(l)` must be greater than `n`, `ans2` now contains the element `l[n+2]`, and `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is `n + 2`, `ans1` now contains both `l[i-1]` (which was already in `ans1`) and `l[i]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
