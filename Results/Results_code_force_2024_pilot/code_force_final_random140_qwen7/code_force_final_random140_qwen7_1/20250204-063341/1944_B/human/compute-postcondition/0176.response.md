Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to n-1, `n` is a valid integer, and the value of `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `i`, `n`, or `k`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values remain unchanged.
