Output State: `sz` is either 0, 2, or 4, and `rdb` is an empty iterable. The value of `sz` will be 4 if the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` holds true for all elements in `rdb` until the last two elements can be processed. If at any point the condition fails, `sz` will be either 0 or 2, and the loop will break, leaving `rdb` as an iterable with fewer than the required elements to process further.
