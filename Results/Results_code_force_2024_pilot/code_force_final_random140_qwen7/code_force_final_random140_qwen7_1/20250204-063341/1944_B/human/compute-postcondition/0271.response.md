Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), as indicated by `range(1, n)`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is an integer.
   - If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i-1]`, then `b[i]` is added to `ans1`.
   - Otherwise, if `b[i-1]` is not already in `ans1`, then `b[i-1]` is appended to `ans1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `i_end`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`, the next valid value for `i` should be `2` if it's the first iteration after initialization or `i_end + 1` if it's a subsequent iteration.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the start of the next iteration:

- The loop will check the condition for `i = 2` if it's the first iteration after initialization, or `i_end + 1` if it's a subsequent iteration.
- The condition `i < n` must hold true for the loop to continue.

Since the exact value of `i_end` is not provided, we'll assume the general case where `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`k` is an integer, if `b[2]` is equal to `b[1]`, then `b[2]` is added to `ans1`. Otherwise, if `b[1]` is not already in `ans1`, then `b[1]` is appended to `ans1`** (if it's the first iteration after initialization) or **`k` is an integer, if `b[i+1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `b[i+1]` is added to `ans1`. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is not already in `ans1`, then `b[i]` is appended to `ans1`** (for subsequent iterations).

To generalize, the state can be represented as:

**State: **`k` is an integer, if `b[i+1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `b[i+1]` is added to `ans1`. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is not already in `ans1`, then `b[i]` is appended to `ans1`**.
