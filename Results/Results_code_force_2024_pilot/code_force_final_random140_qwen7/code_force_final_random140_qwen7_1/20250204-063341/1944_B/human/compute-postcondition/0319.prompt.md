Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is `req`, all elements of `b` are processed, `ans1` contains elements from `b` based on the specified rules, `ans2` is still an empty list, `l` contains all unique elements from `b` that were not followed by the same element, and `k` is 0; if the last element of `b` (`b[n-1]`) is not in `ans1`, then `l` now includes the last element of `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either -2 or 0 depending on whether `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, and `ans2` is a list containing the value of `c[1]` if `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, and if `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` is a list containing the element `c[2]` appended with `c[2]`. If `c[i]` does not equal `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans2` contains the element `c[3]` appended to it, and `k` is decreased by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
