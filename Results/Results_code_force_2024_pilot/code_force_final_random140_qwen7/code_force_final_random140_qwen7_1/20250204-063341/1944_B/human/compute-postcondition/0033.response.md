Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` remains unchanged, `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]` appended.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `k` was previously set to 0, `i` was incremented by 1, and `l` remained unchanged, these conditions persist. The only new information is that `ans1` now includes the value of `b[i]` appended to it.
