Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All elements in `c` have been iterated over (i.e., `i` equals `n`). `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicate elements found in `c` throughout the entire iteration. `k` is 0 since it is decremented by 2 each time the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` is met, and it starts at 0 or -2, which means it will eventually reach 0 after a sufficient number of iterations. `l` remains unchanged as there is no operation that modifies it within the given loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans1` now contains the element `l[i]`, `i` is `n`, `len(l)` must be greater than `n`, `ans2` now contains the element `l[i]`, and `k` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans2` now contains the element `l[n+1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `len(l)` must be greater than `n`, `ans1` now contains the element `l[i-1]`, and `k` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans1` now contains the element `l[i-1]` and the element `l[i]`, `i` is `n + 2`, `len(l)` must be greater than `n`, `ans2` now contains the elements `l[n+2]` and `l[i]`, and `k` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
