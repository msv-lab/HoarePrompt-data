Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains the value of `c[i]` which is equal to `c[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 1, `c[i]` is `c[1]`, but since `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and `i` is 1, `c[i]` is equal to `c[0]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
