Output State: **`q` is `t`, `k` is 0, `i` is greater than `n + len(a)`, `ans1` is a list containing all elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates are appended twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `l` is a list containing the element `b[n - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[n - 1]` to the list `l`. Since `b` is initially an empty list, `b[n - 1]` does not exist until it is added. After appending, `l` contains the element `b[n - 1]`, which is the last element of `b` before it was added. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
