State: **`sz` is 0, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is iterating over elements in `rdb` using a for loop.
2. For the loop to execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element. If `rdb` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `sz` (which is currently 0) does not directly affect whether the loop can execute. It is not mentioned in the loop head, so its current value does not need to be adjusted.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the nature of `rdb` to ensure it contains at least one element.
