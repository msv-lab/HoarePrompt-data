Output State: **`k` is -4; `i` is incremented by 1; `l` remains unchanged; `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]` appended with `b[i]`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `k` is either -2 or 0.
- The code `k -= 2` subtracts 2 from `k`. If `k` was -2, it becomes -4. If `k` was 0, it becomes -2. However, since the initial state specifies that `k` is either -2 or 0, after executing `k -= 2`, `k` will be -4.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is incremented by 1.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]` appended with `b[i]`, which is unaffected by the code `k -= 2`.
