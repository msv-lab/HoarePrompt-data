Postcondition: `q` is `t`, `k` is -4 if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + len(a) + 1`, `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]` appended to the previous elements, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, and `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
