Output State: The list `sng` must have at least three elements, `sz` is `sz + 3`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `sz` is less than `2 * k`. After each iteration, `sz` is incremented by 1. Since the loop executes 3 times, `sz` is incremented by 1 three times, resulting in `sz` being `sz + 3`. For the loop to execute 3 times, `sng` must contain at least 3 elements. If `sz` reaches or exceeds `2 * k` during any of these iterations, the loop would break early, but based on the given information, it completes 3 full iterations.
