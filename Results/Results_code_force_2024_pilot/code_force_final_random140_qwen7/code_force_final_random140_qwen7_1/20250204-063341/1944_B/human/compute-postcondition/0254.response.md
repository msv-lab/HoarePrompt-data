Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `k` is 0, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `b[i - 1]` is in `ans1`, and `l` contains the value of `b[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 1, `b[i - 1]` is `b[0]`. Since `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1` before the operation, it will now be in `ans1` after appending it to `l`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
