Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `sz` is increased by either 4 or 6 depending on the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2`.**

Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as `2 * k - sz >= 2`, and considering it has executed 3 times, the variable `sz` would have been incremented by either 4 (if the condition was true twice) or 6 (if the condition was true once and then false). After these iterations, since the loop condition will no longer be satisfied (as `2 * k - sz` will be less than 2), the loop terminates. Therefore, `ldb` will be exhausted of its elements by the end of the loop, resulting in an empty `ldb`.
