Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋), and an array `a` which is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. Based on these inputs, the function determines and returns specific outputs for each test case.**

This description adheres to the given constraints and relationships between the input parameters and the nature of the function's operation without detailing the internal process.
