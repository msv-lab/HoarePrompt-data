Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers from the input split by space, `k` is doubled, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the sorted first `k` elements of `a`, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `k`, and `c` is sorted, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `k` is 0. After executing the if-else block, `b[i]` is either equal to `b[i - 1]` and `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]` as a list with one element, or `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, the state remains unchanged. If `b[i - 1]` is in `ans1`, `l` contains the value of `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i-1]`, then `b[i]` is added to `ans1`. Otherwise, if `b[i-1]` is not already in `ans1`, then `b[i-1]` is appended to `ans1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `ans1` is a list that contains elements from `b` according to specific rules (elements are appended if they are not already present or if the next element is the same as the current one), and `b[i-1]` is added to `l` if the if condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
