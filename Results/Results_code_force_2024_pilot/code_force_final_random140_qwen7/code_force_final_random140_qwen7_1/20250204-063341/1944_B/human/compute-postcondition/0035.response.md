Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` remains unchanged, `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]` appended.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by 2, making it `-2`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the exact new value is not specified since the initial value was not given. The value of `l` remains unchanged, and `ans1` still contains the value of `b[i]` appended, which means it has not been altered by the given code snippet.
