Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, and `k` is either -2 or 0, depending on whether `c[3]` equals `c[2]`. After executing the if else block, if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the value of `k` remains unchanged if the condition `k == 0` is false.
