Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `ans2` is a list containing the value of `c[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 1, `c[i]` is `c[1]`. Therefore, `ans2` now contains the value of `c[1]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
