Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `c.sort()` sorts the list `c` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` now contains the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n` and is sorted in ascending order.
