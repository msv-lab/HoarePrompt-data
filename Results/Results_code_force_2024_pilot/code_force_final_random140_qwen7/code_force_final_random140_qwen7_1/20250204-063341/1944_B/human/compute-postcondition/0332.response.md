Output State: **`ans1` now contains the element `l[i]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `len(l)` must be greater than `n`, `ans2` now contains the element `l[n]`, and `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is `n + 1`, the updated state of `ans1` includes the element `l[i]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans2` still contains the element `l[n]`, `k` is still 0, and `i` is updated to `n + 1`.
