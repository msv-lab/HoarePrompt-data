Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. Other variables (`n`, `k`, and `a`) are not yet defined.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
            l.append(b[i - 1])
    if b[n - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `n` must be less than `len(l)`, `i` is `n + len(l) - 1`, `ans1` contains all elements from index `n` to the end of list `l`, `ans2` contains all elements from index `n` to the end of list `l`, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Explanation: Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(l)` and increments `i` by 1 each time, it will run `len(l)` times in total. After all iterations, `i` will be `len(l) - 1` more than the initial value of `n`, which means `i` will be `n + len(l) - 1`. During each iteration, both `ans1` and `ans2` append the current element from `l` at index `i`, so they will contain all elements from index `n` to the end of list `l`. If `k` equals 0, the loop breaks, but since the loop runs `len(l)` times, this condition does not affect the final state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `k` is 0, `i` is `n`, `ans1` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]]`, `ans2` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]]`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` has reached `n` and the condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied. Since `k` was set to 0 at the start and remains unchanged inside the loop, it stays 0. Both `ans1` and `ans2` have been appended with each element of `l` exactly once during the loop iterations, resulting in `ans1` and `ans2` containing all elements of `l` in the same order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans1` contains all elements from `l` except possibly the last one, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicate elements found in `l`, `i` is equal to `len(l)`, `k` is 0, and `l` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
