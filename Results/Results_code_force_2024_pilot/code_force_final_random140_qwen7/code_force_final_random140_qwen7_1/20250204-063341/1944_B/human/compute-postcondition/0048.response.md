Output State: **`k` is either -2 or 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` now contains `b[i-1]` if `b[i-1]` is not already in `ans1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i-1]` to the list `l`. Since `i` was incremented by 1 before this line, `b[i-1]` refers to the element at the position that was `i-1` before the increment. The value of `k` and whether `l` contains `b[i-1]` depends on whether `b[i-1]` is in `ans1`. If `b[i-1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` will contain `b[i-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.
