Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split by space, `k` is an integer from the input split by space, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `b = a[:n]` creates a new list `b` that contains the first `n` elements of the list `a`. The values of `a` and `k` remain unchanged.
