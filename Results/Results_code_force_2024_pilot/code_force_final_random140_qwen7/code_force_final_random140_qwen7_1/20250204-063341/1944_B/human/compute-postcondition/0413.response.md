Output State: **`sz` is 2 or 4, and `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than before**.

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `sz` is either 0 or 2. After executing `sz += 2`, if `sz` was initially 0, it becomes 2; if `sz` was initially 2, it becomes 4. The value of `rdb` remains unchanged except for its length, which is specified to be one less than before.
