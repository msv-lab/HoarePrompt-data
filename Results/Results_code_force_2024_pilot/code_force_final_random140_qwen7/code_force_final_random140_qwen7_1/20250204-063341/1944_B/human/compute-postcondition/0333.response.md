Output State: **`ans2` now contains the element `l[n+1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `len(l)` must be greater than `n`, `ans1` now contains the element `l[i-1]`, and `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends `l[i]` to `ans2`. Given that `i` is `n + 1`, `ans2.append(l[i])` appends `l[n+1]` to `ans2`. The values of `i`, `len(l)`, `ans1`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
