Output State: **`sz` is either 3, 5, or 7; `rdb` is an empty iterable; `sng` is not empty and has one fewer element than it did at the start of the loop.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. Given that `sz` was initially either 2, 4, or 6, adding 1 to each of these values results in `sz` being either 3, 5, or 7. The values of `rdb` and `sng` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
