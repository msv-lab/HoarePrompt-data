Based on the initial state, `ldb` contains at least one element, and `sz` is increased by 2. However, there is no explicit value or further definition for `elem` in the given information. Since `elem` is not defined in the context provided, it is reasonable to assume that `elem` refers to the first element of `ldb`.

Given this, the print statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` will print the first element of `ldb` twice, with a space as the separator due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the first element of the list ldb)**
