Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is 0, and if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `k` becomes -2 and `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]`. If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, then `k` remains 0, and if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` will contain `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i - 1]` is already in `ans1`, no changes occur to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is either -2 or 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` remains unchanged unless `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, in which case `l` now contains `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `k` becomes -2 and `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]`. If `b[i + 1]` equals `b[i]` and `b[i]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains `b[i + 1]`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `l` and `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is either -2 or 0, `i` is incremented by 1. `l` remains unchanged unless `b[i-1]` is not in `ans1`, in which case `l` now contains `b[i-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
