Output State: **`ldb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is increased by 2, and the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is no longer satisfied.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 2` increases the value of `sz` by 2. Since `sz` was initially such that the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` was satisfied, increasing `sz` by 2 would make this condition no longer true. Therefore, the updated state is that `sz` is increased by 2, and the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is no longer satisfied. The precondition that `ldb` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
