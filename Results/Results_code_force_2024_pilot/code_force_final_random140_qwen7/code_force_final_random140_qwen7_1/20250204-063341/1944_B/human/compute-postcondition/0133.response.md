Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n + len(a) - 1`, `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`.**

The value of `k` is decremented by 2, making it -2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
