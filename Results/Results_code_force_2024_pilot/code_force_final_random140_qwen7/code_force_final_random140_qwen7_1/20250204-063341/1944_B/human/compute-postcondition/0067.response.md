Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, the current value of `k` is 0, and the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `c[i - 1]`; `ans2` is a list containing the value of `c[i]` and the append operation has been performed.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, and since `i` is 1, `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`. Therefore, `ans2` now contains the value of `c[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
