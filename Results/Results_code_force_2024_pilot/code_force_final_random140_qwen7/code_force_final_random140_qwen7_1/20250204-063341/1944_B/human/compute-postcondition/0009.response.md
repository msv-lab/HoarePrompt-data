Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = []` initializes an empty list named `ans2`. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about `ans2` being an empty list, while keeping all other variables and their states unchanged.
