Based on the initial state and the given code snippet, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `sz` is either 0 or 2.
   - `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in `rdb`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement prints two values of `elem` separated by a space.
   - `elem` is the current element being processed from the iterable `rdb`.

4. **Determination of `elem`**:
   - Since `rdb` is a non-empty iterable and the loop continues as long as there are elements in `rdb`, `elem` will be the current element being processed.
   - The specific value of `elem` is not provided in the initial state, but it is the current element from `rdb`.

5. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space.

Given the above analysis, the output will be the value of `elem` printed twice.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the current element from the iterable rdb)**
