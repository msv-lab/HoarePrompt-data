Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to n-1, `n` is a valid integer, `k` equals -2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]`; `ans2` now contains the value of `c[i]` and is a list containing one element which is `c[i]`.**

The value of `k` is decremented by 2, making it `-2`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
