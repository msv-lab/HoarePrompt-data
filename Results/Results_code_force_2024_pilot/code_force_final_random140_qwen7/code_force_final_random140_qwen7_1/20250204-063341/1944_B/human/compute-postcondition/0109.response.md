Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be less than `len(l)`
- `i` is set to `n + len(l) - 1`
- `ans1` and `ans2` both contain all elements from index `n` to the end of list `l`
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(l)`, incrementing `i` by 1 each time, and appends each element from `l` at index `i` to `ans1` and `ans2`
- The loop will run `len(l)` times, so `i` will eventually be `len(l) - 1` more than the initial value of `n`, making `i` equal to `n + len(l) - 1`
- The condition `if k == 0` does not affect the final state because the loop runs `len(l)` times regardless

Therefore, `ans1` will contain all elements from index `n` to the end of list `l`.

Output: **[element from index n to the end of list l]**
