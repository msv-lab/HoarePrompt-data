Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or -2 depending on whether `c[2]` equals `c[1]`, and `ans2` now contains the element `c[2]` appended to it, and `ans2` has been updated by appending `c[i]` which is `c[2]`.**

In natural language: `i` remains 2, `n` must still be greater than 1, `k` is still either 0 or -2 depending on whether `c[2]` equals `c[1]`, and `ans2` now contains the element `c[2]` appended to it, and since `i` is 2, `ans2` has been further updated by appending `c[2]` to itself.
