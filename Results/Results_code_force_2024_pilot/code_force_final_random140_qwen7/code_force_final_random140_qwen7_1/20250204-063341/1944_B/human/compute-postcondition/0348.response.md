Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the postcondition will be as follows:

- The variable `i` will be equal to `n`.
- The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to `n-1` (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`).
- The list `rdb` will contain all elements from `rgt` that are consecutive duplicates. Specifically, if `rgt[j] == rgt[j-1]` for any `j` in the range from 2 to `n-1`, then `rgt[j]` will be in `rdb`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `rdb` will hold all the consecutive duplicate elements found in `rgt`, starting from the second element, and `i` will be equal to `n`.
