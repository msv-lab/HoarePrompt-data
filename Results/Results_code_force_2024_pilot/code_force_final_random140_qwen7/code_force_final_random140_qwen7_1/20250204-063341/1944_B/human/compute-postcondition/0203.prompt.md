Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is `t`, `k` is 0, `i` is greater than `n + len(a)`, `ans1` is a list containing all elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates are appended twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, and `l` is a list containing the element `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`; `k` is now equal to `req`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is within the range 1 to n-1, `n` is a valid integer, and if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` equals -2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans2` contains the value of `c[i]` as a list with one element. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` remains unchanged and the program continues execution without breaking out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is within the range 2 to n-1, `n` is a valid integer, `ans2` now contains the elements from `c[2]` to `c[i-1]` appended with `c[i]` if `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `c[i]` does not equal `c[i-1]`, `ans2` remains unchanged and `k` is decreased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is within the range 3 to n-1, `ans2` now contains the elements from `c[2]` to `c[i-1]` appended with either `c[i]` or `c[i]` and `c[i-1]`, depending on whether `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
