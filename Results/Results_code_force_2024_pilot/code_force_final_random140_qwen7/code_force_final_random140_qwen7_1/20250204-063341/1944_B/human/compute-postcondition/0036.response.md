Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` now contains `b[i - 1]`, and if `b[i + 1]` equals `b[i]`, then `k` becomes -2 and `ans1` contains the value of `b[i + 1]`. If `b[i + 1]` does not equal `b[i]` and `b[i]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[i - 1])` appends the value of `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`. This operation modifies the value of `l` but does not affect the values of `k` or `i` directly. The condition checking for equality between `b[i + 1]` and `b[i]` and the assignment to `k` and `ans1` remain as they were, only now `l` has been updated with the value of `b[i - 1]`.
