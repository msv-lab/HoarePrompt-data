Output State: **`sz` is 2, and `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than before**.

Explanation: The code `sz += 2` increments the value of `sz` by 2. Given the initial conditions, `sz` was either 0 or 2. After adding 2, `sz` will now be 2. Additionally, since the loop continues based on the elements in `rdb`, after processing one element, `rdb` will have one less element than before. Therefore, the updated state is `sz` is 2, and `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than before.
