Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, `ans2` now contains the elements `c[3]` and `c[3]`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2. Initially, `k` is either -2 or 0. Since `k -= 2`, if `k` was -2, it remains -2, and if `k` was 0, it becomes -2. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged.
