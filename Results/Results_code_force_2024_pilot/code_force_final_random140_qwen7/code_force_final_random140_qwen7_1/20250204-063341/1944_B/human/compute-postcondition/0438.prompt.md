Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `sz` is either 0, 2, or 4, and `rdb` is an empty iterable. The value of `sz` will be 4 if the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` holds true for all elements in `rdb` until the last two elements can be processed. If at any point the condition fails, `sz` will be either 0 or 2, and the loop will break, leaving `rdb` as an iterable with fewer than the required elements to process further.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= 2 * k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sz` is either 1, 3, or 5; `rdb` is an empty iterable; and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is either 2, 4, or 6; `rdb` is an empty iterable; `sng` is not empty; and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is either 3, 5, or 7; `rdb` is an empty iterable; `sng` is not empty and has one fewer element than it did at the start of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
