Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans2` has the element `c[3]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The line `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `c` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans2` now includes the element `c[3]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
