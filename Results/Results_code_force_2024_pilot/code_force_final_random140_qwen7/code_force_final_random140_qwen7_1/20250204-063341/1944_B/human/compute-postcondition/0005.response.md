Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code `c = a[n:]` assigns to `c` a slice of the list `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` now contains the elements of `a` from index `n` onwards.
