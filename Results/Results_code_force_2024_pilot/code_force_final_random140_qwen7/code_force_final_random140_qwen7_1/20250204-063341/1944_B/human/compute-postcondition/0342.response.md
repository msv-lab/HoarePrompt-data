Given the initial state:
- `ans1` contains all elements from `l` except possibly the last one.
- `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicate elements found in `l`.
- `i` is equal to `len(l)`.
- `k` is 0.
- `l` remains unchanged.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(*ans1)` executes.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `ans1` is derived from `l` by removing the last element if it exists. This means `ans1` contains all elements of `l` except potentially the last one.
2. The `*` operator in `print(*ans1)` unpacks `ans1` into separate arguments for the `print` function, so it will print each element of `ans1` on the same line separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be all elements of `l` except possibly the last one, printed on a single line.

Output: **all elements of l except possibly the last one**
