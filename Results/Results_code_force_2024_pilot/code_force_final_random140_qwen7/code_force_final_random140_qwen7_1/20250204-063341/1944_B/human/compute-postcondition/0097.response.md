Output State: **`n` must be less than `len(l)`, `i` is `n + 1`, `ans1` and `ans2` both contain the element at index `n` of list `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement where `k` was being checked against 0. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and the condition involving `k` remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.
