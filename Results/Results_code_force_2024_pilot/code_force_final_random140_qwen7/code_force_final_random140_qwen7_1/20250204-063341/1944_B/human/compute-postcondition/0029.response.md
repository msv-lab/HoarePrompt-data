Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `k` is 0.
   - If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `k` becomes -2 and `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]`.
   - If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, then `k` remains 0, and if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` will contain `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i - 1]` is already in `ans1`, no changes occur to `l`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`.
   - This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 each time the loop iterates.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Considering the Conditions:**
   - The conditions inside the loop depend on the values of `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]`.
   - Since `i` is incremented, the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]` will now check `b[i + 1] == b[i]`.

5. **Updating States:**
   - `k` will remain 0 unless `b[i + 1]` equals `b[i]`, in which case `k` will become -2 and `ans1` will contain the value of `b[i + 1]`.
   - `l` will be updated if `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]` (which is now `b[i + 1]`), and `b[i - 1]` (which is now `b[i]`) is not in `ans1`.

Given these points, let's update the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `k` will remain 0 unless `b[i + 1]` equals `b[i]`, in which case `k` will become -2 and `ans1` will contain the value of `b[i + 1]`.
- `l` will be updated if `b[i + 1]` does not equal `b[i]` and `b[i]` is not in `ans1`.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, if `b[i + 1]` equals `b[i]`, then `k` becomes -2 and `ans1` contains the value of `b[i + 1]`. If `b[i + 1]` does not equal `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is not in `ans1`, `l` will contain `b[i]`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `l`.**
