Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Postconditions**:
   - `k` is either -2 or 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `l` remains unchanged unless `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, in which case `l` now contains `b[i - 1]`.
   - If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `k` becomes -2 and `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]`.
   - If `b[i + 1]` equals `b[i]` and `b[i]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains `b[i + 1]`.
   - Otherwise, no changes occur to `l` and `k`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `k` is either -2 or 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `l` remains unchanged unless `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, in which case `l` now contains `b[i - 1]`.
   - If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `k` becomes -2 and `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]`.
   - If `b[i + 1]` equals `b[i]` and `b[i]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains `b[i + 1]`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a loop boundary.
   - `k` can still be either -2 or 0 (it does not change based on the loop itself).
   - `l` will remain unchanged unless `b[i]` is not in `ans1`, in which case `l` will contain `b[i]`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` can still be -2 or 0.
- `l` will remain unchanged unless `b[i]` is not in `ans1`, in which case `l` will contain `b[i]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`k` is either -2 or 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` remains unchanged unless `b[i]` is not in `ans1`, in which case `l` now contains `b[i]`**, `n` remains the same.**
