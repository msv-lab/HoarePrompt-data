Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans2` is a list containing the element `c[2]` appended with `c[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, the value `c[2]` is appended to `ans2`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
