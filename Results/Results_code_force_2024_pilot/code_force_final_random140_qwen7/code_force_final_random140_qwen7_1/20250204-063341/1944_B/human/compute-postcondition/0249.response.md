Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, and `ans1` now contains the value of `b[i]` and is a list with one element.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to -2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
