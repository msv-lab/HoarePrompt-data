Output State: **`q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `n + len(a) - 1`, `ans1` contains all elements from index `n` to the end of list `a`, `ans2` contains all elements from index `n` to the end of list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `b = a[:n]` creates a new list `b` that contains the first `n` elements of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
