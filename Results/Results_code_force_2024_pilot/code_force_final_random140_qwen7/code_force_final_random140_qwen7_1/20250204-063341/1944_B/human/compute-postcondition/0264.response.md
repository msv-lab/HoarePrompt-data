Output State: **`k` is an integer; `ans1` is a list containing the current elements of `ans1` plus `b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since the initial state mentions that `ans1` has already appended `b[i]` to its current list, the updated state of `ans1` includes all its previous elements plus the new element `b[i]`. The value of `k` remains unchanged.
