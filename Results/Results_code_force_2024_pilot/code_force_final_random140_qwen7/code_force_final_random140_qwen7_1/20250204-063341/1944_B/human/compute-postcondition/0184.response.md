Postcondition: `i` is within the range 1 to n-1, `n` is a valid integer, and if `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, then `k` equals -2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans2` contains the value of `c[i]` as a list with one element. If `c[i]` does not equal `c[i - 1]`, then `k` remains unchanged, and `ans2` remains unmodified.
