Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, and `k` is either -2 or 0, depending on whether `c[3]` equals `c[2]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `k`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
