Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 3, `ans1` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1]]`, `ans2` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], l[2]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the given code snippet, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
