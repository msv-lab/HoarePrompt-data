Output State: **`k` is an integer, if `b[i+1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `b[i+1]` is added to `ans1`. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is not already in `ans1`, then `b[i]` is appended to `ans1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the loop or conditional statement being executed is broken out of, but the conditions for adding elements to `ans1` based on the values of `b[i]` and `b[i+1]` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed. The values of `k`, `b`, and `ans1` are unchanged except that the loop or conditional block is exited.
