Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split by space, `k` is an integer from the input split by space, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the sorted first `k` elements of `a`, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `k`, and `c` is sorted, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = []` initializes `ans2` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `a`, `k`, `b`, `c`, or `ans1`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
