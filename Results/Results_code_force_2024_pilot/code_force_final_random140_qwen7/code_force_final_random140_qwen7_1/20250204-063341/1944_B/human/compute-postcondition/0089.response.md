Output State: **All elements in `c` have been processed, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 0 or less than 0, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `c`, and `l` remains unchanged as per the initial state or is set based on the final condition of `b[n-1]` not being in `ans1` if applicable.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 up to `n-1`. The loop continues as long as `k` is not zero. Each time `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, two of the same elements are appended to `ans2` and `k` is decremented by 2. If `k` reaches zero before all elements in `c` are processed, the loop breaks. Therefore, `k` will be 0 or less than 0 upon completion. The variable `l` remains unchanged unless the last element of `b` is not in `ans1`, in which case `l` would contain the last element of `b`.
