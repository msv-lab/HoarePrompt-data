Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, and `ans2` now contains the element `c[2]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 2, so if `k` was initially 0 or -2, it will become -2 or -4 respectively. However, since the initial value of `k` is specified as either 0 or -2, after decrementing by 2, `k` will be -2. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged.
