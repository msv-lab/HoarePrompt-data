Output State: **`i` is within the range 3 to n-1, `ans2` now contains the elements from `c[2]` to `c[i-1]` appended with `c[i]` and `c[i]`, `k` is decreased by 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` was already within the range 3 to n-1, and `ans2` contained the elements from `c[2]` to `c[i-1]` appended with `c[i]`, appending `c[i]` again means `ans2` now includes `c[i]` twice. The value of `k` is decreased by 2, but since the exact new value of `k` is not specified, we only note that it has been decreased by 2.
