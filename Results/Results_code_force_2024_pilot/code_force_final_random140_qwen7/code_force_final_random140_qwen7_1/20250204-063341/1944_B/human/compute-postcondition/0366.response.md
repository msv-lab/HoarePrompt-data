The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `ldb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `ldb`. The postcondition given does not directly involve the loop variables `elem` or `ldb` but rather describes what happens inside the loop body.

However, since we need to adjust the state based on the loop head, we focus on `ldb`. The loop will continue as long as `ldb` contains at least one element. At the end of the previous iteration, `ldb` contains at least one element, and `sz` is increased by 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ldb` must still contain at least one element. Since the loop body does not remove elements from `ldb`, `ldb` will still contain at least one element unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not indicated here.

Therefore, the state remains the same regarding `ldb` containing at least one element, and `sz` will be increased by another 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, and `sz` is increased by 2**
