Output State: **`q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `n + len(a) - 1`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` contains all elements from index `n` to the end of list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of list `a`, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `c` is sorted.**

Explanation: The line `ans1 = []` initializes `ans1` as an empty list. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
