Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicates from the second element of `rgt`, and `sz` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is increased by 2 if the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is initially satisfied, and the loop or if statement is exited if the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` holds.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one element, and `sz` is increased by 2. This increase happens regardless of whether the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is satisfied, as `sz` is incremented in both the if and else parts of the block.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one element, and `sz` is increased by either 2 or 4 depending on whether the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is met. If the condition is true, `sz` is increased by 4. If the condition is false, `sz` is increased by 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
