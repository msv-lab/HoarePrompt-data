Output State: **`k` is either -2 or 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` remains unchanged, `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `b`, `ans1`, or `i`, the only changes are that `i` is incremented by 1 (if it was not already incremented), and `b[i]` is added to `ans1`. The value of `l` remains unchanged because the condition for changing `l` (`b[i]` is not in `ans1`) is not met initially. The value of `k` remains either -2 or 0 as specified in the initial state.
