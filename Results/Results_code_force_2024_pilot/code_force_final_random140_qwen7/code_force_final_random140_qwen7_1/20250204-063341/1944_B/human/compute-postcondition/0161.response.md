Output State: **`q` is `t`, `k` is -6, `i` is `n + len(a) + 1`, `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]` appended to the previous elements, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, and `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, and `ans1` is updated by appending `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, so `k` becomes -6. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
