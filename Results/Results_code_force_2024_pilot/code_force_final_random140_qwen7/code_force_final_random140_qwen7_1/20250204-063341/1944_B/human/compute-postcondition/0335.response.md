Output State: **`ans2` now contains the element `l[n+2]`, `i` is `n + 2`, `len(l)` must be greater than `n`, `ans1` now contains the element `l[i-1]`, and `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. All the initial conditions remain the same.
