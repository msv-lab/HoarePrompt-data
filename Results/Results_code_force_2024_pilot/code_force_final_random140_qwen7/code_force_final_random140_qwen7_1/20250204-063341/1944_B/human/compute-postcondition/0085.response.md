Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either -2 or 0, depending on whether `c[3]` equals `c[2]`, and `ans2` now contains the elements `c[3]` and `c[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `c[i]` is `c[3]`. Since `ans2` initially contains the element `c[3]`, after appending `c[3]` again, `ans2` now contains the element `c[3]` twice. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
