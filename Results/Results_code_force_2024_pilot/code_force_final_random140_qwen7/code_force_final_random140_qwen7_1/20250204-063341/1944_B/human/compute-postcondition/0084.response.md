Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either -2 or 0, depending on whether `c[3]` equals `c[2]`, and `ans2` now contains the element `c[3]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `c[i]` to `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `c[i]` is `c[3]`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
