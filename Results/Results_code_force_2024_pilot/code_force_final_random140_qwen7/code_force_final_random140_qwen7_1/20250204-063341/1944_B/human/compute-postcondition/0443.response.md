Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( T \), and for each test case, two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and an array \( a \) consisting of \( 2n \) integers where each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly twice. It then sorts the first half and second half of the array separately, identifies duplicate and singular elements in each half, and prints pairs of elements from these halves such that the total count of printed elements equals \( 2k \). If there are not enough elements to print exactly \( 2k \) pairs, it prints as many as possible. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variables `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are empty, and the total number of printed elements across all test cases is \( 2T \).**
