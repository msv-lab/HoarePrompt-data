Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split by space, `k` is an integer from the input split by space, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the sorted first `k` elements of `a`, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `k`, and `c` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `c.sort()` sorts the sublist `c`, which contains the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `k`. The sorting operation modifies `c` in place, so `c` is now sorted while `a`, `k`, and `b` remain unchanged.
