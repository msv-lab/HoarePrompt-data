Output State: **`sz` is either 6, 8, or 10; `rdb` is an empty iterable; `sng` is empty.**

Explanation: Given the conditions and the behavior of the loop, after the loop executes all its iterations, `sz` would have incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs up to 3 times based on the provided states, `sz` would reach either 6, 8, or 10 (depending on whether `sz` started as 4, 2, or 0 respectively). The loop breaks when `sz` reaches or exceeds `2 * k`, which means `sng` would be exhausted, making it empty by the end of the loop. The variable `rdb` remains an empty iterable as it is not affected by the loop.
