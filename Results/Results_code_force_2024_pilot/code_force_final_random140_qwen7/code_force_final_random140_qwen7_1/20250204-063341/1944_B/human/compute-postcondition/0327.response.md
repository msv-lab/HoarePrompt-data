Output State: **`ans1` now contains the element `l[i]`, `i` is `n`, `len(l)` must be greater than `n`, `ans2` now contains the element `l[i]`, and `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `ans2` now includes the element `l[n]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
