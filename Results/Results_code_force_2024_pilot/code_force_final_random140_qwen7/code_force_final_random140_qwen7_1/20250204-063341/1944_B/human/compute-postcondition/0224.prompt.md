Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will continue to execute until `k` becomes 0. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `ans2` will contain all elements from `c[1]` to `c[i-1]` (where `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop), each element in `c` that is the same as its previous element will be appended twice in `ans2`. `k` will be 0, and no further changes will occur to any of the variables outside the loop since the loop condition `i < n` will no longer be satisfied when `i` reaches `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `ans1` is a list with the element `l[i]` appended to it; `ans2` is a list with the element `l[i]` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is 0, `i` is 2, `ans1` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1]]`, `ans2` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], l[2]]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is 0, `i` is 3, `ans1` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], l[3]]`, `ans2` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], l[3]]`, and we append `l[3]` to `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
