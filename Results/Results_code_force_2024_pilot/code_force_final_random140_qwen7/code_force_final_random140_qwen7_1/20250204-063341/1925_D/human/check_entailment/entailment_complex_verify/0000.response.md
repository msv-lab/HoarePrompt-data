### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions. The key points are:
1. Each pair of friends has a friendship value that increases by 1 for each excursion they are chosen.
2. The probability of choosing a specific pair changes as their friendship value increases.
3. The expected value needs to be calculated considering these changing probabilities.

#### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to compute the expected value using a simplified formula:
\[ \text{num} = p \times k \times k - p \times k + 2 \times k \times C \times S \]
\[ \text{den} = 2 \times C \times C \]

Where:
- \( p \) is the number of pairs of friends.
- \( k \) is the number of excursions.
- \( C = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \) is the total number of possible pairs.
- \( S \) is the sum of the initial friendship values of the pairs.
- \( \text{num} \) and \( \text{den} \) are used to form a fraction, which is then simplified and inverted to get the expected value.

However, the program does not correctly account for the changing probabilities of choosing each pair as their friendship value increases. This is a critical oversight because the probability of choosing a pair decreases as their friendship value increases, and the expected value should reflect these changes.

To illustrate, consider the provided example:
```
3
4 2 3
1 2 10
2 3 20
```

- There are 4 children, 2 pairs of friends, and 3 excursions.
- The pairs of friends are (1, 2) with a friendship value of 10 and (2, 3) with a friendship value of 20.
- The total number of possible pairs \( C = \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 6 \).

The program calculates:
\[ S = 10 + 20 = 30 \]
\[ C = 6 \]
\[ \text{num} = 2 \times 3 \times 3 - 2 \times 3 + 2 \times 3 \times 6 \times 30 = 54 \]
\[ \text{den} = 2 \times 6 \times 6 = 72 \]
\[ g = \text{gcd}(54, 72) = 18 \]
\[ \text{num} = 54 / 18 = 3 \]
\[ \text{den} = 72 / 18 = 4 \]
\[ \text{den} = 4^{-1} \mod 1000000007 = 750000007 \]
\[ \text{ans} = 3 \times 750000007 \mod 1000000007 = 2250000021 \mod 1000000007 = 2250000021 \]

This result is clearly incorrect because the expected value should be calculated considering the changing probabilities.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions. The program fails to account for the changing probabilities as the friendship values increase.

### Final:
Final: **False**
