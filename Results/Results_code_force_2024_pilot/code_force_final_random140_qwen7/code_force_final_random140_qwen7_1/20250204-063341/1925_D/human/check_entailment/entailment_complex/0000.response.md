Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for \(k\) excursions, where each excursion randomly selects a pair of friends, increasing their friendship value by 1 each time they are selected.

2. **Key Formulas**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values can be derived using linearity of expectation.
   - For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value per excursion is \(\frac{k}{C}\), where \(C\) is the total number of unique pairs of children.
   - The total expected value is the sum of these expected increases for all pairs of friends.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly initializes the necessary variables and reads the input.
   - It calculates \(C\) as the total number of unique pairs of children.
   - It computes \(S\) as the sum of the friendship values for all given pairs of friends.
   - The formula used to compute the numerator (`num`) and denominator (`den`) is correct based on the problem statement.
   - The GCD is used to simplify the fraction.
   - The modular multiplicative inverse is correctly computed and used to find the final result.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as ensuring the sum of \(n\) and \(m\) does not exceed \(10^5\) and the sum of \(k\) does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

5. **Output**:
   - The output is computed correctly as \( \text{num} \times \text{den}^{-1} \mod 1000000007 \), which matches the required format.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
