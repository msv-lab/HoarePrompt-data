Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program calculates the sum `S` of all friendship values `f_i` from the input.
   - This is done using the line `S += int(input().split()[2])` inside the loop for `p` (which should be `m`).

3. **Total Possible Pairs:**
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs `C` using the formula `C = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program uses the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values:
     \[
     \text{num} = p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S
     \]
     \[
     \text{den} = 2 \cdot C \cdot C
     \]
   - Here, `p` should be `m`, the number of pairs of friends.

5. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den` using `math.gcd(num, den)`.

6. **Simplification:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction by dividing both `num` and `den` by their GCD.

7. **Modular Inverse:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `den` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `pow(den, -1, MOD)`.

8. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the final answer using the formula:
     \[
     \text{ans} = (\text{num} \times \text{den}^{-1}) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]

### Verification:

- The logic for calculating the expected value seems correct based on the problem statement.
- The use of modular arithmetic and the calculation of the modular inverse is appropriate.
- However, there is a potential issue with the formula used for the numerator. The formula provided in the explanation might not be accurate for the expected value calculation as described in the problem.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the steps correctly but there is a discrepancy in the formula used for the numerator. The correct formula for the expected value should consider the probability of choosing each pair and the effect of the friendship value increasing over time.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the program does not seem to correctly implement the expected value calculation as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
