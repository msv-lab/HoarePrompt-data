### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program follows the steps outlined in the problem description. However, it incorrectly concludes that the formula used for the numerator is incorrect without providing a detailed explanation. Let's break down the problem and the program step-by-step to verify the correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- Each pair of friends has their friendship value increased by 1 for each subsequent excursion they are chosen.
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values can be derived using combinatorial probability and expectation.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It then reads \( m \) lines, each containing \( a_i \), \( b_i \), and \( f_i \).

2. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums up the friendship values \( f_i \) from the input.
   - This is done using the line `S += int(input().split()[2])` inside the loop for \( m \).

3. **Total Possible Pairs:**
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of possible pairs \( C \) using the formula \( C = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program uses the following formulas for the numerator and denominator:
     \[
     \text{num} = p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S
     \]
     \[
     \text{den} = 2 \cdot C \cdot C
     \]
   - Here, \( p \) is the number of pairs of friends, which is \( m \).

5. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den` using `math.gcd(num, den)`.

6. **Simplification:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction by dividing both `num` and `den` by their GCD.

7. **Modular Inverse:**
   - The program correctly calculates the modular inverse of `den` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) using `pow(den, -1, MOD)`.

8. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the final answer using the formula:
     \[
     \text{ans} = (\text{num} \times \text{den}^{-1}) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]

#### Correctness Verification:
- The formulas used in the program are derived from the problem statement and are correct.
- The modular arithmetic and the calculation of the modular inverse are appropriate.
- The program handles the problem constraints and input sizes correctly.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was overly critical and did not fully justify the correctness of the program. The program correctly implements the expected value calculation as per the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
