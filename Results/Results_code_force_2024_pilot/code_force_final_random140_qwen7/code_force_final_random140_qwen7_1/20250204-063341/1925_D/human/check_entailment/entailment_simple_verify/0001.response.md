### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program follows the steps described in the problem statement, but it incorrectly states that the formula used for the numerator is accurate. Let's re-evaluate the problem and the program step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Restatement:
We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions. If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. The friendship value of non-friend pairs remains 0.

#### Key Points:
1. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The sum \( S \) of the friendship values \( f_i \) for all pairs of friends.
2. **Probability of Choosing a Pair**: Each pair is chosen with equal probability.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values for \( k \) excursions.

#### Correct Formula:
The expected value \( E \) for each excursion can be derived as follows:
- For each pair of friends, the probability of being chosen in any single excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
- The expected increase in friendship value for a pair of friends in one excursion is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
- Since the friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if chosen, the expected value for each pair of friends over \( k \) excursions is \( k \times \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

Thus, the expected value for the sum of all pairs is:
\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( k \times \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) f_i = \frac{k^2}{\binom{n}{2}} \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \]

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: Correctly reads the number of test cases, \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and the friendship values.
2. **Sum of Friendship Values**: Correctly sums the friendship values \( S \).
3. **Total Possible Pairs**: Correctly calculates \( C = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The numerator should be \( p \cdot k^2 - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \).
   - The denominator should be \( 2 \cdot C^2 \).
   - Simplifying and taking the modular inverse is correct.

However, the original assessment incorrectly states the formula for the numerator. The correct formula is:
\[ \text{num} = p \cdot k^2 - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \]

Given the correct formula, the program should be correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the expected value calculation based on the correct formula. The original assessment was inaccurate due to the incorrect formula mentioned.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
