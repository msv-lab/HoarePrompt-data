Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions. Each excursion involves choosing a pair of children randomly, and if the pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Friendship Value Increase**: Each time a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
   - **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The program initializes `MOD` to `10^9 + 7` and reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then processes `m` pairs of friends with their respective friendship values.
   - **Sum of Friendship Values**: It calculates the sum `S` of the friendship values of the given pairs.
   - **Combination Count**: `C` is calculated as the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - **Numerator and Denominator Calculation**: 
     - `num` is calculated as \( p \times k \times k - p \times k + 2 \times k \times C \times S \).
     - `den` is calculated as \( 2 \times C \times C \).
   - **GCD and Simplification**: The GCD of `num` and `den` is found and used to simplify the fraction.
   - **Modular Inverse**: `den` is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` using the modular multiplicative inverse.
   - **Final Answer Calculation**: The final answer is computed as \( num \times den \mod 10^9 + 7 \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the input constraints and processes each test case appropriately.
   - The mathematical operations and formulas used in the program align with the problem statement.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
