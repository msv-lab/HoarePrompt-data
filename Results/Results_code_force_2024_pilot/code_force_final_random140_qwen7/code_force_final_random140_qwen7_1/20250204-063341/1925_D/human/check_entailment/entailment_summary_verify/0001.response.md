### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several key points in the program, but it missed a crucial aspect of the expected value calculation. Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem description in detail:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program calculates the sum `S` of all friendship values `f_i` from the input.
   - This is done using the line `S += int(input().split()[2])` inside the loop for `m`.

3. **Total Possible Pairs:**
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs `C` using the formula `C = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program uses the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values:
     \[
     \text{num} = p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S
     \]
     \[
     \text{den} = 2 \cdot C \cdot C
     \]
   - Here, `p` should be `m`, the number of pairs of friends.

5. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den` using `math.gcd(num, den)`.

6. **Simplification:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction by dividing both `num` and `den` by their GCD.

7. **Modular Inverse:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `den` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `pow(den, -1, MOD)`.

8. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the final answer using the formula:
     \[
     \text{ans} = (\text{num} \times \text{den}^{-1}) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]

### Detailed Analysis:

The original assessment correctly pointed out that the formula for the numerator might be incorrect. Let's derive the correct formula for the expected value:

- For each pair of friends `(a_i, b_i)` with friendship value `f_i`, the expected increase in the friendship value after `k` excursions is `k * (k + 1) / 2`.
- The probability of choosing a specific pair in any excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
- The expected value contribution of each pair `(a_i, b_i)` is:
  \[
  \text{expected\_contribution} = f_i \cdot \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
  \]
- Summing up the contributions for all pairs of friends:
  \[
  \text{total\_expected\_value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{n(n-1)}
  \]
- Simplifying the formula:
  \[
  \text{num} = m \cdot k \cdot (k + 1) \cdot S
  \]
  \[
  \text{den} = n \cdot (n - 1)
  \]

The program's current formula:
\[
\text{num} = p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S
\]
is incorrect because it does not account for the correct expected value contribution.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation as described in the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the potential issues with the formula used for the numerator.
