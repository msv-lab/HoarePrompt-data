Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be greater than 0, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by space for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is `2 * C * C`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * C * C` to the variable `den`. Since `C` is defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is calculated as `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`. The other variables (`i`, `p`, `S`, `C`, `num`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
