Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be a positive integer, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is `math.gcd(num, den)`**

Explanation: The code `num = num // g` divides `num` by the greatest common divisor (`g`) of `num` and `den`. This operation simplifies `num` while keeping `den` unchanged. The values of `i`, `p`, `S`, `C`, `den`, and `g` remain the same as they were not affected by the code. The updated value of `num` is obtained by dividing the original `num` by `g`.
