Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be greater than 0, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by space for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of `num` and `den` using the `math.gcd` function. This operation does not change the values of the other variables, but it introduces a new variable `g` which holds the result of the gcd calculation.
