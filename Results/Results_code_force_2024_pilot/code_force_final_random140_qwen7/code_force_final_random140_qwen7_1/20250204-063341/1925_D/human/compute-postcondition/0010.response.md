Output State: **`p` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `S` is the sum of its previous value and the third element from the list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the third element from the list is converted to an integer and added to `S`.**

This means that `p` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 2, and `S` is updated to include the integer value of the third element from the list of integers entered by the user.
