Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `p`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `p`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `p` must be a positive integer.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < p`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since `i` starts at 1), and `p` must remain a positive integer. However, since `p` is a condition and not directly modified within the loop, its value does not change unless specified otherwise.

5. **New State**: After incrementing `i` by 1, `i` becomes 2. Since `p` remains unchanged and must still be a positive integer, the new state should reflect this.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `p` must be a positive integer**
