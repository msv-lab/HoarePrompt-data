Output State: **`i` is 1, `p` must be greater than 0, `S` is the sum of `S` and the third element from the input split into a list**

Explanation: The code `S += int(input().split()[2])` takes an input, splits it into a list, and adds the third element (index 2) of that list to `S`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
