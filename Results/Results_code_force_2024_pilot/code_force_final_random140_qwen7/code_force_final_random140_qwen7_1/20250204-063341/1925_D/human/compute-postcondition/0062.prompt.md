Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 5⋅10^4, and `MOD` is 1000000007.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, p, k = map(int, input().split())
    S = 0
    for i in range(p):
        S += int(input().split()[2])
    C = n * (n - 1) // 2
    num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
    den = 2 * C * C
    g = math.gcd(num, den)
    num = num // g
    den = den // g
    den = pow(den, -1, MOD)
    ans = num * den % MOD
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `p-1`, `S` is the sum of the third element from each list of integers provided by the input, repeated `p` times, `C` is the product of n and (n-1) divided by 2, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S` divided by the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is simplified by dividing itself with `g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `p-1`, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`, `den` is `2 * C * C // math.gcd(num, den)`, `g` is `math.gcd(num, den)`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `p-1`, `p` must be greater than 0, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by space for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `num // g`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `C * C` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
