Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be a positive integer, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`, `den` is `2 * C * C // math.gcd(num, den)`, `g` is `math.gcd(num, den)`, `den` is the modular inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the modular inverse of `den` using the `pow` function with three arguments: the value of `den`, `-1`, and `MOD`. This means that `den` is updated to its modular inverse under the given modulus `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
