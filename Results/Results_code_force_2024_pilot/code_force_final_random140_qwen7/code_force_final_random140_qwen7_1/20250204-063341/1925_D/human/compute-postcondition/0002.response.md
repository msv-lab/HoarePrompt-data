Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the constant `T`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `T` is greater than 0. Since `T` is given as an input integer and the range is \(1 \leq T \leq 5 \times 10^4\), the only relevant state to adjust is `T` itself.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `T` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Given the constraints, `T` must be a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `T` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` must be greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007**
