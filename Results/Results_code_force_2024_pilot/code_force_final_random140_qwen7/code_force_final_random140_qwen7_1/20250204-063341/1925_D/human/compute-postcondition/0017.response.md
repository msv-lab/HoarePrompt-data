Output State: **`p` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `p-1`, `S` is the sum of the third element from each list of integers provided by the input, repeated `p` times, `C` is the product of n and (n-1) divided by 2, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S` divided by the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.**

Explanation: The code `num = num // g` divides `num` by the greatest common divisor (`g`) of `num` and `den`. This operation simplifies `num` by removing the common factors with `den`, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the division of `num` by `g`, while keeping the other variables as they were in the initial state.
