Output State: **`p` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `p-1`, `S` is the sum of the third element from each list of integers provided by the input, repeated `p` times, `C` is the product of n and (n-1) divided by 2, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S` divided by the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is simplified by dividing itself with `g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**

Explanation: The code calculates `ans` as `num * den % MOD`. It does not change the values of `p`, `i`, `S`, `C`, `num`, `den`, `g`, or `MOD`. Instead, it computes `ans` using the existing values of `num` and `den`. The other variables remain unchanged.
