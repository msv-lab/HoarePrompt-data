Output State: **`p` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `p-1`, `S` is the sum of the third element from each list of integers provided by the input, repeated `p` times, `C` is the product of n and (n-1) divided by 2, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (`g`) of `num` and `den`. The values of `p`, `i`, `S`, `C`, `num`, and `den` remain unchanged, but now `g` is added to the state, representing the gcd of `num` and `den`.
