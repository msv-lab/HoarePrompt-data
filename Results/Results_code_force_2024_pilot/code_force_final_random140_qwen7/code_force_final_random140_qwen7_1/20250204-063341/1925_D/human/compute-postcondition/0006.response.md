Output State: **`p` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `S` is the sum of `S` and the third element from the list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `S += int(input().split()[2])` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, converts the third element (index 2) to an integer, and adds it to the variable `S`. The initial state of `p` and `i` remains unchanged.
