Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`, `den` is `2 * C * C // math.gcd(num, den)`, `g` is `math.gcd(num, den)`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `p`, and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the values of `n`, `p`, and `k` are now known input integers. The other variables (`S`, `C`, `num`, `den`, `g`, and `ans`) remain as they were initially defined, with their values dependent on the new values of `n`, `p`, and `k`.
