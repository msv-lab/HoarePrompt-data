Output State: **`i` is 0, `p` must be a positive integer, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `S += int(input().split()[2])` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and then converts the third element (index 2) of this list into an integer and adds it to the variable `S`. The initial values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
