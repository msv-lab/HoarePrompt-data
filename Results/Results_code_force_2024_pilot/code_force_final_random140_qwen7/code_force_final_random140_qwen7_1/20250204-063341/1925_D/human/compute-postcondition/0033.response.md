Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be a positive integer, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`**.

Explanation: The code assigns a new value to the variable `num` based on the formula `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`. The values of `i`, `p`, `S`, and `C` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the updated value of `num`.
