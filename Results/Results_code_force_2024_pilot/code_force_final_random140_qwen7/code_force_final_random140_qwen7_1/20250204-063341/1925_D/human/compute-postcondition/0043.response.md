Output State: **`S` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`, `den` is `2 * C * C // math.gcd(num, den)`, `g` is `math.gcd(num, den)`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**

Explanation: The line `S = 0` sets the value of `S` to 0. This updates the value of `S` from its initial state as the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
