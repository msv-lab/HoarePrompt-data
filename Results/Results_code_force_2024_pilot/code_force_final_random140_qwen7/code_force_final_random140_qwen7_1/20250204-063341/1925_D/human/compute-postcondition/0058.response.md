Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be greater than 0, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by space for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `num // g`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `C * C` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code snippet calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` which is `C * C` modulo `MOD`. The value of `den` is updated to this modular inverse. All other variables (`i`, `p`, `S`, `C`, `num`, and `g`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
