Output State: **`i` is 2, `p` must be a positive integer, `S` is increased by the third element from the list obtained by splitting the input string and converting it to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `S += int(input().split()[2])` takes an input string, splits it into a list of strings, converts the third element (index 2) of that list to an integer, and adds it to the variable `S`. The initial values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
