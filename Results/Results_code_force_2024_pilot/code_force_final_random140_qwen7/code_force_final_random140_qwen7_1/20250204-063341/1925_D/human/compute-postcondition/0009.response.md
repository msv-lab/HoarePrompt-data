Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `p`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < p`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `S` is the sum of its previous value and the third element from the list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (i.e., `i` becomes 2).
   - For the loop to continue, `p` must remain greater than 0 (since `p` was greater than 0 at the start, it will still be greater than 0 after the increment).

5. **Summarize the new state**:
   - `p` must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `S` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operation modifies `S`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`p` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `S` is the sum of its previous value and the third element from the list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**
