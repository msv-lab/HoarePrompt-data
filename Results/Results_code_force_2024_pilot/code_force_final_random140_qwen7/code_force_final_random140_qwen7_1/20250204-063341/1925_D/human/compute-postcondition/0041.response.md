Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is `p-1`
- `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`
- `den` is `2 * C * C // math.gcd(num, den)`
- `g` is `math.gcd(num, den)`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for _ in range(T):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any state that needs to be adjusted.
- The loop itself does not modify any of the variables listed above.

### Conclusion
Since the loop does not modify any of the variables listed, and there are no other variables involved in the loop head, the states of these variables remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `p-1`, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`, `den` is `2 * C * C // math.gcd(num, den)`, `g` is `math.gcd(num, den)`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**
