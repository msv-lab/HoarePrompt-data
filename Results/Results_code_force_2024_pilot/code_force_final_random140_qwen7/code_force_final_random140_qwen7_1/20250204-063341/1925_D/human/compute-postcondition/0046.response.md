Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(p)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `p`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `p` must be greater than 0
   - `S` is the sum of the third element from input split by space (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `p`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, so for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, `i` will be 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `p` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `p` must remain greater than 0.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `p` must be greater than 0**
