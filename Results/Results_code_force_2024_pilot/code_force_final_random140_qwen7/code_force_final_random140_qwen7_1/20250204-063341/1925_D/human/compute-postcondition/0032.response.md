Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be a positive integer, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`**.

In this output state, the variable `C` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
