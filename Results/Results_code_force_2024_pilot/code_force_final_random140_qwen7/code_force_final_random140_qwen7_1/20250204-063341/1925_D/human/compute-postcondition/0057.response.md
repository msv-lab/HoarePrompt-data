Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be greater than 0, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by space for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `num // g`, `den` is `C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `C * C`**.

Explanation: The code `den = den // g` divides `den` by `g`. Initially, `den` was `2 * C * C`. After dividing `den` by `g`, `den` becomes `C * C`. All other variables remain unchanged.
