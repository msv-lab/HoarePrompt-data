The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes integers \( T \), \( n \), \( p \), and \( k \), along with additional integers \( a_i \), \( b_i \), and \( f_i \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given inputs and prints the result. Specifically, it computes a simplified fraction \( \frac{\text{num}}{\text{den}} \) modulo \( 1000000007 \), where \( \text{num} \) and \( \text{den} \) are derived from the input values, and then prints the numerator of the simplified fraction.
