Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `operations` is increased by `median - a[0]`, assuming `a[i] < median`.
   - If `a[i] >= median`, no change is made to `operations`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 in the range function, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.
   - The condition `a[i] < median` must hold true for the operations to be updated. If `a[1] < median`, then `operations` will be increased by `median - a[1]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the condition for `operations`.

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `operations` is increased by `median - a[1]`, assuming `a[1] < median`. If `a[1] >= median`, no change is made to `operations`.**
