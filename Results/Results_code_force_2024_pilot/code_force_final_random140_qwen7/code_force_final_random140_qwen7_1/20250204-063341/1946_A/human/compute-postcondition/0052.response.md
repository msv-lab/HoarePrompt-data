Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `operations` is the sum of (`median` - a[i]) for all i in the range (0) to (n-1) where a[i] < `median`, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is (n), `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is (n // 2), `median` is a[median_index], `median_index` is updated to n // 2, `median` is a[median_index]**.

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `median` to `a[median_index]`. Since `median_index` is already set to `n // 2`, `median` is now the middle element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
