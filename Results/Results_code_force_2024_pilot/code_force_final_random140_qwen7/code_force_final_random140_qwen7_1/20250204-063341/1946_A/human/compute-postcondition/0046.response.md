Based on the initial state provided:

- `operations` is the sum of \((\text{median} - a[i])\) for all \(i\) in the range \(0\) to \(n-1\) where \(a[i] < \text{median}\).
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `median` is `a[median_index]`.

To determine what will be printed, let's break it down:

1. **`median_index`**: This is the middle index of the list `a`, since `median_index = n // 2`.
2. **`median`**: This is the element at the `median_index` position in the list `a`.
3. **`operations`**: This is the sum of \((\text{median} - a[i])\) for all \(i\) where \(a[i] < \text{median}\).

Given that `i` is `n`, and `n` is at least 1, `i` being `n` means the loop that calculates `operations` would have already completed execution. Therefore, `operations` is already computed and stored.

Since no specific values for `a` are provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `operations`. However, we know that `operations` is the sum of the differences between `median` and all elements in `a` that are less than `median`.

Output: **operations (where operations is the sum of (\text{median} - a[i]) for all i where a[i] < \text{median})**
