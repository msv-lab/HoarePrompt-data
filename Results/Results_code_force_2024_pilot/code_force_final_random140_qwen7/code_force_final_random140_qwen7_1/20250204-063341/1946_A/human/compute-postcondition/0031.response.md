Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - From the given state before the loop starts: `i` is equal to `n + 1`.
   - We need to adjust `i` to match the starting condition of the `range` function, which is typically `0` (inclusive) up to `n` (exclusive).

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is initially set to `n + 1`, the loop will not execute because `i` will never be less than `n` if `i` is `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `i` to `0` and ensure `n` is at least `1` (since `i` should be less than `n` for the loop to run).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`operations` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[median_index]`**
