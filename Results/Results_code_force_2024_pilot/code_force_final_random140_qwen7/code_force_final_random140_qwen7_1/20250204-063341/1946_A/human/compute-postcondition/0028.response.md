Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `operations` is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i]` is less than `median` for `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code calculates the `median_index` which is the index of the median element in the list `a`. This is done by performing integer division (`//`) of `n` by 2. The values of `t`, `i`, `operations`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
