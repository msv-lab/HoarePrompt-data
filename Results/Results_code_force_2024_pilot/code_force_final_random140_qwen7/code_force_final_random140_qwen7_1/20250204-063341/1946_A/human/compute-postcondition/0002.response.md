Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the given state before the loop, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. This means `t` is an integer input from the user.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer. Given that `t` is the result of `int(input())`, we need to make sure that the user inputs a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer, n remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the array `a` remains containing `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**.
