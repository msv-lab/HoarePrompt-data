Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` will remain a positive integer (since `t` test cases were processed and each test case's `n` was handled), and `operations` will be the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i] < median` across all test cases. The variable `t` will be 0 since all test cases have been processed, and `median_index` will be `n // 2` for the last test case processed, with `median` being the middle element of the sorted list `a` for that test case.
