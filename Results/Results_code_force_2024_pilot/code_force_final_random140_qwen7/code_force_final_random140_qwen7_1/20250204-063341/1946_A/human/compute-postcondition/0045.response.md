Output State: **Postcondition: `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[i])` for all `i` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `a[i] < median`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[median_index]`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `operations` will hold the total sum of differences `(median - a[i])` for each element `a[i]` in the list that is less than the median value. The variable `i` will be set to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables (`t`, `median_index`, and `median`) will retain their initial or updated values from the last iteration of the loop.
