Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, and the array `a` is sorted in ascending order containing `n` integers where each integer is an input separated by spaces; `p` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1.**

This means that the variable `p` has been calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the array `a` remains sorted in ascending order with `n` integers.
