Output State: **`operations` is updated to `median - a[1]` if `a[1]` is less than `median`, otherwise it retains the previous value; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `median` is `a[median_index]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `operations` is now `operations + (median - a[i])`.**

This means that the value of `operations` has been updated by adding the difference between `median` and `a[i]` to its current value. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
