Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the array `a` remains containing `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    a.sort()
    p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
    res = a[p:].count(a[p])
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, the array `a` is sorted in ascending order containing `n` integers where each integer is an input separated by spaces, `p` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, and `res` is the count of `a[p]` in the subarray `a[p:]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer - 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `p` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, and `res` is the count of `a[p]` in the subarray `a[p:]`. `res` is also the count of `a[p]` in the list `a[p:]` after executing `res = a[p:].count(a[p])`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0 or greater, `n` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `res` is the count of `a[p]` in the subarray `a[p:]` (now `res` is set to the count of `a[p]` in the subarray `a[p:]`)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
