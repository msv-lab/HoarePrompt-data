Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `operations` is the sum of (`median` - a[i]) for all i in the range (0) to (n-1) where a[i] < `median`, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is (n), `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is (n // 2), `median` is a[median_index], `median_index` is updated to n // 2**

The code updates the value of `median_index` to `n // 2`, which is the same as its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged.
