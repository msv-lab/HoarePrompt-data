Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `operations` is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i]` is less than `median` for `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `operations`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
