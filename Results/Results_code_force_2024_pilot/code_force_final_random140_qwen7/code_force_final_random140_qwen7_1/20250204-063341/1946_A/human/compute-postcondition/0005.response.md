Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, and the array `a` is sorted in ascending order containing `n` integers where each integer is an input separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the array `a` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the array `a` is updated to be sorted.
