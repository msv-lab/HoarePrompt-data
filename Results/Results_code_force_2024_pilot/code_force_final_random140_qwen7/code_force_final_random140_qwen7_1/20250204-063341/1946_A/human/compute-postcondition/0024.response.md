Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (positive), an integer `n` (between 1 and 10^5 inclusive), and an array `a` containing `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). The function returns different values based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own `t`, `n`, and array `a`. For each test case, it processes `t`, `n`, and `a` according to the given constraints and returns a specific value or result based on the conditions provided.
