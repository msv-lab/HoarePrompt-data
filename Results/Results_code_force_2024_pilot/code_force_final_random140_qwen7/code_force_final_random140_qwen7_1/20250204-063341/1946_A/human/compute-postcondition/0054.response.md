Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `n` should be a positive integer because `range(n)` requires `n` to be a non-negative integer.

3. **Consider the given states**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `operations` is 0.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is currently `(n)`, which seems to be a placeholder for the value of `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `median_index` is `(n // 2)`, which is the middle index of the list `a`.
   - `median` is `a[median_index]`.
   - `median_index` is updated to `n // 2`.
   - `median` is `a[median_index]`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` should be initialized to 0, we need to adjust `i` to 0.
   - Since `n` should be a positive integer, we need to ensure `n` is a positive integer.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
