Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer, n is an input integer, and the array `a` remains containing `n` integers where 1 â‰¤ a_i â‰¤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input().strip())` reads an integer input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` and the array `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
