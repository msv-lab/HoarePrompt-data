Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. It sorts the array, finds the median, and calculates the total number of operations needed to make all elements in the array less than or equal to the median. After processing all test cases, it prints the cumulative total of operations across all test cases.**
