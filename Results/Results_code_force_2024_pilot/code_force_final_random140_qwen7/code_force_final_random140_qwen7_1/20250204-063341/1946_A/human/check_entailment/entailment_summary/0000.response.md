Reasoning:
1. The provided program only counts the occurrences of the median value in the sorted array, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
2. To correctly solve the problem, we need to compare the current median with the next higher value in the sorted array and calculate the difference between them. The number of operations needed will be the difference between the target median value and the current median value, considering the smallest number of changes required.
3. The program should identify the median position and check if the current median needs to be increased. If the current median is less than the next higher value, the number of operations required would be the difference between the next higher value and the current median.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic to actually increase the median and count the minimum number of operations needed.

Correctness: **False**
