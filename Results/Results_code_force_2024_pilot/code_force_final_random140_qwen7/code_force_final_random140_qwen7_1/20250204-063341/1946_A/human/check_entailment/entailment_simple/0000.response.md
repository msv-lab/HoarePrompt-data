Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current implementation simply counts how many times the middle element appears in the second half of the sorted array, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

Hereâ€™s the detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Requirement**: The goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array. This means we need to ensure that the median becomes strictly greater than its current value.

2. **Current Implementation**: The code sorts the array and then counts the occurrences of the middle element in the second half of the sorted array. This does not address the requirement to increase the median.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
   - Find the median of the array.
   - Determine the smallest number that is greater than the current median.
   - Count the number of elements that are less than or equal to the current median and need to be incremented to reach the next higher value.

Let's modify the function accordingly:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        
        # If the array has an odd number of elements, the median is a[p]
        # If the array has an even number of elements, the median is between a[p] and a[p+1]
        if n % 2 == 1:
            target = a[p] + 1
        else:
            target = a[p] + 1
        
        # Count the number of elements that are less than or equal to the current median
        res = sum(1 for x in a if x <= a[p])
        
        # The result is the number of elements that need to be incremented
        print(res)
```

Given the above explanation and the modified function, the initial implementation was incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
