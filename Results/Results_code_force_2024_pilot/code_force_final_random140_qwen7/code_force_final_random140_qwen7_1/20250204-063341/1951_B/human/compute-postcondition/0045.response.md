Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `wins` is 100001.
   - `wins_with_swap` is 100100.
   - `i` is 101000.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:
   - First, let's evaluate the expression inside the `max` function:
     - `wins - 1`: This is `100001 - 1 = 100000`.
     - `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)`: 
       - `wins_with_swap - wins - 1`: This is `100100 - 100001 - 1 = 99`.
       - `(wins > 0)`: Since `wins` is 100001, this condition evaluates to `True`, which is equivalent to `1` in Python.
       - Therefore, `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0) = 99 + 1 = 100`.

4. **Determine the Maximum Value**:
   - Now we need to find the maximum of `100000` and `100`.
   - Clearly, `100000` is greater than `100`.

Therefore, the expression inside the `max` function evaluates to `100000`, and this is what will be printed.

Output: **100000**
