Output State: `wins` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 3.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `wins` as long as `a[i]` is less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`. After the loop has executed 3 times, it means that the first 3 elements of the list `a` are all less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`. Since the loop breaks when `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, and we know it has run for 3 iterations without breaking, it implies that the fourth element (when `i` is 3) is the first element that is greater than `a[k - 1]`. Therefore, `wins` remains 3 after all iterations.
