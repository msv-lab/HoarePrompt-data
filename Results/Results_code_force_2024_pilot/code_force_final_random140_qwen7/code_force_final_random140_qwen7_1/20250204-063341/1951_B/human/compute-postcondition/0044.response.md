Output State: `wins` is 100001, `wins_with_swap` is 100100, `i` is 101000.

Explanation: The loop runs from `wins_with_swap` (which starts at 100001) to `k-1`. Given that the loop executes 3 times as per the provided information, we can infer that `wins_with_swap` will increment by 1 each iteration until it reaches `k-1`. If the loop executed 3 times, `wins_with_swap` would start at 100001 and end at 100013. Since the loop continues to increment `wins_with_swap` until it reaches `k-1`, and given the pattern, if the loop were to execute all its iterations, `wins_with_swap` would reach 100100 (incrementing from 100001 to 100100, which is 100 increments). The variable `i` would then be equal to `wins_with_swap` at the last increment, making it 101000. The value of `wins` remains unchanged at 100001 as it is not affected by the loop.
