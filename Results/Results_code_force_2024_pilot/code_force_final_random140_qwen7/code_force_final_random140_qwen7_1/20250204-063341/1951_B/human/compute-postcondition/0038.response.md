Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `wins_with_swap`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `wins` is 100001
   - `wins_with_swap` is 100012
   - `i` is 100001

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 100001 and the loop condition is `i < k - 1`, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body increments `i`).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 100002.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` (which is now 100002) must still be less than `k - 1`.
   - This means `k - 1` must be greater than 100002.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 100002.
   - `wins_with_swap` remains unchanged because it is not used in the loop condition.
   - `wins` remains unchanged because it is not used in the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`wins` is 100001, `wins_with_swap` is 100012, `i` is 100002**
