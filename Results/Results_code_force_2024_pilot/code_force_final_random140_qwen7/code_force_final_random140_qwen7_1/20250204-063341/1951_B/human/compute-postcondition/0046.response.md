Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t`, and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers where each integer in `a` is between 1 and 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_1` takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` and a list `a` containing `n` distinct integers. The function then performs some operations based on these inputs and returns a result for each test case.
