Postcondition: **`wins` is 100000, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 99999, and the condition `wins >= k` is true.**

This means that after executing the if-else block, `wins` will be 100000, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations (from 0 to 99999). The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged, and `i` is set to 99999. The condition `wins >= k` is true, confirming that the loop has run through all elements in the list `a` without finding any element greater than `a[k-1]`.
