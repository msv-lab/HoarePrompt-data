Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `n` and `k` are assigned the values from input split by space.**

In this output state, the variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 10^4. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, with `n` being an integer in the range 2 to 10^5 and `k` being an integer in the range 1 to `n`.
