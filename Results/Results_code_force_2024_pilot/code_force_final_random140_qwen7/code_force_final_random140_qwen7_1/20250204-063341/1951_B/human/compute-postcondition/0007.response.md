Postcondition: `wins` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, then we break out of the loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[k - 1]`, then the same conditions hold without any change.
