Output State: **`wins` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The line `wins += 1` increments the value of `wins` by 1. Since the initial value of `wins` was 2, after executing this line, `wins` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
