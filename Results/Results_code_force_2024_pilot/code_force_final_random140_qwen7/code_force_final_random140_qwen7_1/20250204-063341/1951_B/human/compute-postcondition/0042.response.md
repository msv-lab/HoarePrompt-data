Output State: **`wins` is 100001, `wins_with_swap` is 100013, `i` is 100002**

Explanation: The variable `wins_with_swap` is incremented by 1. Initially, `wins_with_swap` was 100012, so after executing `wins_with_swap += 1`, its value becomes 100013. The values of `wins` and `i` remain unchanged at 100001 and 100002, respectively.
