Reasoning:
- The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through all possible values of \( b \) from 1 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \).
- For each \( b \), it calculates \( n // b + 1 \) and adds it to the answer `ans`.
- However, the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is not correctly implemented in the program. The program simply counts the number of integers \( a \) such that \( 1 \leq a \leq n \) and \( 1 \leq b \leq m \), which does not satisfy the given condition.
- The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if they satisfy the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
