Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on a specific formula \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but it does not actually check this condition. Instead, it simply counts how many times \(n // b + 1\) holds true, which does not align with the problem's requirements.
- The program should iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). If it is, then the pair is counted towards the answer.

Correctness: **False**
