Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates `ans` using the formula `ans = ans + n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. However, this approach does not accurately count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To illustrate, consider the test case `(n, m) = (10, 8)`:
- According to the problem description, valid pairs include `(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 3), (10, 4)`, which totals 16 pairs.
- However, the program outputs `14`, indicating it is missing some valid pairs.

A correct implementation would involve checking each pair `(a, b)` within the specified ranges and verifying whether the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds true. The current implementation does not perform this check and thus fails to produce the correct results for many test cases.
