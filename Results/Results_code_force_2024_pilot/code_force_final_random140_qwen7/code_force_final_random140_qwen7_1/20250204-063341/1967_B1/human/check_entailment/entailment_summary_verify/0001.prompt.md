You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + n // b + 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of \( n // b + 1 \) for every integer \( b \) ranging from 1 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \), inclusive. The function prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read and split into separate integers.

2. **Calculating the Answer:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
   - A loop runs from `b = 1` to `min(n, m)`.
   - Inside the loop, `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1`.

### Checking the Logic

#### Key Points to Verify:
- **Condition Verification:** The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be checked.
- **Calculation of `ans`:** The current logic does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Current Logic:**
   - The current logic counts the number of multiples of `b` within the range `[1, n]` and adds 1 (to include `b` itself).
   - This approach does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - For each valid pair \((a, b)\), we should increment the counter.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Verification

- The corrected program iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition.
- It correctly counts the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly implement the required logic. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
