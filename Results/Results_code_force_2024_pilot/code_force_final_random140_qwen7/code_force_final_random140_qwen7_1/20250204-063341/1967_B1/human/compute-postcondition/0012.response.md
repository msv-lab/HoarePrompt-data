Output State: The value of `ans` will be the sum of `n // b + 1` for every integer `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)` inclusive. In other words, `ans` will be the sum of `n // 1 + 1`, `n // 2 + 1`, ..., up to `n // min(n, m) + 1`.

This means that `ans` will be calculated as follows: 
\[ \text{ans} = (n // 1 + 1) + (n // 2 + 1) + \cdots + (n // \text{min}(n, m) + 1) \]

The final value of `ans` will depend on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but it will always be the sum of each integer division of `n` by every integer from 1 up to the minimum of `n` and `m`, plus the number of terms in the summation.
