Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    [n, m] = input().split()
    [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
    ans = 0
    for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
        ans = ans + n // b + 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The value of `ans` will be the sum of `n // b + 1` for every integer `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)` inclusive. In other words, `ans` will be the sum of `n // 1 + 1`, `n // 2 + 1`, ..., up to `n // min(n, m) + 1`.

This means that `ans` will be calculated as follows: 
\[ \text{ans} = (n // 1 + 1) + (n // 2 + 1) + \cdots + (n // \text{min}(n, m) + 1) \]

The final value of `ans` will depend on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but it will always be the sum of each integer division of `n` by every integer from 1 up to the minimum of `n` and `m`, plus the number of terms in the summation.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `T` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `T` remains 1, `n` and `m` retain their initial values, `b` will be equal to the smallest value between `n` and `m` plus one, and `ans` will be the sum of `n // b + 1` for every `b` starting from 1 up to the minimum of `n` and `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `b` is `min(n, m) + 1` and `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `b` will be equal to `min(n, m) + 1`. The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of `n // b + 1` for every integer value of `b` starting from 1 up to and including `min(n, m)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
