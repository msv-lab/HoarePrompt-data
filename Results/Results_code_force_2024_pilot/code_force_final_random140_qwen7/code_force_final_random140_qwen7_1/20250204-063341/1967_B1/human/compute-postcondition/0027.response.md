Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `T` in the range `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `T < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `T` is 1
   - `n` is an integer from the input
   - `m` is an integer from the input
   - `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`
   - `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `T` starts at 1, after one iteration, `T` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The values of `n`, `m`, `b`, and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop body (as per the given information).

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `T` will be 2.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `b` remains `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - `ans` remains the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`T` is 2, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)`**.
