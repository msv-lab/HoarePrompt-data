Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1)`. This means the variable `b` is being iterated over a range starting from 1 up to `min(n, m) + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m) + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated by the expression `ans + n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1`.
   - `b` is set to `min(n, m) + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `b` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `b` would be `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1, making it `min(n, m) + 2`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no other operations are specified.
   - `b` needs to be `min(n, m) + 2`.

6. **Final state**:
   - `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `b` is now `min(n, m) + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ans` is `ans + n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 2`**
