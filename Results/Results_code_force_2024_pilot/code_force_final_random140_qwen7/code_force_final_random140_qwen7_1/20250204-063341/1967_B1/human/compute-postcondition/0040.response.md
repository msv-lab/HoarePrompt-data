Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `b` is set to `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.

2. **Understanding `b`**:
   - `b` is initially set to `min(n, m) + 1`.

3. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.
   - This means we need to iterate over `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)` and add `n // b + 1` to `ans` for each `b`.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - For each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`, we calculate `n // b + 1` and add it to `ans`.
   - When `b` reaches `min(n, m) + 1`, the loop stops because `b` exceeds `min(n, m)`.

5. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - The final value of `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.

Given this understanding, let's consider the final state:

- `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.
- `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.

Since `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, the loop does not execute any iteration because `b` starts from 1 and goes up to `min(n, m)`, but it never reaches `min(n, m) + 1` during the loop. Therefore, `ans` remains 0.

Thus, the print statement will output the value of `ans`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
