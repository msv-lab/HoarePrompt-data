Output State: `b` is `min(n, m) + 1` and `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `b` will be equal to `min(n, m) + 1`. The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of `n // b + 1` for every integer value of `b` starting from 1 up to and including `min(n, m)`.
