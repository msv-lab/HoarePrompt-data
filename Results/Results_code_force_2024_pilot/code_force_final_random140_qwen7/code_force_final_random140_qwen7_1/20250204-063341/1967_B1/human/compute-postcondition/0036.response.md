Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `b` is `min(n, m) + 2`
- `ans` is `ans + n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1 + n // b + 1`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `b` from `1` to `min(n, m)`.
2. **Current Value of `b`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is `min(n, m) + 2`.

Since the loop runs from `1` to `min(n, m)` inclusive, and `b` is currently `min(n, m) + 2`, it means that the value of `b` exceeds the upper bound of the loop (`min(n, m)`).

### Conclusion
The loop cannot execute again because the current value of `b` (`min(n, m) + 2`) is greater than `min(n, m)`, which is the upper limit of the loop.

### Updated State
Since the loop cannot execute again, no adjustments are needed for the loop variables. The only state that needs to be considered is the state of `ans`, which remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

**State:**
- `b` is `min(n, m) + 2`
- `ans` is `ans + n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1 + n // b + 1`

However, since the loop cannot execute again, the final state remains as follows:

**State:**
- `b` is `min(n, m) + 2`
- `ans` is `ans + n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1 + n // (min(n, m) + 2) + 1`

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`b` is `min(n, m) + 2`, `ans` is `ans + n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1 + n // (min(n, m) + 2) + 1**
