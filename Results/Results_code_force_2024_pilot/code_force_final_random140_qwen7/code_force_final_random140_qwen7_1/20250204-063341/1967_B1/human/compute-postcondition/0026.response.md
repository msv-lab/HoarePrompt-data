Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n // b + 1 for each b in the range from 1 to min(n, m))**

Explanation:
- `T` is explicitly stated to remain 1, so it does not affect the calculation.
- `n` and `m` retain their initial values.
- `b` is defined as `min(n, m) + 1`.
- `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)`.

Given these definitions, the print statement will output the computed value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.
