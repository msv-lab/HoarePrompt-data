You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 1 and will continue to decrease until it reaches 0, at which point the loop will terminate. At each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input provided by the user. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be 1, and `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not follow the problem description correctly. According to the problem description, the output should be the minimum value followed by the maximum value for each test case. However, the program currently prints the maximum value followed by the minimum value. For example, for the input `1 9`, the expected output is `1 9` but the program outputs `9 1`. This discrepancy means the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
