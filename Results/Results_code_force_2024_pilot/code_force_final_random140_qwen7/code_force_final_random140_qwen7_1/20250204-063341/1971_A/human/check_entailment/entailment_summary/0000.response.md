Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It then iterates `t` times, reading pairs of integers `a` and `b` for each test case.
- For each pair, it calculates the maximum and minimum values using the `max()` and `min()` functions, respectively.
- It prints the maximum value followed by the minimum value for each test case.
- The execution summary indicates that after processing all test cases, `t` is set to 1, which should not happen if all cases were processed. However, this does not affect the correctness of the individual test cases' outputs.

Given that the program produces the correct output for each test case as described in the example, and there is no indication that the overall structure or logic of the program is flawed, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
