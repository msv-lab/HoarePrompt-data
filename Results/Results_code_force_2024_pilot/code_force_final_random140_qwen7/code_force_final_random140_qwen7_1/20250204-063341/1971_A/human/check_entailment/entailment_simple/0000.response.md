Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. It then iterates `t` times, reading pairs of integers `x` and `y` for each test case.
3. For each pair, it calculates the maximum and minimum values and prints them in the required format.
4. The logic inside the loop is correct: it uses `max(a, b)` to find the maximum value and `min(a, b)` to find the minimum value, and prints them in the correct order.
5. The loop runs exactly `t` times, ensuring that all test cases are processed.
6. The final state of the program matches the expected behavior, where `t` is decremented to zero after processing all test cases.

Given the above points, the provided program correctly implements the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
