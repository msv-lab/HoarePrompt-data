### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line of input.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: It then iterates `t` times, processing each test case individually.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b`.
4. **Finding Maximum and Minimum**: It uses the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions to find the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b`, respectively.
5. **Output Formatting**: It prints the results in the required format, with the maximum value first, followed by the minimum value.

Given that the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all specified constraints (number of test cases, range of input values), it should produce the correct output for any valid input.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
