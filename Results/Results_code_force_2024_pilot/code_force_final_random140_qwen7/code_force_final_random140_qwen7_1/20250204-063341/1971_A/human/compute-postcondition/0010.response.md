Output State: `t` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be reduced to 1 and will continue to decrease until it reaches 0, at which point the loop will terminate. At the final iteration, `t` will be 1, and `a` and `b` will be the values input by the user for that last iteration.
