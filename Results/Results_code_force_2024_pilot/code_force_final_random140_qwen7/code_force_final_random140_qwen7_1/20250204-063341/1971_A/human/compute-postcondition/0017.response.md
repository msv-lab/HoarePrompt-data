Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `b` is an input integer
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, `a` is adjusted to be either equal to `b` or less than `b`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body.
   - The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume these values stay the same.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` is still 0
   - `n` must still be greater than 0
   - `i` is now 1
   - `a` is still an input integer
   - `b` is still an input integer
   - The condition regarding `a` and `b` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and if `a` is greater than `b`, then the condition holds as is. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is adjusted accordingly (either equal to `b` or less than `b`).**
