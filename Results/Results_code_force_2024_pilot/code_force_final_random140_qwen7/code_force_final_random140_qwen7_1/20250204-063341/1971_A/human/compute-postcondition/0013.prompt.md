You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 1 and will continue to decrease until it reaches 0, at which point the loop will terminate. At each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input provided by the user. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be 1, and `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, it processes two integers `x` and `y` where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9. Based on these inputs, the function returns different outputs depending on the values of `x` and `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
