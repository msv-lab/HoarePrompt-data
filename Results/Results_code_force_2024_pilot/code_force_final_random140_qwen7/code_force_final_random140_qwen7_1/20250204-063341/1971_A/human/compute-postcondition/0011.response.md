Output State: `t` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.

After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 1 and will continue to decrease until it reaches 0, at which point the loop will terminate. At each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input provided by the user. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be 1, and `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user.
