Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `a` is adjusted to be equal to `b` or less than `b` depending on the input.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a, ' ', b)
```

Since `a` is adjusted to be equal to `b` or less than `b` depending on the input, the exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the specific input provided. However, the format of the output is clear: it will print the value of `a` followed by a space and then the value of `b`.

Output: **[a] [b]** (where [a] is the input integer adjusted to be equal to [b] or less than [b], and [b] is the input integer)
