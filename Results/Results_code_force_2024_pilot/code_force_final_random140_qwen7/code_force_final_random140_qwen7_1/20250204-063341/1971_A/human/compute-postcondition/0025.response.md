Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` is an input integer that is adjusted to be equal to `b` or less than `b` depending on the input.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` becomes 2).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.
   - The postcondition that `n` must be greater than 0 still holds true.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from the previous state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `a` is an input integer that is adjusted to be equal to `b` or less than `b` depending on the input.**
