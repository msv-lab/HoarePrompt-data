Output State: **`t` is equal to the previous value of `t` - 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the integers entered by the user separated by a space.**

This means that `t` retains its previous value (which is one less than its current value), while `a` and `b` are now integers obtained from user input, split by a space.
