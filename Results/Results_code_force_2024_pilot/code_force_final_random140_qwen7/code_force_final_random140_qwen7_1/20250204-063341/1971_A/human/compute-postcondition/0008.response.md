Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

This means that the variable `t` remains unchanged at 1, while `a` and `b` are now assigned the integer values obtained from the user input, split and converted to integers using the `map(int, input().split())` function.
