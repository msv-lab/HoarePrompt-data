State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. The initial state given is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
4. Since the loop requires `t` to be greater than 0, and given that `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), the only adjustment needed is to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0.
