Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `a` is an integer from the input
- `b` is an integer from the input
- `a` is either equal to `b` or less than `b`

The `print(a, ' ', b)` statement will print the values of `a` and `b` separated by a space. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, they will be represented as `a` and `b` in the output.

Output: **a b**
