Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and `t` is now the integer input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(max(a, b), min(a, b))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is equal to the previous value of `t` - 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the integers entered by the user separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
