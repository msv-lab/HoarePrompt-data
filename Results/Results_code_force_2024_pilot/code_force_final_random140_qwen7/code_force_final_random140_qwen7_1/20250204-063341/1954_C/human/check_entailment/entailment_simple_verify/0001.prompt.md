You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: All elements of `a` and `b` have been processed, and `i` is now equal to `len(a)`. The variable `kq1` contains a string where each differing pair of elements from `a` and `b` is represented by the larger number followed by the smaller number, and `kq2` contains a string where each differing pair is represented by the smaller number followed by the larger number. If two elements at the same index in `a` and `b` are the same, their string representation is appended to `kq1` and `kq2` without any change. The variable `vt` remains 1 after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` representing the integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two empty strings `kq1` and `kq2` are initialized to store the modified versions of `a` and `b`.
   - An integer `vt` is initialized to 0 to track whether a swap has occurred.

3. **Digit-wise Comparison and Swapping:**
   - A loop runs through the length of string `a` (or `b`, since they are of the same length).
   - For each digit at position `i`:
     - If the digits at position `i` in `a` and `b` are the same, both `kq1` and `kq2` append this digit.
     - If the digits are different, the smaller digit is appended to `kq1` and the larger digit is appended to `kq2`.
     - The variable `vt` is used to ensure that the first differing pair of digits is swapped correctly.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all digits, the program prints the modified strings `kq1` and `kq2`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Handling Digits:**
   - The program correctly identifies and swaps the smallest and largest digits between corresponding positions in `a` and `b` when they differ.
   - This ensures that the product of the resulting numbers is maximized.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the digits are the same, no swap occurs, which is correct.
   - The use of `vt` ensures that the first differing pair is swapped correctly, even if subsequent pairs are also different.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirement: two lines per test case, with the modified values of `x` and `y`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping digits where necessary. It handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
