Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers, and the `(i)`-th element of `a` is either equal to the `(i)`-th element of `b`, in which case the loop continues with the next iteration, or not equal to the `(i)`-th element of `b`. If they are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`. Regardless of the value of `vt`, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of either `x` or `y` (depending on the value of `vt`). `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `a[i]` to itself. If `a[i] != b[i]`, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` or `y` to its previous value, and `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` or `x` to itself, depending on the value of `vt`.**
