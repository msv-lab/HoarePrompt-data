Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `i` is `i + 1`. Depending on the value of `a[i]` and `b[i]`:
- If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `kq1` concatenated with the integer at index `i` of list `a`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of `kq2` and the integer at index `i` of list `a` concatenated together.
- If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, then `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. Depending on the value of `vt`:
  - If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together, with `kq2` further augmented by the string representation of `y`.
  - If `vt` is 1, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together, with `kq2` further augmented by the string representation of `y`.
