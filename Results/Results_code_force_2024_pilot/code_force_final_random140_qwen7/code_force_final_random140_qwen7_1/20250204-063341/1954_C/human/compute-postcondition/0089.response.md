Output State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[1]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `y` to `kq1`. Since `kq1` was initially a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`, after appending `str(y)`, `kq1` now contains the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y` twice. The other variables remain unchanged.
