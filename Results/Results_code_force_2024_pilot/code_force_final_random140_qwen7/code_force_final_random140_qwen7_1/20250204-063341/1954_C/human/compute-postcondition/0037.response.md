Postcondition: `kq1` is the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of either `x` or `y`. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value (an empty string) and the string representation of the other variable (`y` or `x`). `vt` is 1, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a non-empty string, and `b` is an input string. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` is updated to `kq2 + a[i]`. Otherwise, `kq1` is updated to the concatenation of its original value and either the string representation of `x` or `y`.
