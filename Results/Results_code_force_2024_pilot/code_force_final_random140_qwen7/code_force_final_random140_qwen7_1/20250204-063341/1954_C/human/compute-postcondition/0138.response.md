Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers, and the `(i)`-th element of `a` is either equal to the `(i)`-th element of `b`, in which case the loop continues with the next iteration, or not equal to the `(i)`-th element of `b`; if they are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`; regardless of the value of `vt`, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `a[i]`; `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together.**

Explanation: The line `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` appends the string representation of `a[i]` to `kq1`. The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `vt`, and `kq2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
