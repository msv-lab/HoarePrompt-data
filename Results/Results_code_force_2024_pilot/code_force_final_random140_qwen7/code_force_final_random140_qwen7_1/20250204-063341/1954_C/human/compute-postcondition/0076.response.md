Output State: **`i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`; `kq1` is the concatenation of `kq1` and the string representation of `y`.**

In this step, the value of `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
