Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`; `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`; `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`.
