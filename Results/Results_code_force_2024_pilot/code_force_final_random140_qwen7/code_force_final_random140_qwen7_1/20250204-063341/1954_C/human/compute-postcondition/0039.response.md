Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is being incremented in each iteration.
   - The loop condition is `i < len(a)`.

2. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(a)`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be set to `i + 1`.
   - All other variables (`kq1`, `kq2`, `x`, `y`, `vt`, `t`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - `kq1` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `kq2` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `x` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `y` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `vt` remains 1 as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `t` remains greater than or equal to 1 as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `b` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.

Based on this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`kq1` is either the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`, followed by `a[i]`, or the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq2` is updated to either `kq2 + a[i]` or `kq2 + b[i]` depending on which one is chosen. `vt` is 1; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is an input string; `i` is `i + 1`; for all indices `i+1`, `a[i+1]` is not equal to `b[i+1]`**.
