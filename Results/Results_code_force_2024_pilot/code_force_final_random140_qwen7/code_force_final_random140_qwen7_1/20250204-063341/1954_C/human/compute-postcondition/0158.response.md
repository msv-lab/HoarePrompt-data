Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `y` to `kq1`. Since `kq1` originally included the string representation of `x` or `y` depending on the value of `vt`, now it includes the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
