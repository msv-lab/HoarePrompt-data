Postcondition: `kq1` is an empty string, `x` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and for all indices `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.
