Output State: **`kq1` is the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`, followed by `a[i]`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`; `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value (an empty string) and the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is now updated to `kq2 + a[i]`, and we continue the loop.**

This means that the loop continues without any changes to the values of the variables `kq1`, `x`, `y`, and `kq2`. The concatenation operations and the assignment of `x` and `y` remain as they were before the `continue` statement.
