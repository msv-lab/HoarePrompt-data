Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`; `kq1` is `kq1 + a[i]`; `kq2` is `kq2 + a[i]`.**

The code updates `kq2` by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. Since `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the value of `kq2` is now `kq2 + a[i]`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `kq1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
