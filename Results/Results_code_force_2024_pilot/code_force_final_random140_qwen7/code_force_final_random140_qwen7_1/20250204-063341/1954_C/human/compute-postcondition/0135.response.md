Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists. If the `i`-th element of `a` is equal to the `i`-th element of `b`, the loop continues with the next iteration, and `kq1` and `kq2` remain unchanged as they were incremented by the same value. If the `i`-th element of `a` is not equal to the `i`-th element of `b`, `x` is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`. Regardless of the value of `vt`, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of either `x` or `y` (depending on the value of `vt`), and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together.
