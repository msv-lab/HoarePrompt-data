Output State: **`kq1` is the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`, followed by `a[i]`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`; `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value (an empty string) and the string representation of `y`; `vt` is 1; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is an input string; for all indices `i+1`, `a[i+1]` is not equal to `b[i+1]`**.

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` appends the character `a[i]` to the string `kq1`. Given the initial state, `kq1` was either the string `x` or the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`. After appending `a[i]`, `kq1` now becomes the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`, followed by `a[i]`. The values of `x`, `y`, `kq2`, `vt`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
