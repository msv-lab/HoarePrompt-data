Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to `b[len(a) - 1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[len(a) - 1])` and `int(b[len(a) - 1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[len(a) - 1])` and `int(b[len(a) - 1])`, `q` is `t - 2` if `q` was `t - 1` in the previous iteration, otherwise `q` is `q + 1`, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `kq2 = ''` initializes `kq2` as an empty string. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `i`, `len(a)`, `a[len(a) - 1]`, `b[len(a) - 1]`, `x`, `y`, `q`, `b`, and `kq1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
