Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `kq1` concatenated with the integer at index `i` of list `a`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of `kq2` and the integer at index `i` of list `a` concatenated together.**

In this output state, the value of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The variable `kq1` remains a string that includes the string representation of `kq1` concatenated with the integer at index `i` of list `a`. Similarly, `kq2` is updated to include the string representations of `kq2` and the integer at index `i` of list `a` concatenated together.
