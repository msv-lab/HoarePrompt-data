Output State: **`kq1` is now the concatenation of its original value (an empty string) and the string representation of `y`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` concatenates the string representation of `x` to `kq2`. The values of `kq1`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state, where `kq1` is the concatenation of its original value (an empty string) and the string representation of `y`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.
