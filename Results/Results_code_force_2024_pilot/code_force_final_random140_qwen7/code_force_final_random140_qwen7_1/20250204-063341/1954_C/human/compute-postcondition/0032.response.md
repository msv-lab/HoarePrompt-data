Output State: **`kq1` is the concatenation of its original value (either `x` or the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`) and the string representation of `x`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value (an empty string) and the string representation of `y`; `vt` is 1; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is an input string; for all indices `i+1`, `a[i+1]` is not equal to `b[i+1]` and `x` is now the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is now the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + str(x)` updates `kq1` by appending the string representation of `x` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.
