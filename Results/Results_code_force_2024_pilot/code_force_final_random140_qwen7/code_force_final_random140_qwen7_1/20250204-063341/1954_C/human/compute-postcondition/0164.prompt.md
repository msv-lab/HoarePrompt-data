Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to `b[len(a) - 1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[len(a) - 1])` and `int(b[len(a) - 1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[len(a) - 1])` and `int(b[len(a) - 1])`, `q` is `t - 2` if `q` was `t - 1` in the previous iteration, otherwise `q` is `q + 1`, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and the `i`-th element of `a` is either equal to the `i`-th element of `b`, in which case the loop continues with the next iteration, or not equal to the `i`-th element of `b`; if they are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`; regardless of the value of `vt`, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of either `x` or `y` (depending on the value of `vt`); `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and the `(i)`-th element of `a` is either equal to the `(i)`-th element of `b`, in which case the loop continues with the next iteration, or not equal to the `(i)`-th element of `b`. If they are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`. Regardless of the value of `vt`, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of either `x` or `y` (depending on the value of `vt`). `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `a[i]` to itself. If `a[i] != b[i]`, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` or `y` to its previous value, and `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` or `x` to itself, depending on the value of `vt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `i` is `i + 1`. Depending on the value of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `x` and `y` are defined as follows: if `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `kq1` concatenated with the integer at index `i` of list `a`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of `kq2` and the integer at index `i` of list `a` concatenated together. If `a[i] != b[i]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. Depending on the value of `vt`:
- If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together, with `kq2` further augmented by the string representation of `y`.
- If `vt` is 1, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together, with `kq2` further augmented by the string representation of `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
