Output State: **`x` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string**.

The code `b = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `b`. The values of `x`, `y`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
