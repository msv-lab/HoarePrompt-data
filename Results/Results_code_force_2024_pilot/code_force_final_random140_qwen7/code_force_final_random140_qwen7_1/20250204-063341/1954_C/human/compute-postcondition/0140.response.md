The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. In this context, since the `continue` statement is used within a loop, it means that the loop will continue to iterate over the elements of `a` and `b`, checking each pair of elements until the end of the lists.

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers.
- For each pair of elements `(a[i], b[i])`, if they are equal, the loop continues with the next iteration.
- If they are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.
- `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `a[i]`.
- `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together.
- `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `a[i]` to itself.

Since the `continue` statement is used, none of the variables `x`, `y`, `kq1`, or `kq2` are updated during the current iteration of the loop. The loop will simply move on to the next iteration without updating these variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers, and the `(i)`-th element of `a` is either equal to the `(i)`-th element of `b`, in which case the loop continues with the next iteration, or not equal to the `(i)`-th element of `b`; if they are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`; `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `a[i]`; `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together; `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `a[i]` to itself.**
