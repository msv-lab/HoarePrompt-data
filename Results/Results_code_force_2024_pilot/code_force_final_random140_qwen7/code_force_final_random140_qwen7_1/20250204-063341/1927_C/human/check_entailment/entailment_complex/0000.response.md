Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m`, the value of `k`, and the elements of sets `a` and `b`.
3. It uses `frozenset` to store the elements of `a` and `b`, which ensures that there are no duplicates within each set.
4. The function then iterates through the numbers from 1 to `k` to count how many of these numbers are in both `a` and `b` (`leftOnes`), only in `a` (`aOnes`), or only in `b` (`bOnes`).
5. After counting, it ensures that the total number of unique elements from both sets that can be used to satisfy the condition is exactly `k // 2` for both sets.
6. The logic for adjusting `aOnes` and `bOnes` when there are common elements (`leftOnes`) is correct.
7. Finally, it prints 'yes' if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `k // 2`, otherwise it prints 'no'.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly `k // 2` elements from each set such that all numbers from 1 to `k` are included.

Correctness: **True**
