Output State: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 1, 2, or 3, `a` and `b` are frozensets containing integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is at least 1, `leftOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` must be 3.**

Explanation: The value of `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Since `bOnes` could initially be 0, 1, or 2, after adding 1, it can now be 1, 2, or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
