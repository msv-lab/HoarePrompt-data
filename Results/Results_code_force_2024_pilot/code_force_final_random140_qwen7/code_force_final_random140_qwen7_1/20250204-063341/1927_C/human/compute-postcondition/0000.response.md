Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for t in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is within the specified range. Since the loop starts with `t` being read from input, the initial value of `t` must be within this range for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) for the loop to execute.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
