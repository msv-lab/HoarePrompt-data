Postcondition: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `leftOnes`, which is between 0 and the number of elements in `a` and `b` combined, inclusive; `i` is equal to `leftOnes`; `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values; `newk` is `k // 2`.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases: if `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be set to `leftOnes`, and if the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is false, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` will still be set to `leftOnes`, with all other variables retaining their original values and `i` being equal to `leftOnes`.
