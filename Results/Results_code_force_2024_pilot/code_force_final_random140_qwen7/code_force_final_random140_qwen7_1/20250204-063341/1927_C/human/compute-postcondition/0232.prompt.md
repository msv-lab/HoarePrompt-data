Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    leftOnes = 0
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            leftOnes += 1
        elif i in a:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    i = 0
    while i < leftOnes:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `leftOnes` is equal to `k`, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k`, and either both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk` or at least one of them is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `aOnes` = 3, `bOnes` = 3, `i` = 3, and `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk` remain in their initial or previously determined states.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `leftOnes`, which is between 0 and the number of elements in `a` and `b` combined, inclusive; `i` is equal to `leftOnes`; `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values; `newk` is `k // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
