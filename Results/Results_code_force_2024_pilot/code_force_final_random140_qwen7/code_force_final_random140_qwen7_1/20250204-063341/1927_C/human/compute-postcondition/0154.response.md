Postcondition: **`aOnes` = 3, `bOnes` = 3, `i` = 3, and `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk` remain in their initial or previously determined states.**

This means that regardless of whether the condition `aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk` is true or false, the final values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be 3, `i` will be 3, and the other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`) will retain their initial or previously determined states.
