Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `leftOnes` is 0.**

In this case, the code simply initializes `aOnes` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
