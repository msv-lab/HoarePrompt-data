Output State: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers; `aOnes` is increased by 1 if it was less than `bOnes`, otherwise `bOnes` is increased by 1; `i` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions for `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain the same as the original postcondition, just with the additional increment applied based on their initial comparison.
