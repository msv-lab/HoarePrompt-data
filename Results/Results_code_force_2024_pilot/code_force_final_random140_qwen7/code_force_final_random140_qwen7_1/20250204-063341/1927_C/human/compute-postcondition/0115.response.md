Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` and `b` are frozensets containing integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is at least 1, `leftOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` must be 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` becomes 1. If `i` is only in `b`, `aOnes` remains unchanged. If `i` is not in either set, the loop or statement is broken.**
