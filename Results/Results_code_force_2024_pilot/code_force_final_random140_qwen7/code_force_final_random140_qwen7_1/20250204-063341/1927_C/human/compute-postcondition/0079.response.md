Output State: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `leftOnes` is equal to `k`, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k`, and `t` is the integer input received.**

Explanation: The code `a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a frozenset from these integers. This changes the value of `a` to a frozenset of integers from the new input, while the other variables remain unchanged.
