Postcondition: **`aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input, `b` is updated to a frozenset of integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` must be at least 1, `leftOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `i` is either in `b` or not in `a` or `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
