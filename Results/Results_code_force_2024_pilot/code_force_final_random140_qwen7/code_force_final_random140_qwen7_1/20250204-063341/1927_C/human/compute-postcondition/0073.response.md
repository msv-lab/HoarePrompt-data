Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `aOnes` is either 0 or 1.
   - `bOnes` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3.
   - `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input.
   - `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `leftOnes` must be equal to `k`.
   - `newk` is `k // 2`.
   - `i` is `k`.
   - Both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`.

2. **Given Values:**
   - `aOnes` is either 0 or 1.
   - `bOnes` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3.
   - `newk` is `k // 2`.
   - `i` is `k`.
   - `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('yes')`.

Given the print statement `print('yes')`, it will simply print the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
