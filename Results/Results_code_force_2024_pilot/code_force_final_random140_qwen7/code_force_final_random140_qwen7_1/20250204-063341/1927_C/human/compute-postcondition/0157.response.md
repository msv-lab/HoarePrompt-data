Output State: **`aOnes` is 3, `bOnes` is 3, `i` is 3, `t` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers entered by the user.**

The code `a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a frozenset from these integers. The values of the other variables (`aOnes`, `bOnes`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged.
