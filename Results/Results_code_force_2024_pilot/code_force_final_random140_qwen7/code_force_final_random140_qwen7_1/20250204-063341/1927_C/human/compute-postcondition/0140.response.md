Postcondition: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers, `a` and `b` are frozensets containing integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `leftOnes` must be greater than 1. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.**
