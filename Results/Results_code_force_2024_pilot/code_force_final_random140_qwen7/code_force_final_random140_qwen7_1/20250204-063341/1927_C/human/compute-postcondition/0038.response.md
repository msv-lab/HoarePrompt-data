Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 (possibly incremented by 1), `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `leftOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `k` must be at least 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is set to 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is not in `a`.**
