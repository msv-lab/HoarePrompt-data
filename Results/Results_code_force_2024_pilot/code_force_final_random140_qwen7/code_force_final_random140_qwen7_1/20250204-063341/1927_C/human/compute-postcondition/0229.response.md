Based on the initial state provided:

- `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `leftOnes`.
- `i` is equal to `leftOnes`.
- `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values.
- `newk` is `k // 2`.
- The condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is false.

The print statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

Since the print statement directly outputs the string 'no' regardless of the values of other variables, the output will be:

Output: **no**
