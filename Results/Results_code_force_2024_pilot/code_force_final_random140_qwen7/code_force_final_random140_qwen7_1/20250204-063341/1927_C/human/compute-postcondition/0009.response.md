Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state of the program right before the loop:

The `while` loop is defined as:
```python
while i <= k:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The current state right before the loop is:
- `aOnes` is 0
- `bOnes` is 0
- `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input
- `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers
- `leftOnes` is 0
- `newk` is `k // 2`
- `i` is 1

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition of the loop head, which is `i <= k`.

Currently, `i` is 1 and `newk` is `k // 2`. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= k` must be true.

Since `i` is already 1, the critical part is ensuring that `k` is at least 1. If `k` were 0 or negative, the loop would not execute even once because `i` is already 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` must be at least 1.

State: **`aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `leftOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1 and `k` must be at least 1**
