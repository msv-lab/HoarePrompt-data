Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 1 or 0, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `leftOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `i` is either in `a` or not in `a`, which determines the value of `aOnes`. Whether `i` is in `b` or not determines the value of `bOnes`.**
