Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `leftOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`**.

This means that the value of `k` is divided by 2 and stored in `newk`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
