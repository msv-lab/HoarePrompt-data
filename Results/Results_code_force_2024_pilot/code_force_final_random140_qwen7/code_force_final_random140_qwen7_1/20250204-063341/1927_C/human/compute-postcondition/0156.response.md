Output State: **`aOnes` is 3, `bOnes` is 3, `i` is 3, `t` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. Since the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k` are not specified, they are represented as "an input integer".
