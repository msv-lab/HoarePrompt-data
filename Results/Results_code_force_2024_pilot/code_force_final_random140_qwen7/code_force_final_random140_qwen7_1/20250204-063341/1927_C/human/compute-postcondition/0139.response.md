Output State: **`aOnes` is an integer, `bOnes` is an integer + 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets containing integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `leftOnes` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `bOnes += 1` increments the value of `bOnes` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
