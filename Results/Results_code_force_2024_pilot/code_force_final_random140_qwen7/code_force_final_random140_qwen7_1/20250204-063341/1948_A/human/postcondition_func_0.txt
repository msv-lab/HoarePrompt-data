The function accepts no parameters and returns a string `res`. If the input `n` is 1 or less, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and constructs a string `res` by repeating characters from 'A' to 'Z' based on the value of `n`. Specifically, if `n` is even, it repeats each character twice; if `n` is odd, it repeats each character twice except for the last character which is repeated once. After constructing `res`, it prints the string.
