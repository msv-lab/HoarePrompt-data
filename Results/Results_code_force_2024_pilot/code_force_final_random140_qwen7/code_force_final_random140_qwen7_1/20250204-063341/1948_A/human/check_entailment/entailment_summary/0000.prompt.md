Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Functions with Execution Summary:
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if n <= 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            i += 1
        print(res)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a string `res`. If the input `n` is 1 or less, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and constructs a string `res` by repeating characters from 'A' to 'Z' based on the value of `n`. Specifically, if `n` is even, it repeats each character twice; if `n` is odd, it repeats each character twice except for the last character which is repeated once. After constructing `res`, it prints the string.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls the `func_1()` function. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` must remain greater than 0.
