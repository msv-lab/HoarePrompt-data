Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a string with exactly `n` special characters where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
2. The provided solution correctly handles the logic for determining whether a suitable string can be constructed and prints the appropriate output.
3. In `func_1()`, the program checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it prints "NO" and returns. Otherwise, it prints "YES" and constructs a string `res` with the required properties.
4. The construction logic in `func_1()` ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters. It alternates between appending two of the same character and one of the same character, ensuring that each character is special.
5. In `func_2()`, the program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each. This ensures that the program processes multiple test cases as specified.
6. The provided example demonstrates that the program works correctly for the given input.

Given the above points, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
