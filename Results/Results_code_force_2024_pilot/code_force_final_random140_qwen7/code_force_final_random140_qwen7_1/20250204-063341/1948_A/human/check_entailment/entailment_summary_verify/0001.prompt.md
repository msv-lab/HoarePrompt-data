You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if n <= 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            i += 1
        print(res)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls the `func_1()` function. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` must remain greater than 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters.
   - The string must have exactly `n` special characters.
   - A character is considered special if it is different from exactly one of its neighbors.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function handles a single test case.
   - It takes an integer `n` as input.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and generates a string with `n` special characters.

3. **Generating the String:**
   - The function uses a loop to build the string.
   - It alternates between adding two identical characters and one unique character to ensure the special condition is met.
   - The loop continues until `n` special characters are added.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Testing the Functionality

#### Test Case 1: `n = 6`
- Expected Output: `YES\nAAABAACC`
- Explanation:
  - The string "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
  - The function correctly generates this string.

#### Test Case 2: `n = 1`
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Explanation:
  - It is impossible to have exactly 1 special character in a string.
  - The function correctly prints "NO".

#### Test Case 3: `n = 2`
- Expected Output: `YES\nMM`
- Explanation:
  - The string "MM" has 2 special characters (both 'M' are special since they have no neighbors).
  - The function correctly generates this string.

### Edge Cases
- **`n = 0`:**
  - The function should print "NO" because it is impossible to have 0 special characters.
  - The current implementation does not handle this case explicitly but will work correctly since `n <= 1` already covers this scenario.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a string with the required number of special characters for each test case. It handles all the given examples and edge cases appropriately.
