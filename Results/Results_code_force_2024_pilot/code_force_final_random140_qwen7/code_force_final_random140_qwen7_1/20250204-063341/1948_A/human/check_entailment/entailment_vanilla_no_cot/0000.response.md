Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
- The function `func_1()` attempts to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters, but it does not ensure that the generated string meets the criteria where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- For example, consider the input `n = 6`. The function generates "AAABAACC", which has 6 special characters, but it doesn't guarantee that all characters are special according to the definition.
- The function `func_1()` does not handle cases where generating a string with exactly `n` special characters is impossible, such as when `n` is odd and greater than 1. In such cases, it should print "NO".
- Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `n` is 1 correctly. It should print "YES" and a string like "A" instead of "NO".

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('YES')
        print('A')
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
        print('A' + 'B' * (n - 1) + 'A')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Your response:
Correctness: **True**
```

This corrected version ensures that the generated string meets the criteria and handles edge cases properly.
