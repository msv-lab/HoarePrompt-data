Reasoning:
- The problem requires generating a string with exactly `n` special characters where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- `func_1()` attempts to generate such a string but does not actually ensure that the generated string has exactly `n` special characters. Instead, it generates a simple alternating pattern of characters, which does not necessarily meet the problem's requirements.
- `func_2()` simply calls `func_1()` for each test case without any additional logic to handle the specific requirements of the problem.
- Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, `func_1()` fails to generate strings that have exactly `n` special characters for certain values of `n`.

Therefore, the given implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
