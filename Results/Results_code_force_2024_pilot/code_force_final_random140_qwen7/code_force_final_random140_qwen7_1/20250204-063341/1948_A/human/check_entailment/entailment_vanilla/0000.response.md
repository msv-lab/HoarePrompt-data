Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters.
   - The string must have exactly `n` special characters.
   - A character is considered special if it is different from exactly one of its neighbors.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function handles a single test case.
   - It takes an integer `n` as input.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and generates a string with `n` special characters.

3. **Generating the String:**
   - The function uses a loop to build the string.
   - It alternates between adding two identical characters and one unique character to ensure the special condition is met.
   - The loop continues until `n` special characters are added.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Testing the Functionality

#### Test Case 1: `n = 6`
- Expected Output: `YES\nAAABAACC`
- Explanation:
  - The string "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
  - The function correctly generates this string.

#### Test Case 2: `n = 1`
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Explanation:
  - It is impossible to have exactly 1 special character in a string.
  - The function correctly prints "NO".

#### Test Case 3: `n = 2`
- Expected Output: `YES\nMM`
- Explanation:
  - The string "MM" has 2 special characters (both 'M' are special since they have no neighbors).
  - The function correctly generates this string.

### Edge Cases
- **`n = 0`:**
  - The function should print "NO" because it is impossible to have 0 special characters.
  - The current implementation does not handle this case explicitly but will work correctly since `n <= 1` already covers this scenario.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a string with the required number of special characters for each test case. It handles all the given examples and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
