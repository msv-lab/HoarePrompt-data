Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet, `i` is 2, `ans` is a string consisting of the first two characters of `s`, repeated `int(input())` times, whether `int(input())` is odd or even, and if `n` is odd, `ans` is constructed as described; if `n` is even, `ans` is a string containing "ss" repeated `n` times, `x` is `n` divided by 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.
