Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: The state given is that `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since no other variables are mentioned or modified within the loop, we only need to ensure that `t` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
