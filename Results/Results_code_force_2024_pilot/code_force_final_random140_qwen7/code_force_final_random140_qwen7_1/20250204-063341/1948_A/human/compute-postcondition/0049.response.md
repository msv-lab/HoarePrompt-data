Output State: **`ans` is "ss", `x` is 0, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code appends `s[x] * 2` to `ans`. Given that `x` is 0 and `s` is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet, `s[0]` is 'A'. Therefore, `s[0] * 2` results in 'AA', which is appended to `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, after the operation, `ans` becomes "AA". However, the problem statement specifies that `ans += s[x] * 2`, and since `x` is 0, `s[0]` is 'A', so `ans` becomes "ss" (not "AA" due to the multiplication). The other variables remain unchanged.
