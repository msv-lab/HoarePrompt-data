Output: **ss...ss (where the number of "ss" is n/2)**

Explanation:
- `ans` is a string containing "ss" repeated `n` times.
- `x` is `n` divided by 2, so `x = n / 2`.
- `t` must be greater than 2, but this variable is not used in the `print(ans)` statement.
- `s` is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet, but it is not used in the `print(ans)` statement.
- `i` is 2, but it is not used in the `print(ans)` statement.
- `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, but it is not used in the `print(ans)` statement.

Therefore, the `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans`, which is "ss" repeated `n` times, but since `x = n / 2`, it will print "ss" repeated `n / 2` times.
