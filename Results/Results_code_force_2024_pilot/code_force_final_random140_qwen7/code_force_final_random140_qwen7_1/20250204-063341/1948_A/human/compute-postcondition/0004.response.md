Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (assuming `func_1()` does not modify `t`), the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
