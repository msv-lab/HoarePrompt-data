State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine the number of iterations.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, the smallest possible value for `t` is 1.
4. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

No other adjustments are necessary as the only variable involved in the loop head is `t`.
