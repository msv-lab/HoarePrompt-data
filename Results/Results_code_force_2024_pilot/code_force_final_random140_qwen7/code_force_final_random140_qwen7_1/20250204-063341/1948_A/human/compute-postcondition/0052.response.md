Output State: **`ans` is "sss", `x` is 1, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends twice the character at index `x` of string `s` to `ans`. Given that `x` is 1, `ans` was initially "ss", and `s` is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet, `ans` becomes "sss". The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
