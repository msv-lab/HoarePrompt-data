n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. tree is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree with n vertices, where each vertex is indexed from 0 to n-1. The add_edge method of the Tree class is used to add edges to the tree, and the root_tree_non_recursive method is used to root the tree at vertex 0.
