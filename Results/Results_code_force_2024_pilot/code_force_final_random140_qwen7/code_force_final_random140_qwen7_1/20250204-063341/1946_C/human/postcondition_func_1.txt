The function `dfs` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. `x` represents a vertex in the tree, and `y` represents the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing `k` edges. The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from vertex `x`. It calculates and returns a tuple containing two elements: `c`, which is the sum of all `ans` values when `ans` was less than `y`, and `r`, which is the sum of all `rn` values plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.
