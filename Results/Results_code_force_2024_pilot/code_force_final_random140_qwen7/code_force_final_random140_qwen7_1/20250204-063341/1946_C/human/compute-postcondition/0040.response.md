Postcondition: **`stack` is an empty list, `v` is 's', `postorder` is True, `good_components['s']` is the total count of good components from all children of 's', and `remaining_size['s']` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of 's' where `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`; if no such children exist, `remaining_size['s']` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of 's'.**
