Output State: **`postorder` is not an empty value, `stack` contains at least one tuple of the form `(u, False)` where `u` is a child of `tree.vertices[v]` except the last element which is now `(v, True)`, and the stack has appended `(v, True)` as a new element; `good_components[v]` is 0; `remaining_size[v]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `remaining_size[v]` to 1. This updates the value of `remaining_size[v]` from its previous unspecified value to 1. All other variables remain in their initial or previously described states.
