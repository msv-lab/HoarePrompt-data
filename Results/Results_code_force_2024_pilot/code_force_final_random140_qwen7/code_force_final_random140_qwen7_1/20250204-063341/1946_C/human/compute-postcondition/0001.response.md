Output State: **`visited` is a set containing 1, `ans` is the boolean value returned by `dfs(1, x)`, and `r` is the integer value returned by `dfs(1, x)`**.

Explanation: The code `ans, r = dfs(1, x)` calls the `dfs` function with the arguments `1` and `x`. The `dfs` function returns a tuple `(bool, int)`, which is unpacked into the variables `ans` and `r`. The `visited` set is updated to include the vertex `1` since the `dfs` function was called with this vertex. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
