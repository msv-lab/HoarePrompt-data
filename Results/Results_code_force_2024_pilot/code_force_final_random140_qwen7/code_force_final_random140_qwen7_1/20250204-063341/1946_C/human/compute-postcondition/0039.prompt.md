You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge in the tree, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: All elements in `edges` have been processed, and for each edge (a, b), both `g[a]` and `g[b]` include `b` and `a`.
    c = 0
    visited = set()
    l = 1
    r = n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and `mid` is the last value calculated before the loop exits.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the while condition `l <= r` will no longer be true because `l` will eventually become greater than `r`. At this point, the loop terminates. The variable `c` remains 0 and `visited` remains an empty set as they are not modified within the loop. The value of `mid` will be the last calculated value before the loop exits, which is determined by the latest values of `l` and `r`.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer n, an integer k, and a list of tuples representing edges in a tree, and does not specify what it returns.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
