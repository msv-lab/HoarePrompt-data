The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge in the tree, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.

After executing the function body, the function does not explicitly return a value in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of tuples representing edges in a tree, without specifying what it returns.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n, an integer k, and a list of tuples representing edges in a tree, and does not specify what it returns.**
