Postcondition: `good_components[v]' is increased by `good_components[u]' + 1 if `remaining_size[u]' is greater than or equal to `x'. Otherwise, `good_components[v]' is increased by `good_components[u]', `remaining_size[v]' is increased by `remaining_size[u]', and `good_components[u]' remains unchanged.
