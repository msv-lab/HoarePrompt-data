Postcondition: **`stack` is either a list containing alternating elements of vertices from `tree.vertices['s'].children` starting with `'s'` and ending with the deepest vertex, or an empty list. `v` is either the last vertex added to the `stack` which is the deepest vertex in the children hierarchy, or 's'. `postorder` is either False or True. `good_components['s']` is the total count of good components from all children of 's', and `remaining_size['s']` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of 's' where `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`; if no such children exist, `remaining_size['s']` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of 's'.**
