Output State: All children of `tree.vertices[v]` have been processed, meaning that for every child `u` of `v`, `good_components[v]` has been incremented by `good_components[u]` and, if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, by 1 as well. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]` has been updated to include the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v`. The `stack` will contain a single tuple `(v, True)` indicating that the processing of node `v` is complete. `postorder` will contain the values of all nodes processed, starting from the last added node and ending with `v`.

In more detail:
- `good_components[v]` reflects the cumulative `good_components` values of all direct children of `v`, plus an additional 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is at least `x`.
- `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v`.
- The `stack` will show that the processing of `v` is finished, indicated by `(v, True)`.
- `postorder` will list all nodes processed during the loop, with `v` being the last node in the list.
