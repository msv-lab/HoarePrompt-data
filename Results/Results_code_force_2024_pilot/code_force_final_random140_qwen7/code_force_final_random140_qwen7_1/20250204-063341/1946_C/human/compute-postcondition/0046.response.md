Output State: **`stack` is now ['(v, True)'], `v` is the first element of the last tuple in the original stack, and `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple in the original stack; `good_components[v]` is set to 0; `remaining_size[v]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code sets the value of `remaining_size[v]` to 1. The values of `stack`, `v`, `postorder`, and `good_components[v]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
