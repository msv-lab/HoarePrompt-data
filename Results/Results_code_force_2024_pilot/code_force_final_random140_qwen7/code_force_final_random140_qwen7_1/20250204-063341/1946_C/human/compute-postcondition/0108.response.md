Output State: **`good_components[v]' is increased by 1, `remaining_size[v]' is updated to be `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]', and `postorder' is updated with the value of `v'.**

This means that the value of `good_components[v]` has been incremented by 1, `remaining_size[v]` has been updated to its original value plus the value of `remaining_size[u]`, and `postorder` now contains the value of `v`. The initial conditions for `good_components[u]` and `remaining_size[u]` remain unchanged.
