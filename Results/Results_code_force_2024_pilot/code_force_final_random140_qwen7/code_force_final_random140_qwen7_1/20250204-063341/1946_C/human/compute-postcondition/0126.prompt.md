You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of a class representing a tree structure, where each vertex has a list of children. s is an integer representing the starting vertex in the tree, and x is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges.
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    good_components = {}
    remaining_size = {}
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            good_components[v] = 0
            remaining_size[v] = 1
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        elif postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                good_components[v] += good_components[u]
                if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                    good_components[v] += 1
                else:
                    remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]
        
    #State: Output State: `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True` for the initial vertex 's'. For every vertex `v` in the tree, `good_components[v]` contains the total count of good components including `v` and all its descendants. `remaining_size[v]` contains the sum of sizes of all children of `v` whose size is greater than or equal to `x`, or the sum of sizes of all children of `v` if no child meets the size condition.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all iterations, the stack is empty because all nodes have been processed. The `postorder` flag for the initial vertex 's' is set to `True`, indicating that the processing for 's' is complete. Each vertex `v` in the tree has its `good_components[v]` updated to reflect the total count of good components from `v` and all its descendants. Similarly, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to include the sizes of all children of `v` that meet the specified size condition.
    return good_components[s], remaining_size[s]
    #The program returns the tuple (good_components[s], remaining_size[s]), where `good_components[s]` is the total count of good components including the initial vertex 's' and all its descendants, and `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of sizes of all children of 's' that have a size greater than or equal to `x`, or the sum of sizes of all children of 's' if no child meets the size condition.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `tree`, which is an instance of a tree structure class; `s`, an integer representing the starting vertex; and `x`, an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. It returns a tuple containing two elements: `good_components[s]`, which is the total count of good components including the initial vertex 's' and all its descendants, and `remaining_size[s]`, which is the sum of sizes of all children of 's' that have a size greater than or equal to `x`, or the sum of sizes of all children of 's' if no child meets the size condition.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the tuple (good_components[s], remaining_size[s]), where `good_components[s]` is the total count of good components including the initial vertex 's' and all its descendants, and `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of sizes of all children of 's' that have a size greater than or equal to `x`, or the sum of sizes of all children of 's' if no child meets the size condition.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
