You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer, visited is a set initialized to be empty, and dfs is a function that takes the current vertex, the size threshold x, and returns a tuple (bool, int) where the bool indicates whether all connected components have at least x vertices and the int represents the number of edges removed so far.
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    ans, r = dfs(1, x)
    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: `visited` is a set containing 1, `ans` is a boolean value, `r` is an integer value. `ans` is less than `x` or `r` is less than `k`
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `x`, and returns True if all connected components in the graph have at least `x` vertices according to the dfs function. Otherwise, it returns False.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns True

Case_2: The program returns False


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
