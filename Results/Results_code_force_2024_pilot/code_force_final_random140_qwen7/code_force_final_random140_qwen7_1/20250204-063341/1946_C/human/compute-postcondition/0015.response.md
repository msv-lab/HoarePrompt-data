Postcondition: `r` and `c` are integers, `ans` is the result of the DFS function call with `node` and `y` as arguments, `rn` is the result of the DFS function call with `node` and `y` as arguments, `g[x]` must contain at least one element. If `node` is not in `visited`, then:
- If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, `r` is increased by `rn` plus 1.
- Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ans` and `r` remains unchanged.
