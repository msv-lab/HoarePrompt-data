The function `check` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. The function uses a depth-first search (dfs) function to determine if all connected components in a graph have at least `x` vertices. It also keeps track of the number of edges removed. Based on the outcome of the dfs function, the function either returns True or False.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x`, and returns True if all connected components in the graph have at least `x` vertices according to the dfs function. Otherwise, it returns False.**
