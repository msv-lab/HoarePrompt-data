Output State: All children of `tree.vertices[v]` have been processed, `stack` is empty, `good_components[v]` has been incremented for each child `u` by `good_components[u]` and an additional 1 if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size[v]` has been updated to include the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `tree.vertices[v]`. `postorder` contains all vertices from the traversal in the order they were visited.

This means that after the loop completes, `good_components[v]` will reflect the total count of good components including `v` itself and its descendants, considering the condition based on `remaining_size[u]`. The `remaining_size[v]` will hold the accumulated sizes of all children of `v`. The `stack` will be empty as all tuples related to `v` and its children will have been processed, and `postorder` will contain the traversal order of all vertices.
