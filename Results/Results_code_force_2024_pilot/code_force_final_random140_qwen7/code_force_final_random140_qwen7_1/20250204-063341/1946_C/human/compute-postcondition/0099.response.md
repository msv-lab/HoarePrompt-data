Output State: **`u` is the first child of `tree.vertices[v]`, `stack` contains at least one tuple of the form `(u, False)` where `u` is a child of `tree.vertices[v]` except the last element which is now `(v, True)`, and `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, and `postorder` is updated with the value of `v`**.

This means that the value of `good_components[v]` has been incremented by the value of `good_components[u]`. The other variables (`u`, `stack`, and `postorder`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
