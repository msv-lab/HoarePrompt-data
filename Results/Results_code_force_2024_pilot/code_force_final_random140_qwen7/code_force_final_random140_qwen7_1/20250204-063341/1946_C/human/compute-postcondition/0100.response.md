Postcondition: `u` is the first child of `tree.vertices[v]`, `stack` contains at least one tuple of the form `(u, False)` where `u` is a child of `tree.vertices[v]` except the last element which is now `(v, True)`, and `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, and `postorder` is updated with the value of `v`. Additionally, the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`.
