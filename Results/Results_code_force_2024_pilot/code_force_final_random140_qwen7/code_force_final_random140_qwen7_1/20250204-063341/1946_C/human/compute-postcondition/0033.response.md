Output State: **`r` is the sum of all `rn` values plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`, and `c` is the sum of all `ans` values when `ans` was less than `y`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `r` will be incremented by `1` for each time `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, and also by the value of `rn` (which is the result of the DFS function call). The variable `c` will be incremented by the value of `ans` for each time `ans` is less than `y`. All other variables such as `ans`, `rn`, `g[x]`, and the state of `visited` will remain in their final states after the last iteration of the loop.
