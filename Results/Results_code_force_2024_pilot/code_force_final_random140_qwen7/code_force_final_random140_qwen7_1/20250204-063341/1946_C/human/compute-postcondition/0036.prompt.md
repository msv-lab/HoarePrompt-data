You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, y is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. g is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, and visited is a set of visited vertices during the DFS traversal.
def dfs(x, y):
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: `r` is the sum of all `rn` values plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`, and `c` is the sum of all `ans` values when `ans` was less than `y`.
    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two elements: 'c', which is the sum of all 'ans' values when 'ans' was less than 'y', and 'r', which is the sum of all 'rn' values plus the number of times 'ans' was greater than or equal to 'y'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `x` and `y`. `x` is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, and `y` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The function returns a tuple containing two elements: 'c', which is the sum of all 'ans' values when 'ans' was less than 'y', and 'r', which is the sum of all 'rn' values plus the number of times 'ans' was greater than or equal to 'y'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing two elements: 'c', which is the sum of all 'ans' values when 'ans' was less than 'y', and 'r', which is the sum of all 'rn' values plus the number of times 'ans' was greater than or equal to 'y'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
