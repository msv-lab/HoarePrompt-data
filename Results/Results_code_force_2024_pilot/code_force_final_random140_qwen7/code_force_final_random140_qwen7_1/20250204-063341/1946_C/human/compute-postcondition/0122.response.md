Output State: The `stack` is empty, `postorder` is set to `True` for the current vertex being processed, `good_components` contains the total count of good components for each vertex in the tree, and `remaining_size` contains the sum of sizes of all children of each vertex that meet the condition of having a size greater than or equal to `x`.

In more detail:
- The `stack` is empty because all vertices have been processed.
- `postorder` is `True` for the current vertex, indicating that the postorder processing for that vertex has completed.
- `good_components` is updated to reflect the total count of good components for each vertex, considering all its descendants. A component is considered "good" if it meets certain conditions (which are not explicitly defined in the provided code but inferred from the context).
- `remaining_size` is updated to include the sum of sizes of all children of each vertex that have a size greater than or equal to `x`. If no children meet this condition, `remaining_size` for that vertex will be zero.
