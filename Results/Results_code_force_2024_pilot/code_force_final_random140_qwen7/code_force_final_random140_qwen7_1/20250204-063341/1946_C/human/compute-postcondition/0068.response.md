Output State: **`good_components[v]' is increased by 1, and `good_components[u]' remains unchanged, and `remaining_size[u]' remains unchanged`.**

Explanation: The code `good_components[v] += 1` increases the value of `good_components[v]` by 1. The values of `good_components[u]` and `remaining_size[u]` remain unchanged as per the initial state and the code does not affect them.
