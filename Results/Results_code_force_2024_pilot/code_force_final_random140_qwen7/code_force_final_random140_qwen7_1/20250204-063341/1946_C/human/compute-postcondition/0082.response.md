The loop condition is `while stack:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `stack` is not empty. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `stack` must contain at least one element.

Let's break down the current state and identify what needs to be adjusted:

- If `postorder` is an empty value, `stack` remains an empty list.
- Otherwise, `stack` contains tuples of the form `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `tree.vertices[v]`.
- For each node `v` in the tree, `good_components[v]` is increased by the sum of `good_components[u]` for each child `u` of `v`.
- If `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x` for any child `u`, then `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` for those children.

Since the loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty, we need to ensure that `stack` is non-empty for the next iteration. The simplest way to achieve this is to ensure that `stack` contains at least one tuple `(u, False)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `stack` is non-empty.

State: **`postorder` is not an empty value, and `stack` contains at least one tuple of the form `(u, False)` for some child `u` of `tree.vertices[v]`**
