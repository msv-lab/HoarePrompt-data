Postcondition: `r` is updated to either `r + 1` or `r + rn` depending on whether `ans >= y` is true or false. `c` is either unchanged or increased by `ans`. `ans` and `rn` are updated to the values returned by `dfs(node, y)`. `g[x]` must contain at least one element, and `node` is updated to the next element in `g[x]`.
