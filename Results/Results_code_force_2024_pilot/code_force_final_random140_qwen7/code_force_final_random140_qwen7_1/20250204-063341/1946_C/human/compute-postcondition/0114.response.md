Output State: **`good_components[v]'` is increased by 1; `remaining_size[v]'` is updated to be `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]'`. `postorder'` is updated with the value of `v`.**

Explanation: The code `good_components[v] += 1` increases the value of `good_components[v]` by 1. The values of `remaining_size[v]` and `remaining_size[u]` are added together to update `remaining_size[v]`. Additionally, `postorder` is updated with the value of `v`.
