Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 0
- `visited` is an empty set
- `l` is greater than or equal to `r`
- `mid` is the last value calculated before the loop exits

The code snippet in question is:
```python
print(r)
```

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the conditions and the loop behavior:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `l <= r`.
2. **Mid Calculation**: Inside the loop, `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
3. **Loop Termination**: The loop will terminate when `l > r`.

Given that `l` is initially greater than or equal to `r` and the loop continues until `l` becomes greater than `r`, the last value of `mid` calculated before the loop exits will be the value just before `l` exceeds `r`.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, we know that `r` will be the value just before the loop exits. Therefore, the value of `r` will be printed.

Output: **r**
