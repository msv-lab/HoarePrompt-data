Output State: **`good_components[v]'` is increased by `good_components[u]'`; `remaining_size[v]'` is updated to be `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]'`. `postorder'` is updated with the value of `v`; `remaining_size[v]'` is now `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]'**.

This means that the value of `remaining_size[v]` has been updated to include the value of `remaining_size[u]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `remaining_size[v]` which now holds the sum of its original value and `remaining_size[u]`.
