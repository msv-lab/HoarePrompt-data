Output State: **`r` and `c` are integers, `ans` and `rn` are the results of the DFS function call with the new `node` and `y` as arguments, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, and `node` is updated to the next element in `g[x]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans, rn = dfs(node, y)` calls the `dfs` function with `node` and `y` as arguments and assigns the returned values to `ans` and `rn`. The values of `r`, `c`, `g[x]`, and the condition about `g[x]` containing at least one element remain unchanged. Additionally, `node` is updated to the next element in `g[x]`.
