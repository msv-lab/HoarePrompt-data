Output State: **`r` is updated to `r + 1`, `c` remains unchanged, `ans` and `rn` remain unchanged, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, and `node` is updated to the next element in `g[x]`.**

The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The other variables (`c`, `ans`, `rn`, `g[x]`, and `node`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
