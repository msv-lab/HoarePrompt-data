Output State: `postorder` is not an empty value, `stack` contains multiple tuples of the form `(u, False)`, with each iteration appending a new `(u, False)` tuple to the stack, `good_components[v]` remains 0, `remaining_size[v]` remains 1.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `stack` will contain as many tuples of the form `(u, False)` as there are children of `tree.vertices[v]`. The `postorder` list remains unchanged, `good_components[v]` stays at 0 indicating no changes in the component status, and `remaining_size[v]` remains 1 suggesting that the size of the subtree rooted at `v` has not changed during the loop executions.
