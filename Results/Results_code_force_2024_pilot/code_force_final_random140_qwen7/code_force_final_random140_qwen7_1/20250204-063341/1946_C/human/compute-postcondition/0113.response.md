Output State: **`good_components[v]'` is increased by `good_components[u]'`; `remaining_size[v]'` is updated to be `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]'`. `postorder'` is updated with the value of `v`.**

Explanation: The code `good_components[v] += good_components[u]` increases the value of `good_components[v]` by the value of `good_components[u]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes the increase in `good_components[v]` and the addition to `remaining_size[v]`, while `postorder` is updated with `v`.
