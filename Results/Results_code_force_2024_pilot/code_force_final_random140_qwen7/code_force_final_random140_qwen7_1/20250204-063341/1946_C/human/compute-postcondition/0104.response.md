Output State: **`u` is the first child of `tree.vertices[v]`, `stack` contains at least one tuple of the form `(u, False)` where `u` is a child of `tree.vertices[v]` except the last element which is now `(v, True)`, and `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, and `postorder` is updated with the value of `v`, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to be `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]`, and `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`**.

This means that the value of `remaining_size[v]` has been updated to include the value of `remaining_size[u]`. All other conditions and states remain unchanged from the initial state.
