Output State: `postorder` is not an empty value, `stack` contains multiple tuples of the form `(u, False)`, with each iteration appending a new `(u, False)` tuple, `good_components[v]` is 0, `remaining_size[v]` is 1.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `postorder` remains non-empty. The `stack` will contain several tuples of the form `(u, False)`, with each tuple representing a child node of `tree.vertices[v]` that hasn't been fully processed yet. Each iteration of the loop appends a new `(u, False)` tuple to the stack, ensuring that all child nodes of `v` are eventually pushed onto the stack. `good_components[v]` remains 0, indicating no changes to the component status of vertex `v`. Similarly, `remaining_size[v]` remains 1, signifying that vertex `v` still has one remaining unprocessed child.
