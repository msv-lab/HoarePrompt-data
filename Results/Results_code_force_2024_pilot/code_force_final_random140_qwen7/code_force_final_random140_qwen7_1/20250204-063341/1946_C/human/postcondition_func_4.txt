The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from input, constructs a tree with \( n \) vertices based on additional input edges, roots the tree at vertex 0 using a non-recursive method, and then calls another function `func_4` with the tree, \( n \), and \( k \) as arguments, printing the result.
