The function accepts a tree represented as a collection of its edges (`tree`), the number of vertices in the tree (`n`), and the number of edges to be removed (`k`). It uses binary search to find a value for `beg`, which is either the midpoint value `mid` (if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true) or 1 (if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns false). The function returns `beg`, and sets `end` to -1. The value of `mid` is the result of the last calculation of `((beg + end + 1) // 2)`.
