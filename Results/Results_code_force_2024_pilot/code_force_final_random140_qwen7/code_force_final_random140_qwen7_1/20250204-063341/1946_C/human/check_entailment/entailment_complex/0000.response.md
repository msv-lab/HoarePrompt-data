Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - It then performs a binary search to find the maximum value `r` such that it is possible to remove `k` edges and ensure that each remaining connected component has at least `r` vertices.
   - The binary search is correctly implemented with the variables `l` and `r` being updated appropriately.
   - The function prints the result of the binary search, which should be the maximum value `r` found.

2. **Function `dfs`**:
   - This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the size of connected components and the number of edges removed.
   - It correctly updates the count of vertices in connected components (`c`) and the total number of edges removed (`r`).
   - The function returns a tuple containing the sum of sizes of components smaller than `y` and the total number of edges removed.

3. **Function `check`**:
   - This function uses DFS to verify if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It clears the `visited` set, starts the DFS from vertex 1, and checks if the conditions are met.
   - The function returns `True` if the conditions are satisfied, otherwise `False`.

Given the descriptions and the logic in the functions, the overall approach seems correct. The binary search in `func_1` is designed to find the maximum value `r` that satisfies the condition, and the `dfs` and `check` functions are used correctly to validate the condition.

Correctness: **True**
