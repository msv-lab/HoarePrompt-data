Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
q = []
for i in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    edges = []
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        edges.append((a, b))
    if i == 325:
        print(n, k, edges)
    func_1(n, k, edges)
for (n, k, edges) in q:
    func_1(n, k, edges)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    c = 0
    visited = set()


    l = 1
    r = n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of a tree. It then constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree. Next, it performs a binary search to find a specific value `r`, which is printed as the output. The function does not return any value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def dfs(x, y):
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            (ans, rn) = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
    return (c, r)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `dfs` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. `x` represents a vertex in the tree, and `y` represents the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing `k` edges. The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from vertex `x`. It calculates and returns a tuple containing two elements: `c`, which is the sum of all `ans` values when `ans` was less than `y`, and `r`, which is the sum of all `rn` values plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    (ans, r) = dfs(1, x)
    if ans >= x and r >= k:
        return True
    return False
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `check` accepts an integer `x` and returns a boolean value. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from vertex 1 to determine if all connected components in the graph have at least `x` vertices. If the DFS confirms this condition and the number of edges removed (`r`) meets a certain threshold (`k`), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
