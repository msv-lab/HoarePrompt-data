Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

Here's why the code is incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**: The binary search is initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`. However, the upper bound `r` should be `n` because the size of each connected component can be at most \( n \). This means the search space should be from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Check Function Logic**: The `check` function is supposed to verify if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices. However, the current implementation of `dfs` in `check` does not correctly count the number of connected components and their sizes after removing edges. Specifically, the `dfs` function returns the size of the largest connected component and the total number of nodes in that component, which does not help in verifying the condition for \( k \) edges removal.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function does not correctly handle the removal of edges and the counting of connected components. It only counts the size of the largest connected component and the total nodes in that component, which is not sufficient to determine if exactly \( k \) edges can be removed to meet the requirement.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
