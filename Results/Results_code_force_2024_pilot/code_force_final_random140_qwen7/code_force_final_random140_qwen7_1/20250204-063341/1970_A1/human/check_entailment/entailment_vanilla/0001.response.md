Let's reason through the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty list `positions` to store tuples of `(balance, index, character)`.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate` to get both the index and the character.
     - If the character is '(', it increments the `balance`.
     - If the character is ')', it decrements the `balance`.
     - It appends a tuple containing the current `balance`, the current index, and the character to the `positions` list.
   - After processing all characters, it sorts the `positions` list based on the `balance` (ascending order) and the index (descending order).
   - It constructs the resulting string by extracting the characters from the sorted `positions` list and joins them into a single string.
   - Finally, it returns the constructed string.

3. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the correctness of the implementation with the provided example:
     - Input: `(()(()))`
     - Expected Output: `()(()())`

   - **Processing the Input:**
     - For the input string `(()(()))`, the balances at each position are:
       ```
       Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1
       Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9
       Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )|
       ```

   - **Sorting the Positions:**
     - Sorting the positions based on balance (ascending) and index (descending):
       ```
       Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3
       Position| 1| 9| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
       Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )|
       ```

   - **Constructing the Result:**
     - The last row of the sorted table gives the characters in the shuffled order: `()(()())`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
