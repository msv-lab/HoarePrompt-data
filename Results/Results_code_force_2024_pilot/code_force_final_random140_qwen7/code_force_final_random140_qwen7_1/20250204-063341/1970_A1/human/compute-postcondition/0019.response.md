Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `s`, `balance` is the value of the third character of `s` plus 2 (since balance was initially calculated as the third character plus 1 and then incremented by 1), `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)`, `((value of balance calculation), 1, char)`, and a new tuple `(balance, 2, char)` is appended to `positions`.**

This means:
- `s` remains a non-empty string.
- `i` remains 2.
- `char` remains the third character of `s`.
- `balance` is now the value of the third character of `s` plus 2.
- `positions` now includes the original tuple `(1, 0, char)`, the tuple representing the initial balance calculation `((value of balance calculation), 1, char)`, and a new tuple `(balance, 2, char)` is added to the list.
