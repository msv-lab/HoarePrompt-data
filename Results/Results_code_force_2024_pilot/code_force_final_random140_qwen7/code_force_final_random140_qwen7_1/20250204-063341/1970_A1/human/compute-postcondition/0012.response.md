Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `char`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. This means `i` should be less than the length of `s`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `char` is the first character of `s`.
   - `balance` is 1 if `char` is '(', otherwise it is decreased by 1.
   - `positions` is a list containing a tuple `(balance, i, char)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - `char` will now be the second character of the string `s`.
   - `balance` will be updated based on the new `char`.

5. **Ensure the list `positions` is updated**: The list `positions` will contain the tuple `(balance, i, char)` for each character in the string `s`. After the first iteration, it contains `(1, 0, char)`. For the next iteration, it will contain `(1, 0, char)` and the new tuple `(balance, 1, char)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is 1.
- `char` is the second character of `s`.
- `balance` is updated based on the second character of `s`.
- `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)` and `(balance, 1, char)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `s`, `balance` is updated based on the second character of `s`, `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)` and `(balance, 1, char)`**.
