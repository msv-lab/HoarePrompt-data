Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `s`. `balance` is adjusted based on whether `char` is `(` or not: if `char` is `(`, `balance` is the value of the third character plus 2; otherwise, `balance` is the value of the third character minus 1. `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)`, `((value of balance calculation), 1, char)`, and a new tuple `(balance, 2, char)` is appended to `positions`.
