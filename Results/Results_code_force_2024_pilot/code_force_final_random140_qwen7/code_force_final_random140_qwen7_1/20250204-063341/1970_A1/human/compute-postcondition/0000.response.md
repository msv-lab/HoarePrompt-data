Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", and ")", its length is stored in `n`. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged.
