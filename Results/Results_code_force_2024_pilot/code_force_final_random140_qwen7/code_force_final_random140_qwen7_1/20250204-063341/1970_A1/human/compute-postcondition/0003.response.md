Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for (i, char) in enumerate(s):`. The objects involved here are `i`, `char`, and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `balance` is 0.
   - `positions` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` along with its index `i`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `s` must be a non-empty string because `enumerate` will generate pairs starting from index 0 if `s` is non-empty.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `s` is the string being enumerated, it must be a non-empty string for the loop to start.
   - `i` will start from 0 and increment with each iteration.
   - `char` will be the first character of `s` in the first iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `s` must be a non-empty string, `i` must be 0, and `char` must be the first character of `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `s`**
