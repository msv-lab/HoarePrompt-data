Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance` is 0; `positions` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `positions`. The values of `s`, `n`, and `balance` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `s` is still a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is still the length of `s`; and `balance` is still 0. The new variable `positions` is introduced as an empty list.
