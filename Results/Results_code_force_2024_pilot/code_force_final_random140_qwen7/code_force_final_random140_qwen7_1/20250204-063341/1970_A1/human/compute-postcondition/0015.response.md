Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `s`, `balance` is updated based on the second character of `s` (it is incremented by 1 if `char` is '(', otherwise decremented by 1), and `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)` and either `((value of the second character of s) + 1, 1, char)` or `((balance - 1), 1, char)` depending on whether `char` is '(' or not.
