Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `s`. Depending on whether `char` is `(` or not, `balance` is either the value of the third character of `s` plus 2 or the value of the third character minus 1. `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)`, `((value of balance calculation), 1, char)`, and a new tuple `(balance, 2, char)` or `(balance - 1, 2, char)` is appended to `positions`.
