Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `i` is equal to `n-1`; `char` is the last character of `s`; `balance` is 0; `positions` is a sorted list of tuples, each representing the balance, index, and character at each step of the loop, with the last tuple being `(0, n-1, char)`; `result` is the string formed by joining the characters in the `positions` list.**

Explanation: The code `result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])` creates a new string `result` by extracting the third element (character) from each tuple in the `positions` list and joining them together. The values of `s`, `i`, `char`, `balance`, and `positions` remain unchanged.
