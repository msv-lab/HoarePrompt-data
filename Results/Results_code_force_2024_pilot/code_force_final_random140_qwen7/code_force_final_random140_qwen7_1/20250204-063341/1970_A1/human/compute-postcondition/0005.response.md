Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `char` is '(', balance is 1**.

The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Given that `char` is specifically mentioned to be '(', and no other changes are made to `s`, `i`, or `char`, these variables retain their initial values. Therefore, `balance` is updated to 1.
