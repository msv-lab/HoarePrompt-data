Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))` creates a set from the string `encoded` to remove duplicate characters and then sorts the resulting set to create a list of unique characters in ascending order. The length of `encoded` remains unchanged, and the original string `encoded` is still a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
