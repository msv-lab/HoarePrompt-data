Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` sorted in ascending order; `r` is a string which is the concatenation of all characters in `unique_chars`; `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each character in `r` to the corresponding character from the end of `r`; `decoded` is a string obtained by replacing each character in `encoded` with the corresponding character from the end of `r` according to the `char_map`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new string `decoded` by replacing each character in `encoded` with the corresponding character from the end of the string `r` using the `char_map` dictionary. The original variables `unique_chars`, `r`, and `char_map` remain unchanged. The `decoded` string is constructed based on the mapping defined in `char_map`.
