Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The `func_1` function is designed to decode the string according to the problem statement.
   - It first extracts the unique characters from the `encoded` string and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - Then it creates a mapping (`char_map`) that pairs each character in `r` with its corresponding character from the end of `r`.
   - Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the `encoded` string by replacing each character with its symmetric counterpart from `r`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program should work correctly for the given problem constraints and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
