Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the decoding logic based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into parts, which is an efficient way to handle multiple test cases.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it correctly extracts the length `n` and the encoded string `encoded`.
3. **Constructing the Auxiliary String `r`**: It creates the string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string.
4. **Creating the Character Mapping**: It builds a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character from the end of `r`.
5. **Decoding the String**: Using the character mapping, it decodes the encoded string to get the original string `s`.

The logic and implementation match the problem requirements accurately, and the provided examples demonstrate that the program works correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
