Postcondition: **`cur` is either `M1 - 5` or `M1 - 4`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0] being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is greater than 2, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` if `i != L[cur] - 1` and `cur` is `M1 - 4`, or `ans` remains unchanged if `i == L[cur] - 1` and `cur` is `M1 - 5`.**
