Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: N (an integer representing the length of the permutation), M1 and M2 (integers representing the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums respectively), L (a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order), and R (a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order). The function returns 0 in three cases, and in the fourth case, it returns the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1).**
