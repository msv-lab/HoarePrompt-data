Postcondition: `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers representing the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums respectively, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0]` being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, `M1` is greater than 1, `M2` is less than or equal to 1, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
