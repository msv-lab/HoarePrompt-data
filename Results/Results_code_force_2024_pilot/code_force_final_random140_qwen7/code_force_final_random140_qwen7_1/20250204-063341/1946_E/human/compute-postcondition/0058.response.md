Output State: **`cur` is 3, `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`.**

Explanation: The variable `nums_left` is decremented by 1. Initially, `nums_left` was `N - R[0] - 2`. After decrementing, `nums_left` becomes `N - R[0] - 3`. The values of `cur`, `ans`, `i`, and `R[1] + 1` remain unchanged.
