Postcondition: **`cur` is `M1 - 2`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0]` being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and `L[-1] must be at least 2`. The current value of `i` is `L[-1] - 1` and the current value of `cur` is still `M1 - 2`, and the condition `i == L[cur]` is true.**
