Output State: **`cur` is 2, `i` is equal to `R[1]`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`cur`, `i`, `nums_left`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `cur` is 2, so `i` is initially equal to `R[cur-1]`, which is `R[1]`. After the code executes, `i` is increased by 1, but its exact new value is not specified without knowing the value of `R[1]`. The value of `nums_left` remains `N - R[0] - 2`, and `ans` remains the final computed value.
