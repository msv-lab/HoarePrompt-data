Output State: **`cur` is 3, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, and `i + 1 < N`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. Since `nums_left` is defined as `N - R[0] - 3`, the new value of `ans` becomes `ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD`. The other variables (`cur`, `i`, `nums_left`, and the condition `i + 1 < N`) remain unchanged.
