Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < N`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cur` is 3
   - `i` is increased by 1 (so `i` is now `i + 1`)
   - `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD`
   - `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`.
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of the current iteration, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the condition `i + 1 < N` must hold true for the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The states that need to be adjusted are those related to `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.
   - The other states (`cur`, `ans`, `nums_left`) do not affect the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

So, the new state should reflect that `i + 1 < N`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is 3, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, and `i + 1 < N`**
