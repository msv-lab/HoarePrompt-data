Output State: **`cur` is 2, `i` is equal to `R[cur-1]`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, and `ans` is the final computed value.**

Explanation: The line `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. Initially, `nums_left` was defined as `N - R[0] - 1`. After decrementing by 1, `nums_left` becomes `N - R[0] - 2`. The values of `cur`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
