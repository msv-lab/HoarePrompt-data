Output State: **The program returns the second return value of func_1(b, a) and the result of func_1(b, a)**

This means that the function `func_1(b, a)` was called with `b` as the first argument and `a` as the second argument. The function returned two values: `c` which is the result of the first return value, and `d` which is the second return value. The program returns both these values.
