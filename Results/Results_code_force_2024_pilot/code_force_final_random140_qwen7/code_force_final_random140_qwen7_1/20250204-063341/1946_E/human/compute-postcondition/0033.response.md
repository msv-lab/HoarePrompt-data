Output State: **`cur` is either `M1 - 5` or `M1 - 4`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0] being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` must be greater than 2, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` updated according to the condition `i == L[cur] - 1` or `i != L[cur] - 1`. If `i == L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 5`. If `i != L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 4` and `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` or `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` respectively.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is decremented by 1. Depending on its initial value (`M1 - 4` or `M1 - 3`), the new value of `cur` will be `M1 - 5` or `M1 - 4`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
