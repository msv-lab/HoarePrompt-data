You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

        #
        #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cur` will be `M1 - (N + 1)`, `i` will be 0, and `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - (N + 1)`. The variable `ans` will hold the final computed value after applying the loop's operations, starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and updating it based on the conditions inside the loop.
    #State: `cur` is `M1 - (N + 1)`, `i` is 0, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - (N + 1)`, and `ans` is the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and updating it based on the conditions inside the loop.

            i += 1
            
        #State: Output State: `cur` is `R.count(R[0]) + 1`, `i` is `N`, `nums_left` is `0`, and `ans` is the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
        #
        #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `N` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `N`. The variable `nums_left` starts as `N - R[0] - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0. Therefore, `nums_left` will be 0 after all iterations. The variable `cur` will be incremented each time `i` equals `R[cur]`, and it will stop incrementing once `i` reaches `N`. If `R[cur]` does not appear in `R` multiple times, `cur` will simply be `len(R)`. However, since we start with `cur` as 1 and increment it each time `i` matches `R[cur]`, and given the pattern described, `cur` will be `R.count(R[0]) + 1` after all iterations. Finally, `ans` will be the product of the remaining terms after each iteration, modulo `MOD`.
    #State: `cur` is `R.count(R[0]) + 1`, `i` is `N`, `nums_left` is `0`, and `ans` is the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: N (an integer representing the length of the permutation), M1 and M2 (integers representing the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums respectively), L (a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order), and R (a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order). The function returns 0 in three cases, and in the fourth case, it returns the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1).
