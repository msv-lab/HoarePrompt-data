Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to either `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD` (if `i != R[cur]`) or `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD` (if `i == R[cur]`), `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 4`, and `i + 1 < N`.**

Explanation: The line `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. Since `nums_left` was previously `N - R[0] - 3`, after executing the line, `nums_left` becomes `N - R[0] - 4`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged as per the initial postconditions.
