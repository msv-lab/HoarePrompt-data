Output State: **`cur` is `M1 - 4` or `M1 - 3`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0] being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is greater than 2, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the modulus with `MOD`. The values of `cur`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `nums_left`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for updating `cur` and `ans` based on the value of `i` relative to `L[cur] - 1` does not affect the current output state since the operation is already performed.
