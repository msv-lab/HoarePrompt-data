Output State: **`cur` is 1, `i` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, and `ans` is the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `cur = 1` changes the value of `cur` to 1. All other variables (`i`, `nums_left`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
