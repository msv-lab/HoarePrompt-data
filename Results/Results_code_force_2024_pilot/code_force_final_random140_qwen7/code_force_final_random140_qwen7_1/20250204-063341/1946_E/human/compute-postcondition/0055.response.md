Output State: **`cur` is 3, `i` is equal to `R[1] + 1`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, and `R[1]` must be less than `N - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given that `cur` was initially 2, after executing this line, `cur` becomes 3. The values of `i`, `nums_left`, and the condition involving `R[1]` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
