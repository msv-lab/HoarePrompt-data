### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the given problem. Let's break down the problem and the necessary steps to solve it correctly.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to count the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The key observation is that the intersection of prefix and suffix maximums gives us fixed points where the elements are uniquely determined.

2. **Steps to Solve the Problem**:
   - Identify the intersection of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - For each fixed point, the elements before and after are constrained but can be permuted freely within their respective ranges.
   - Calculate the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - For each segment between fixed points, calculate the number of permutations of the remaining elements.
   - Multiply these counts together to get the total number of valid permutations.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be very large, take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The original assessment correctly pointed out that the provided functions are irrelevant. However, the assessment did not provide a detailed solution or the correct approach to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are indeed not needed, but the assessment did not offer a correct alternative solution.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate in identifying that the provided functions are irrelevant. However, it did not provide a correct solution or approach to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is still considered **incorrect** because it does not provide a valid solution to the problem.

**Final: False**
