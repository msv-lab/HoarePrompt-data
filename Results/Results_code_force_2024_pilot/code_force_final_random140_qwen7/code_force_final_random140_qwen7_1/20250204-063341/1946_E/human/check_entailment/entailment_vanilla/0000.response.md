Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
   - The solution should output the count modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - A permutation has a unique prefix maximum at each position up to the last prefix maximum.
   - Similarly, a permutation has a unique suffix maximum at each position up to the last suffix maximum.
   - The intersection of these sets of positions will give us the fixed points where the prefix and suffix maximums overlap.

3. **Given Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) to compute the multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a`.
   - `func_2(a, b)`: This function uses `func_1` to compute `a` mod \(10^9 + 7\) efficiently.

4. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The EEA and modular multiplication functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) do not seem directly relevant to solving the permutation problem. They are typically used for modular arithmetic operations like finding inverses, which are not needed here.

5. **Solution Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to:
     - Identify the fixed points where both prefix and suffix maximums intersect.
     - Count the permutations that can be formed with the remaining elements.

6. **Algorithm**:
   - Find the intersection of the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The number of permutations is determined by the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements around these fixed points.

### Conclusion

The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the given problem. The problem requires combinatorial logic to count permutations based on given constraints, not modular arithmetic operations.

### Correctness

Given the analysis, the provided functions do not contribute to solving the problem correctly. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
