### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided functions to determine if they can be used to solve the problem correctly.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to count the number of permutations of length \( n \) that satisfy certain conditions regarding prefix and suffix maximums. Specifically, we need to ensure that the elements at the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are indeed the maximums in their respective prefixes and suffixes.

#### Provided Functions:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and their coefficients (Bezout coefficients).
   - The function takes two integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple `(c, d)` where `c` and `d` are the Bezout coefficients such that `c*a + d*b = gcd(a, b)`.
   - Given the problem context, this function does not seem to be directly related to solving the permutation problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calls `func_1` with `b` and a large prime number `1000000007`.
   - It then returns the product of the result `c` from `func_1` and `a`, modulo `1000000007`.
   - Again, this function does not seem to be directly related to solving the permutation problem.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the problem requirements, the provided functions do not address the necessary logic to determine the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is not relevant to this problem. Instead, we need to use combinatorial logic and dynamic programming to count the valid permutations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to solve the given problem and do not address the necessary logic required to count the permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

**Final: False**
