Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of permutations that match given prefix and suffix maximums. The solution involves calculating combinations using factorials and modular arithmetic.

2. **Factorial Precomputation**: The `facts` list is precomputed to store factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is used to calculate combinations efficiently.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The code checks if the first and last indices of the prefix and suffix maximums match the expected values (1 and `n` respectively).
   - If they do not match, it prints `0` because no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid permutations using combinations of elements between the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It iterates through the suffix maximums and calculates the number of ways to place elements between them using the `func_2` function.
   - Similarly, it iterates through the reversed prefix maximums and calculates the number of ways to place elements before them.
   - The results are combined to get the total number of valid permutations.

4. **Function `func_1`**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the extended Euclidean algorithm and returns the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. However, it is not directly used in the main logic of the program.

5. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it with `a` to compute the combination. This is correctly used in the main logic to calculate combinations.

Given the provided information and the execution summaries, the main logic appears to be correctly implemented to solve the problem. The use of factorials, modular arithmetic, and the combination calculations seem appropriate for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
