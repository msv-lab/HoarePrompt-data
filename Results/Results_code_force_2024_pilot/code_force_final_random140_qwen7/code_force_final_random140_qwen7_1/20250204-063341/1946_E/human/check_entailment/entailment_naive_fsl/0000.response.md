Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be directly related to solving the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The problem requires understanding the constraints and relationships between the prefix and suffix maximums to derive the number of possible permutations. However, the given functions appear to be implementing some form of extended Euclidean algorithm, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to analyze the given prefix and suffix maximums to determine the constraints on the positions of the maximum elements in the permutation. This involves ensuring that the maximums do not violate the conditions of being prefix or suffix maximums. The provided functions do not address these requirements and thus cannot be used to solve the problem as described.
