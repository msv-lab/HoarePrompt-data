### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution involves calculating combinations using the factorial precomputed in `facts` and modular arithmetic.

2. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - **facts Calculation:** The `facts` list is precomputed to store factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is used to efficiently compute combinations.
   - **Input Parsing:** The code correctly parses the input to get the length of the permutation (`n`), the number of prefix maximums (`m1`), the number of suffix maximums (`m2`), and the indices of these maximums.
   - **Edge Case Handling:** The code checks if the last index of prefix maximums matches the first index of suffix maximums, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations.
   - **Combination Calculation:**
     - For each suffix maximum, the code calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements between the current and previous suffix maximums using combinations.
     - Similarly, for each prefix maximum, the code calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements before the current prefix maximum.
   - **Modular Arithmetic:** All calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a`. It is used in `func_2` to compute the combination.
   - **func_2:** This function uses `func_1` to compute the combination of `a` choose `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for checking edge cases and the combination calculations seem correct.
   - The use of precomputed factorials and modular arithmetic ensures efficiency and correctness for large inputs.

### Conclusion:

The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It handles all necessary cases and performs the required calculations accurately.
