### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the given problem. However, the assessment did not fully evaluate the correctness of the main logic implemented in the annotated code. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The code initializes a list `facts` to store factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary for computing combinations later.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases, followed by the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Validation**:
   - The code checks if the last index of the prefix maximums matches the first index of the suffix maximums, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations exist.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - For each suffix maximum, the code calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the current suffix maximum and the next suffix maximum, using the `func_2` function.
   - Similarly, for each prefix maximum, the code calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the current prefix maximum and the previous prefix maximum.

5. **Combining Results**:
   - The results from the combination calculations are combined to get the total number of valid permutations.

### Detailed Evaluation

1. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   - The precomputation of factorials is correct and efficient, ensuring that factorial calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Validation**:
   - The validation checks are correct and ensure that the given indices form a valid permutation structure.

3. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The combination calculation using the `func_2` function is correct. The function `func_2` uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute modular inverses, which is necessary for calculating combinations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Combining Results**:
   - The combination results are correctly combined to get the total number of valid permutations.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the annotated code and the detailed evaluation, the logic implemented in the code is correct and follows the required steps to solve the problem. The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not directly relevant, but the overall logic and implementation are correct.

**Final: True**
