### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The code correctly parses the input and validates the conditions for prefix and suffix maximums. It checks if the last index of prefix maximums matches the first index of suffix maximums, and if the first index of prefix maximums is 1 and the last index of suffix maximums is \( n \). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, which is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - The code uses combinatorial calculations to determine the number of possible permutations. Specifically, it calculates combinations using the `func_2` function, which in turn calls `func_1` for modular multiplicative inverse calculation.
   - The logic for calculating combinations is correct and follows the standard combinatorial formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \).

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The code correctly handles large numbers using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow. This is done through the use of precomputed factorials and modular inverses.

4. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loops for iterating over the indices of prefix and suffix maximums are structured correctly and handle the necessary calculations for each segment of the permutation.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases appropriately, such as when there are no valid permutations (e.g., mismatched indices or invalid ranges).

Given the above points, the provided code appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.
