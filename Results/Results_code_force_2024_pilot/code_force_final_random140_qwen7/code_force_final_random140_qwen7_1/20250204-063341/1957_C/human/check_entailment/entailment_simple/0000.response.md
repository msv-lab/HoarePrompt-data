Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic for calculating the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after `k` moves have been made.
2. The main loop iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions of the board (`n`) and the number of moves already made (`k`).
3. For each move, the program checks if the move is a diagonal move (i.e., `a != b`). If it's not a diagonal move, it effectively reduces the number of available positions by 2 (one for the white rook and one for the black rook). If it is a diagonal move, it reduces the number of available positions by 1 (since only one position is taken).
4. After processing all moves, the program calls `func_1(n)` to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining board.
5. The `func_1` function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations efficiently. It stores intermediate results in the `dp` dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
6. The `helper` function recursively calculates the number of configurations for a given number of unoccupied rows and columns. It uses memoization to store previously computed values, ensuring that the computation is efficient even for large values of `n`.

Given the provided explanation and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
