### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- We have an \(n \times n\) chessboard.
- You and the computer take turns placing rooks.
- You start first, and each valid move you make is mirrored by the computer.
- The goal is to find the number of different final configurations possible after \(k\) moves, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Given Code:
- The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `helper`.
- `func_1` calls `helper` with some input `x`.
- `helper` is a recursive function that calculates a value based on the input `len`.

#### Function Summary:
- The `helper` function computes the number of valid configurations for a given number of unoccupied rows and columns (`len`).
- The base case is when `len` is 0, returning 1.
- For other cases, it uses a recurrence relation involving previous values in the `dp` dictionary.

#### Analysis:
1. **Base Case**: When `len` is 0, the function returns 1. This makes sense because there are no more rows or columns to place rooks, so there is exactly one configuration (no rooks).
2. **Recursive Case**: The function `helper(len)` calculates the number of configurations using a combination of configurations from the previous steps. Specifically:
   - `x1 = helper(len - 1)` considers the case where no new rook is placed.
   - `x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)` considers the case where a new rook is placed in one of the available positions, and the remaining positions are calculated recursively.
   - The final result is the sum of these two cases.

This approach is indeed a combinatorial method to count the number of valid configurations. The recurrence relation used in `helper` is designed to count the number of ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other, considering the constraints of the problem.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the solution, the provided code appears to be a correct implementation of the logic required to solve the problem. The `helper` function correctly handles the combinatorial counting and dynamic programming aspects necessary to determine the number of valid configurations.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment was **inaccurate**. The provided code correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem, and the function summaries support this conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
