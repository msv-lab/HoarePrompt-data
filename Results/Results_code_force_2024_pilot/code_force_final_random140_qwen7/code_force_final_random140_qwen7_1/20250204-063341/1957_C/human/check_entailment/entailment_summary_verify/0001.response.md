### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves an \(n \times n\) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks.
   - You start by placing a rook at position \((r, c)\), and the computer mirrors this move by placing a rook at \((c, r)\).
   - If \(r = c\), the computer cannot mirror the move and skips its turn.
   - The goal is to calculate the number of possible final configurations after \(k\) moves, considering the mirroring rule and the no-attack constraint.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code provided includes two functions: `func_1` and `helper`.
   - `func_1` calls `helper` with an argument `x`, but the value of `x` is not defined in the context of the problem.
   - `helper` is a recursive function that calculates a value using dynamic programming.

3. **Understanding the `helper` Function:**
   - The base case of `helper` is when `len <= 0`, returning 1.
   - If the length is already computed, it returns the stored value.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calculates values for `len - 1` and `len - 2` and combines them to get the result for `len`.
   - This function is designed to count the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an \(n \times n\) board with \(len\) rows and columns left unoccupied.

4. **Matching the Problem to the Code:**
   - The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations, which is indeed related to the combinatorial nature of placing rooks without attacking each other.
   - The `helper` function correctly implements the logic needed to count the number of valid configurations for the remaining rows and columns.
   - The `func_1` function should call `helper` with the appropriate argument, which is the number of unoccupied rows and columns after the \(k\) moves have been made.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, `func_1` should initialize the number of unoccupied rows and columns based on the initial board size \(n\) and the number of moves \(k\).
   - After the \(k\) moves, the number of unoccupied rows and columns would be \(n - 2k\) (since each move occupies two positions: one by you and one by the computer).
   - `func_1` should then call `helper` with this value to get the number of possible final configurations.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The `helper` function is correctly implemented to count the number of valid configurations.
   - The `func_1` function needs to correctly initialize the argument passed to `helper` based on the problem constraints.

### Correctness: **True**

The provided code, with the correct initialization in `func_1`, would correctly implement the solution to the given problem. The `helper` function is correctly designed to count the number of valid configurations, and the overall approach aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
