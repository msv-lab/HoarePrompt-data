The function `helper` accepts a parameter `len`, which is a positive integer representing the number of unoccupied rows and columns left on the chessboard after the k moves have been made.

- If `len` is 1, the function returns 1.
- If `len` is greater than 1, the function returns either the value stored in `dp` at the index equal to the current number of unoccupied rows and columns left on the chessboard, or a value `y` defined as `x1 + x2`, where `x1` is the value returned by `helper(len - 1)`, and `x2` is `2 * (len - 1)` times the value returned by `helper(len - 2)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `helper` is to accept a positive integer `len` and return either 1, a value from the `dp` array, or a computed value based on recursive calls to itself with `len - 1` and `len - 2`.
