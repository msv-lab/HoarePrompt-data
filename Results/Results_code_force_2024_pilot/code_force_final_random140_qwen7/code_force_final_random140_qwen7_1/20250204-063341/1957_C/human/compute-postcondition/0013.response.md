Functionality: **The function `helper` accepts a positive integer `len`, which represents the number of unoccupied rows and columns left on the chessboard after the k moves have been made. It returns either 1, a precomputed value stored in `dp` at the index equal to `len`, or a calculated value based on recursive calls to itself with decremented `len` values.**
