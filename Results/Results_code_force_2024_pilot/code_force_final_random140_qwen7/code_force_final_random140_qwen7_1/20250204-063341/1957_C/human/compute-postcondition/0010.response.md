Output State: **The program returns a value 'y', which is defined as x1 + x2, where x1 is the value returned by helper(len - 1), and x2 is 2 * (len - 1) * the value returned by helper(len - 2)**

This means the program returns a value 'y' that is calculated based on the results of two recursive calls to the helper function, with arguments len - 1 and len - 2 respectively, and the value of 'len' being a positive integer greater than 0.
