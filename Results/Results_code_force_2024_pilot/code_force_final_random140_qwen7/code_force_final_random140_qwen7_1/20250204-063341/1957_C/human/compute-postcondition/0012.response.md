The function `helper` accepts a parameter `len`, which is a positive integer representing the number of unoccupied rows and columns left on the chessboard after the k moves have been made. 

- If `len` is 1, the function returns 1.
- If `len` is greater than 1 and there is a precomputed value stored in `dp` at the index equal to `len`, the function returns that value.
- Otherwise, the function calculates a value 'y' as the sum of `x1` and `x2`, where `x1` is the result of calling `helper(len - 1)`, and `x2` is twice the product of `(len - 1)` and the result of calling `helper(len - 2)`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `helper` is to accept a positive integer `len` and return either 1, a precomputed value from `dp`, or a calculated value based on recursive calls to itself with decremented `len` values.
