Output State: **`len` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not in dp, `y` is `x1 + x2`, `x1` is the value returned by helper(len - 1), `x2` is 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2), `dp[len]` is `y`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `y` to `dp[len]`. The value of `y` is already defined as `x1 + x2`, where `x1` is the value returned by `helper(len - 1)` and `x2` is `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
