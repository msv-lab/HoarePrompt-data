Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic for determining the distance between points assumes that the first two points read are always part of the same side of the square, which is not necessarily true. The program should identify the pairs of points that form the diagonals of the square and then calculate the side length from there.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Calculate all pairwise distances
        distances = []
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                dist = math.sqrt((points[i][0] - points[j][0]) ** 2 + (points[i][1] - points[j][1]) ** 2)
                distances.append(dist)
        
        # Find the maximum distance, which should be the diagonal of the square
        max_distance = max(distances)
        side_length = max_distance / math.sqrt(2)
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(area)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version reads all four points, calculates all pairwise distances, identifies the maximum distance (which corresponds to the diagonal of the square), and then calculates the area using the relationship between the side length and the diagonal of a square.
