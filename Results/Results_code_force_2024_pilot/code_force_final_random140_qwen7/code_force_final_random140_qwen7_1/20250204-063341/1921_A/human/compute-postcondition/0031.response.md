Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `h` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `n` is (a - c)² + (b - d)², `x` is (a - e)² + (b - f)²**

Explanation: The code calculates `x` as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. Here, `e` and `f` are the first and second integers from the input split and converted to integers. The value of `x` is updated based on these new values, while the other variables remain unchanged.
