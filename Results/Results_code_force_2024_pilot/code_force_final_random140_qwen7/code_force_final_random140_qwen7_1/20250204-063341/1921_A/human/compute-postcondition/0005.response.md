Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, steps is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input, `d` is the second integer from the input, `e` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the first integer from the input, `g` is an integer from the input, `h` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `g` and `h`. The other variables (`t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `steps` remains 0, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f` are as initially described. The new variables `g` and `h` are assigned the values of the integers entered by the user.
