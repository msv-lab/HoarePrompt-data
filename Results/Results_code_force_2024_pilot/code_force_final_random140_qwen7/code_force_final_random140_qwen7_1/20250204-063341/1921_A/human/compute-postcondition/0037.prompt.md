You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)
        
        x = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be equal to the number of iterations executed, `steps` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` will hold the last set of input values provided by the user, `n` will be the minimum value between the last calculated `n` and `x`, and `x` will be the last calculated value of `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)` compared to the previous `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the given coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
