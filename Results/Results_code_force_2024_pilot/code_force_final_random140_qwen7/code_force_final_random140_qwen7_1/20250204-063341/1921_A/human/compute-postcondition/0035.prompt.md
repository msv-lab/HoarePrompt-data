Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input from the user.
Code of the loop:
for steps in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    e, f = map(int, input().split())
    g, h = map(int, input().split())
    n = (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)
    x = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
    if x > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input, `d` is the second integer from the input, `e` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the first integer from the input, `g` is an integer from the input, `h` is an integer from the input, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`, and if `x` is greater than `n`, the function does not change the values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x`. Otherwise, the function does not change the values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are input integers, `e` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the first integer from the input, `g` is an integer from the input, `h` is an integer from the input, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `a` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer, `c` is updated to an input integer, `d` is updated to an input integer, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. If `x > n`, then nothing specific changes. Otherwise, nothing specific changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 1, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `h` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `n` is (a - c)² + (b - d)², `x` is (a - e)² + (b - f)². If `x` is greater than `n`, then either `n` remains unchanged and `x` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged and `n` is updated accordingly.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
