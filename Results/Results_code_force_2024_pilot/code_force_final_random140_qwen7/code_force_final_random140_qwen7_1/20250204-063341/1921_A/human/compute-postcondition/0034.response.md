Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `h` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `n` is (a - c)² + (b - d)², `x` is (a - e)² + (b - f)². If `x` is greater than `n`, then either `n` remains unchanged and `x` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged and `n` is updated accordingly.**
