Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input, `d` is the second integer from the input, `e` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the first integer from the input, `g` is an integer from the input, `h` is an integer from the input, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`, and if `x` is greater than `n`, the function does not change the values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x`. Otherwise, the function does not change the values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x`.
