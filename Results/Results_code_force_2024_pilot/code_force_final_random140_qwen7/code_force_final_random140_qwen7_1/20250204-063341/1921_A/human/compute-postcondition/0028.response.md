Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer.**

The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them based on whitespace, and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to `e` and `f`. The other variables (`t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) remain unchanged.
