Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for steps in range(t)`. The only variable here is `steps`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `steps`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `steps` is 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `steps < t`. Since `steps` starts at 1, for the loop to execute again, `steps` must be incremented to 2, and `t` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state**: Given that `steps` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be incremented to 2 for the next iteration. Also, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `steps` is 2**
