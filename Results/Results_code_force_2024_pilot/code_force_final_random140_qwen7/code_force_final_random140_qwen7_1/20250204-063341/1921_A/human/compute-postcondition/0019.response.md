Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `e` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the first integer from the input, `g` is an integer from the input, `h` is an integer from the input, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`, `a` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer, `c` is updated to an input integer, `d` is updated to an input integer, `g` is an integer from the input, `h` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `g` and `h`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `n`, and `x` are still as they were before, and `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are updated to new input integers, while `g` and `h` are assigned the values of the next two integers from the input.
