Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `steps` is 0 (not used in the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c` is the first integer from the input.
- `d` is the second integer from the input.
- `e` is the second integer from the input (which is the same as `d`).
- `f` is the first integer from the input (which is the same as `c`).
- `g` and `h` are integers from the input (though they are not used in the calculation of `x`).
- `n` is calculated as \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\), where `c` is the first integer from the input and `d` is the second integer from the input.
- `x` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\), where `e` is the second integer from the input (same as `d`) and `f` is the first integer from the input (same as `c`).

Given these calculations, both `n` and `x` simplify to the same expression because `e` is `d` and `f` is `c`.

So, the value of `x` is \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\), which is the same as the value of `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output this value.

Output: **(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)**
