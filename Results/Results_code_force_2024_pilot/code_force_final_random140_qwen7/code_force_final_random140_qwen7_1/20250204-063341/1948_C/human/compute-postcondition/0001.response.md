Output State: **`j` is 0, `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n`, which is an integer. The values of `j` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `j` is still 0, and `t` is still within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
