Output State: **The current value of `i` plus one is less than `n`; either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is less than '<' or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is less than '<'; we break out of the loop or condition we were inside.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or conditional block it is placed in. In this case, it exits the loop or condition where the initial state was defined. The values of `n`, `i`, `a[i]`, and `b[i + 1]` or `b[i - 1]` remain unchanged, and the loop or condition is exited.
