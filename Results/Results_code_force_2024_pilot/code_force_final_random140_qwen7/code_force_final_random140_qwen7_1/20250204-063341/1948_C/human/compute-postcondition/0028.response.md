Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i + 1` is less than `n`.
- Either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is less than a character, or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is less than a character.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

The output does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, or `n`. It directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
