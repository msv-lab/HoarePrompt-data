Output State: The loop completes all its iterations without encountering any condition that breaks it out. Therefore, the final output is 'YES'.

In Natural Language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is 'YES', indicating that none of the conditions within the loop that would cause it to print 'NO' and break were met.
