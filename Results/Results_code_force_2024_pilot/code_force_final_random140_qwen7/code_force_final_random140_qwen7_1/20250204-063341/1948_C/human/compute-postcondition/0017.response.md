Output State: **`i` is an index such that `i + 3` is less than `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered by the `break` statement, the only information that changes is that we have exited the loop or conditional statement.
