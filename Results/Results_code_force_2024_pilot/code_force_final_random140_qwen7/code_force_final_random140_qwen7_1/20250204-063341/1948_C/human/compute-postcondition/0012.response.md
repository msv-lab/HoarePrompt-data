Output State: **`i` is an index such that `i + 1` is less than `n`, where `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the value of `i` or `n`. It simply exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no new assignments or changes to `i` or `n` are made, their conditions remain the same, and the only change is that we have exited the loop or conditional block.
