Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `i + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement where the conditions involving `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` or `b[i - 1]` were being checked. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify them.
