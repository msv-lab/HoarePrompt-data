Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is an index such that `i + 1` is less than `n`. This means that `i` is currently set to a value that satisfies this condition.
- The code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Since the code snippet only contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the value of `i` or any other variables, the output will be the same.

Output: **NO**
