Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial Information
- The loop completes all its iterations without encountering any condition that breaks it out.
- The final output is 'YES'.
- The loop is defined as:
  ```python
  for j in range(int(input())):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Understanding the Loop
- The loop runs for a number of iterations determined by the integer input provided by the user.
- Since the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, the input value must be such that the loop runs to completion.

### Analyzing the Loop Head
- The loop variable in this case is `j`.
- The loop starts with `j = 0` and increments `j` by 1 at each iteration until `j` reaches the value of the input minus 1 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to n-1).

### Final State
- Since the loop completes all its iterations, the final value of `j` must be equal to the input value minus 1.
- Let's denote the input value as `N`. Therefore, the final value of `j` is `N - 1`.

### State Adjustment
- The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the input value `N` determines the number of iterations.
- Since the loop completes all iterations, the input value `N` must be a positive integer, and `j` must be `N - 1`.

### Conclusion
Given that the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, the input value `N` must be such that the loop runs to completion. Therefore, the final state should reflect the fact that the loop has completed all its iterations.

### Final Answer
State: **`j` is N - 1, where N is the input value that was provided and is a positive integer**.

Since the exact value of `N` is not specified, we can represent it symbolically. If we assume the input value `N` is known or can be represented as a variable, the final state would be:

State: **`j` is N - 1**.
