Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i + 1 < n` and the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` do not hold true for any iteration. After all iterations, if the loop completes without breaking (i.e., no `print('NO')` was executed), the final value of `i` will be `n-2` because the loop increments `i` by 2 each time and stops when `i` reaches `n-1`. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: `i` is `n-2`, and the loop does not print 'NO'. The final output printed will be 'YES' if the loop completes without breaking.

This means the final output state is: `i` is `n-2`, and the final output is 'YES'.
