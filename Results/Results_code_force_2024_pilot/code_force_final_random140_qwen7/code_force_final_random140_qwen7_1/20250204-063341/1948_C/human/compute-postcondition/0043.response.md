To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions under which the loop can continue executing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range specified by `int(input())`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- The loop will either print 'NO' and terminate early if any condition `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` is met for any `i` in the range.
- Or it will print 'YES' if no such conditions are met for all valid `i` values.

Since the loop is controlled by `j` and the input `int(input())`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

### Determining the Next State:
- If the loop has not yet terminated, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`, so `j` must be less than `int(input())` for the loop to continue.

### Updated State:
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The number of iterations is still controlled by `int(input())`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and the number of iterations is controlled by `int(input())`**.

However, since the exact initial value of `j` is not provided, we can only say that `j` is incremented by 1. If we denote the previous value of `j` as `j_prev`, then the new value of `j` would be `j_prev + 1`.

Thus, the state can be summarized as:
State: **`j` is `j_prev + 1`, and the number of iterations is controlled by `int(input())`**.
