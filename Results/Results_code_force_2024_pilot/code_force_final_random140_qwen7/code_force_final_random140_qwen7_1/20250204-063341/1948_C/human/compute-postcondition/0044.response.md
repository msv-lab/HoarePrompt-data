Output State: **`j` is `j_prev + 1`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The variable `j` was previously defined as `j_prev + 1`, and this definition remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both the updated value of `n` and the unchanged relationship of `j`.
