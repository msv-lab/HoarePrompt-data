Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes t test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), followed by two lines of strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. It does not return any value directly but processes the input according to the specified rules for each test case.**
