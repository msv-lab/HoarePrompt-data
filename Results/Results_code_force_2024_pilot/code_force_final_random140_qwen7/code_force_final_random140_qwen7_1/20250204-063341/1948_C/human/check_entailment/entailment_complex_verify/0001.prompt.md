You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for j in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; the input consists of t test cases, each test case includes a line with a single integer n, followed by two lines containing strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'.
def func():
    for j in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop completes all its iterations without encountering any condition that breaks it out. Therefore, the final output is 'YES'.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the output state is 'YES', indicating that none of the conditions within the loop that would cause it to print 'NO' and break were met. The loop processes each odd index `i` from 1 to `n-2` (since `i` increments by 2 each time), checking the specified conditions. If none of these conditions are satisfied for any `i`, the loop prints 'YES' after completing all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer \( n \) (even and between 2 and \( 2 \times 10^5 \)) and two strings of length \( n \) consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. For each test case, it checks if there exists an odd index \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \) where the character at index \( i \) in the first string matches either the character at index \( i+1 \) or \( i-1 \) in the second string and both are '<'. If such a condition is found, it prints 'NO' and stops processing further. If no such condition is found after checking all possible indices, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the above logic.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining if a robot starting at (1, 1) can reach (2, n) by moving according to the arrows in a 2xN grid. The robot moves in two steps: first, it moves horizontally (left or right), and then it moves vertically (down) to follow the arrow.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The robot must move down from (1, i) to (2, i) when it encounters a `>` in the first row.
   - The robot must move up from (2, i) to (1, i) when it encounters a `<` in the second row.
   - If the robot encounters a `<` in the first row at an odd index `i`, it must move to (2, i+1) or (2, i-1) depending on the next arrow in the second row.
   - The program should check if such a path exists without getting stuck or moving out of bounds.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates through the grid cells from 1 to n with a step of 2 (i.e., only checking odd indices).
   - It checks if the robot can move down from (1, i) to (2, i) and then check the next arrow in the second row.
   - If it finds a situation where the robot cannot move correctly (e.g., both adjacent arrows are `<`), it prints 'NO' and breaks the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a situation, it prints 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program only checks every other column (odd indices). This means it might miss some critical transitions, especially if the grid configuration allows the robot to move correctly but the program does not account for it.
   - The additional constraints (n is even, no arrows point outside the grid) are not explicitly handled in the code, but they do not affect the correctness of this specific logic.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program logic does not fully cover all possible paths, particularly for even indices and the sequence of arrows. It only checks every other column, which may lead to missing valid paths.
   - The program does not handle the case where the robot can move through even indices correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution because it only checks every other column and misses potential valid paths. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness:
**False**
