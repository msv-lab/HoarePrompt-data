Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times.
   - Inside this loop, it reads an integer `s` which should be the length of the string `e`, but it actually reads the string `e` directly without storing `s`.

2. **Counting '+' and '-':**
   - The program initializes two counters `P` and `M` to zero.
   - It iterates through each character `q` in the string `e`.
   - If `q` is '+', it increments `P`.
   - If `q` is '-', it increments `M`.

3. **Calculating Penalty:**
   - After counting the number of '+' and '-', the program calculates the penalty as `abs(P - M)` and prints it.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays.
- The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- The optimal strategy is to split the array into subarrays of alternating signs to minimize the penalty.

### Issues with the Given Program:
1. **Incorrect Input Handling:**
   - The variable `s` is not used and is being read as the string itself. This means the program does not use the actual length of the string as intended.

2. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The penalty calculation `abs(P - M)` is not correct for the problem. The penalty should be calculated based on the optimal way to split the array, not just the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' and calculates a penalty based on their difference, which is not the correct approach.

### Correctness:
**False**
