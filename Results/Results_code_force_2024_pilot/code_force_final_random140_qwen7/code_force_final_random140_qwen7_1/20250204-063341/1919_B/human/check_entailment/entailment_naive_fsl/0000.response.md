Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and prints the absolute difference between these counts. However, the problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into non-empty subarrays.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
+-+-+-
```
The program would output `0` because it counts 3 '+' and 3 '-' characters, resulting in an absolute difference of 0. However, the optimal solution is to split the array into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `0 + 0 = 0`. But the program does not consider this optimal split.

Another example is:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The program would output `8` because it counts 7 '-' and 3 '+' characters, resulting in an absolute difference of 4. However, the optimal solution is to split the array into `([-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, which results in a penalty of `7 + 5 = 12`.

Therefore, the program does not handle the problem correctly and fails to find the minimum possible penalty for some inputs.
