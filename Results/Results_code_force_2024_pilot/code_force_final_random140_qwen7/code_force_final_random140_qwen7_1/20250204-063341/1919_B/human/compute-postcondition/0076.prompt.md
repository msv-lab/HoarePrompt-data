You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length n.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        
        e = input()
        
        P = 0
        
        M = 0
        
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        
        print(abs(P - M))
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `M` will be equal to the total number of '-' characters in the string `e`, and `P` will be equal to the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`. The variable `q` will be the last character in the string `e` (if the string is not empty), and `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations minus one, which is `int(input()) - 1`. The variable `s` will retain its initial value since it is not affected by the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `P` will contain the count of '+' characters, `M` will contain the count of '-' characters, `q` will be the last character of the string `e` (or an empty string if `e` is empty), `i` will be the total number of test cases minus one, and `s` will keep the value it had before the loop started.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three variables: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (a positive integer between 1 and 5000), and s (a string of length n consisting of '+' and '-' characters). It returns a specific value based on the conditions defined by these variables.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
