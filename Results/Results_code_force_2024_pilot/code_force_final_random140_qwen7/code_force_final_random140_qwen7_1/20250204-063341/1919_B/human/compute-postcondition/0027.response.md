Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a string input from the user, `P` is 0, `M` is 0.**

The code initializes a new variable `M` and sets it to 0. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `e`, `P`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
