Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for q in e:`. This means the variable `q` is being iterated over the elements of the list `e`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `e` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `q` is a string.
   - If `q` is equal to '+', then `P` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `q` is not equal to '+' and `M` is 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `q` is being assigned the next element from the list `e`, we need to ensure that `e` still has elements to iterate over.
   - If `q` was equal to '+', `P` would be 1, but since we are moving to the next iteration, `q` will now be the next element in `e`.
   - If `q` was not equal to '+', `M` would be 1, and again, moving to the next iteration means `q` will be the next element in `e`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `q` will be the next element in the list `e`.
   - If the next element in `e` is '+', then `P` will be 1.
   - Otherwise, `M` will be 1.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`q` is the next element in the list `e`, if `q` is equal to '+', then `P` is 1, otherwise `M` is 1**.
