Based on the initial state provided:

- `q` is the last character in the string `e`.
- `P` is the total count of '+' characters in `e`.
- `M` is the total count of '-' characters in `e`.

The expression `abs(P - M)` calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(abs(P - M))` statement will be the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string `e`.

Output: **abs(P - M) (where P is the count of '+' characters and M is the count of '-' characters in the string e)**
