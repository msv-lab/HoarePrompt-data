Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 0 or 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty input string (with the first character removed), `P` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `q` equals '+', `M` is 1, and `q` is the next character in the string `e`**.

The value of `M` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
