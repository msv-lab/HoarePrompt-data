Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `q` will be the last character in the string `e`, `P` will be the total count of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` will be the total count of '-' characters in `e`.**

This means that after the loop has executed as many times as there are characters in the string `e`, `P` will hold the total number of '+' characters encountered, and `M` will hold the total number of '-' characters encountered. The variable `q` will be the last character processed from the string `e`.
