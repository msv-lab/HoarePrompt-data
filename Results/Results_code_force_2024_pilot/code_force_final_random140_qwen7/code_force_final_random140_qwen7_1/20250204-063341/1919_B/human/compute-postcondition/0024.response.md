Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is an empty string, `P` is 0, `M` is 0, and `s` is assigned the value of `int(input())`**.

This means that the variable `s` has been updated to hold the integer value entered by the user, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
