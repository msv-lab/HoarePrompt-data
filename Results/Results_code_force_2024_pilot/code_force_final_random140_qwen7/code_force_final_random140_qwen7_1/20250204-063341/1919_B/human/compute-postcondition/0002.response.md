Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 0 (or 1), `s` is an input integer, `e` is the input string**.

Explanation: The code `e = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `e`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `i` remains either 0 or 1, and `s` remains an input integer. The new variable `e` is assigned the input string provided by the user.
