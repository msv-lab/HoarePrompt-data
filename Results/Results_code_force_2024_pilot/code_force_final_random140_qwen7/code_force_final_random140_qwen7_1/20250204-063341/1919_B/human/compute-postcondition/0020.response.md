Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 0 or 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is an empty string, `P` is the total number of '+' characters in the original string `e`, and `M` is the total number of '-' characters in the original string `e`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `e` will be an empty string since one character is processed in each iteration. The variables `P` and `M` will hold the counts of '+' and '-' characters, respectively, from the original string `e`.
