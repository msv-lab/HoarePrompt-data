Output State: **`e` is the newly input string, `q` is the last character in the string `e`, `P` is the total count of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the total count of '-' characters in `e`, `i` is equal to `int(input())`, `s` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `e = input()` takes a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `e`. The other variables (`q`, `P`, `M`, `i`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
