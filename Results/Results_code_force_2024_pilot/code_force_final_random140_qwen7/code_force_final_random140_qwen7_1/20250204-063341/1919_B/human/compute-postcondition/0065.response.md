Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `q` which iterates over each character in the string `e`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `e`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1. Otherwise, `M` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `q` is the next character in `e`, for the loop to continue, `e` must still be a non-empty string.
   - After processing the current character `q`, `q` will be the next character in `e`.
   - If `q` was '+', `P` remains 1. If `q` was not '+', `M` is increased by 1.

5. **Formulate the new state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must still be a non-empty string, and `q` will be the next character in `e`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e`**
