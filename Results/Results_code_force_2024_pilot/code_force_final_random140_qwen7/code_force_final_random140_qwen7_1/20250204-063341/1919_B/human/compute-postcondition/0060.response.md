Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `e` is a non-empty string.
- If `q` equals '+', then `P` is 1.
- Otherwise, if `q` is not '+', then `M` is 1.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `q` and `e`.
2. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to continue, `e` must still contain characters to iterate over.
3. **Update States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `e` is a non-empty string, it will still have characters to iterate over unless `e` becomes an empty string.
   - In the next iteration, `q` will be the next character in the string `e`.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration
- `e` remains a non-empty string (since it still has characters left to iterate over).
- `q` will be the next character in the string `e`.

### Conclusion
Given that `e` is a non-empty string and `q` will be the next character in the string `e`, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e`**.
