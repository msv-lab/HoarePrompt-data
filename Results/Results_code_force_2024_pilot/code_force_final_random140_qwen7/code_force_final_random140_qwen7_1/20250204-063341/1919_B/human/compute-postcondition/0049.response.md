Output State: **`q` is the last character in the string `e`, `P` is the total count of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the total count of '-' characters in `e`, `i` is equal to `int(input())`, `s` is an input integer.**

The code `s = int(input())` assigns the value of the input taken from the user to the variable `s`. The other variables (`q`, `P`, `M`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
