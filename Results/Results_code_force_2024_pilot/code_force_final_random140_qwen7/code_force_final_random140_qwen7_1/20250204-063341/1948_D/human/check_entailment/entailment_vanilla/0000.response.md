Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` and converts it into a list of characters.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not implemented. This function is intended to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring.

3. **Finding Tandem Repeat Substrings:**
   - In `func_1()`, the function iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats starting from the largest possible length (`n // 2`) down to 1.
   - For each possible length `j`, it checks every possible starting position `k` in the string.
   - It counts how many characters match the condition for being part of a tandem repeat (either both characters are the same or one of them is a question mark).
   - If `count` equals `j`, it means we have found a tandem repeat of length `j`, and the function prints `j * 2` and returns.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If no tandem repeat is found, the function returns 0.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incomplete Function:**
   - The function `func_1()` is not fully implemented. There is no logic to handle the replacement of question marks (`'?'`) with lowercase Latin letters to maximize the length of the tandem repeat.

2. **Logic for Replacing Question Marks:**
   - The current logic does not consider replacing question marks to form the longest possible tandem repeat. It simply checks for existing tandem repeats without modifying the string.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program should output the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring after replacing each question mark optimally. However, the current implementation does not perform this optimization.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: False**
