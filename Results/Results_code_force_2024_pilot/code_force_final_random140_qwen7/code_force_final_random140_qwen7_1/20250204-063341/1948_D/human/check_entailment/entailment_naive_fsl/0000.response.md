Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle the replacement of question marks (`?`) to form the longest possible tandem repeat.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called within the main loop. This means that the function is not actually being used to solve the problem.

2. **Logic for Tandem Repeat**: The current logic in `func_1` checks if the first half of the substring matches the second half, but it does not attempt to replace the question marks (`?`) to form the longest possible tandem repeat.

3. **Replacement Logic**: There is no mechanism to replace the question marks with appropriate characters to form the longest possible tandem repeat. The current logic only checks if the existing characters form a tandem repeat without considering replacements.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `"code?????s"`

The expected output is `10`, which means we should replace the question marks to form `"codexxxxxxs"`. However, the current implementation does not attempt to do this.

A correct approach would involve:
- Iterating through the string and replacing each question mark with a character that maximizes the tandem repeat length.
- Checking potential tandem repeats after each replacement and keeping track of the maximum length found.

Since the provided code does not handle the replacement of question marks to form the longest possible tandem repeat, it fails to meet the problem description requirements. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
