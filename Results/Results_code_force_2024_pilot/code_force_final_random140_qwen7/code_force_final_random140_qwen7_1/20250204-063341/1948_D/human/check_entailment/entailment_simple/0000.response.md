### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **String Processing**: The function `func_1()` iterates through possible lengths of tandem repeats in reverse order (from the largest possible length down to 2). For each possible length `j`, it checks all possible starting positions `k` of the first half of the tandem repeat.

3. **Tandem Repeat Check**:
   - If either of the characters at positions `k` and `k+j` is a question mark (`'?'`) or they are equal, it increments the `count`.
   - If both characters are not equal and not question marks, it resets `count` to 0.
   - If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2*j` has been found, and it prints `2*j` and returns immediately.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - If no tandem repeat is found during the loop, the function returns 0 at the end.

5. **Output Generation**:
   - The function should generate the correct output for each test case based on the logic described above.

### Analysis of the Given Code:

- The function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat.
- The nested loops iterate through all possible tandem repeat lengths and starting positions.
- The condition checking for tandem repeats is correctly implemented.
- The function returns the correct value (either the length of the tandem repeat or 0).

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the required functionality and produces the expected output based on the provided test cases.

### Correctness:

**True**
