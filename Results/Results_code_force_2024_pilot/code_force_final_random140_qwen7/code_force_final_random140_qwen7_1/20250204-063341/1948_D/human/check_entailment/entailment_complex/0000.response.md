Reasoning:

1. The provided program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the string `s` and calls the function `func_1()`.
3. The function `func_1()` aims to find the longest possible tandem repeat substring by replacing '?' with lowercase Latin letters.
4. However, the function implementation does not correctly handle the replacement of '?' characters and does not maximize the length of the tandem repeat substring.

Specifically:
- The function checks for valid tandem repeats but does not actually perform any replacements of '?' characters.
- The function uses a `count` variable to check if the current substring is a potential tandem repeat but does not update the string `s` to replace '?' with any specific character.
- The function returns immediately upon finding any valid tandem repeat without considering the possibility of maximizing the length further by replacing '?'.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
