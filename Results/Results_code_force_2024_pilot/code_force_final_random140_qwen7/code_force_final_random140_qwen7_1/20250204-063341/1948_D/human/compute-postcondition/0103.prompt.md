You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each testcase, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The total length of all strings s over all testcases does not exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, and no print statement was executed. Therefore, no output was generated.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It returns `j`, which is `n // 2 - 2`, if `n` is greater than or equal to 1; otherwise, it returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.

Case_2: The program does not return anything as there is no return statement in the given code.

Case_3: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.

Case_4: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.

Case_5: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.

Case_6: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.

Case_7: The program returns j, which is n // 2 - 2, given that n is greater than or equal to 1.

Case_8: The program returns None

Case_9: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.

Case_10: The program returns 0


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
