Postcondition: `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `count` is increased by 1 if the character at index `k` in `s` is either a '?', the character at index `k + j` in `s` is either a '?', or the character at index `k` in `s` is equal to the character at index `k + j` in `s`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged (specifically, it is 0).
