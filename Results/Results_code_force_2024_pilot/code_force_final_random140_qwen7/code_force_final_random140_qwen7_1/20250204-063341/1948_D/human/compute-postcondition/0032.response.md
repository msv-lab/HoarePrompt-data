Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n // 2 + 2`, and `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains 0, depending on whether `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]` evaluates to true. Since the if condition is `count == j`, and there is no return statement inside the if block, the `count` remains unchanged (either incremented by 1 or remains 0) as per the else part.**
