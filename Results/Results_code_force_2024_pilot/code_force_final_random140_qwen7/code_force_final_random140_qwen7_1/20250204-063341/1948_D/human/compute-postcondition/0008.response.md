Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2`, and `count` is either incremented by 1 if any of the conditions `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]` are met, or remains 0 if none of these conditions are met and `s[k]` is not equal to `'?'`, `s[k + j]` is not equal to `'?'`, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
