Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n // 2 + 2`, `count` is 0.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `count`. Since `count` was previously either 0 or incremented by 1 based on certain conditions, and now it is explicitly set to 0, the final value of `count` is 0. All other variables (`n`, `j`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
