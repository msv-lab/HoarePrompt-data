Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expressions `n // 2` and `0`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n // 2` down to `1`, decrementing by `1` each time.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The variable `j` will take values from `n // 2` down to `1`.
   - The value of `n` determines the starting point of the loop, which is `n // 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each testcase, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\).
- The total length of all strings `s` over all testcases does not exceed 5000.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `j` and `n`. The loop will start executing if `n // 2` is greater than `0`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `2` (since `n // 2` must be greater than `0`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), the total length of all strings `s` over all testcases does not exceed 5000, `n` must be at least 2, and `j` starts at `n // 2`.**

However, since we only need to specify the state of the objects in the loop head, we focus on `n` and `j`:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` starts at `n // 2`.**
