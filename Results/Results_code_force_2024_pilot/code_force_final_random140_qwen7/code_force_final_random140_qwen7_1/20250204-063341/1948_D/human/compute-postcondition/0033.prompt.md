Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be at least 2, `j` starts at `n // 2`, `count` is 0
Code of the loop:
for k in range(0, n - j):
    if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
        count += 1
    else:
        count = 0
    if count == j:
        print(count * 2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2`, and `count` is either incremented by 1 if any of the conditions `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]` are met, or remains 0 if none of these conditions are met and `s[k]` is not equal to `'?'`, `s[k + j]` is not equal to `'?'`, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n // 2 + 1`, and `count` remains unchanged (either 0 or incremented by 1 based on the conditions specified). Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j` after the if-else block executes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n // 2 + 2`, and `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains 0, depending on whether `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]` evaluates to true. Since the if condition is `count == j`, and there is no return statement inside the if block, the `count` remains unchanged (either incremented by 1 or remains 0) as per the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
