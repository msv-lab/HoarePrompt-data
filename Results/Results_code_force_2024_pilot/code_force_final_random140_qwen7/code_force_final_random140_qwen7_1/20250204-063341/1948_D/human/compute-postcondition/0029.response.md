Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is `n // 2`.
- `k` is `n // 2 + 2`.
- `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains 0, depending on the conditions involving `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`.

We need to determine the value of `count` to figure out what will be printed by `print(count * 2)`.

Let's break down the conditions for `count`:
- `count` is incremented by 1 if any of the following conditions are true:
  - `s[k] == '?'`
  - `s[k + j] == '?'`
  - `s[k] == s[k + j]`

However, without the actual string `s`, we cannot definitively determine the value of `count`. Therefore, `count` could be either 0 or 1.

Given this, the output of `print(count * 2)` will be:
- If `count` is 0, then `count * 2` is 0.
- If `count` is 1, then `count * 2` is 2.

Since we don't have the exact value of `count`, we express it in terms of the conditions described.

Output: **0 or 2 (depending on the conditions involving `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`)**
