Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n // 2 + 2`, and `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains 0, depending on whether `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]` evaluates to true. Since the if condition `count == j` is checked and there is no return statement in the if part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
