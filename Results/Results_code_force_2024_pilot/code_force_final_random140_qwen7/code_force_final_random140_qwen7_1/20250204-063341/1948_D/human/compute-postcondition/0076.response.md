Postcondition: **`j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `count` is either 0 or 1, `k` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the condition `(s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j])` is true or false.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `(s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j])` is true, then `count` will be 1 and `k` will remain 0. If the condition is false, then `count` will remain 0 and `k` will be incremented to 1.
