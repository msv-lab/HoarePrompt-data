To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `j` is `n // 2`.
   - `k` is `n // 2 + 1`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1 under certain conditions, otherwise it remains 0.

2. **Conditions for Incrementing `count`**:
   - If `s[k] == '?'`.
   - If `s[k + j] == '?'`.
   - If `s[k] == s[k + j]`.

3. **Condition for Not Incrementing `count`**:
   - `s[k]` is not equal to `'?'`.
   - `s[k + j]` is not equal to `'?'`.
   - `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.

4. **Final Condition**:
   - `count` is not equal to `j`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the possible scenarios for `count`:

- If any of the conditions for incrementing `count` are met, `count` will be incremented by 1.
- If none of the conditions for incrementing `count` are met, `count` will remain 0.
- Since `count` cannot be equal to `j`, if `count` is incremented, it must be 1 (because `j` is at least 1 since `n > 1`).

Therefore, `count` will either be 0 or 1. Given the final condition that `count` is not equal to `j`, and since `j` is at least 1, `count` must be 0 if none of the conditions for incrementing `count` are met.

Since the exact value of `count` is not specified in the initial state, we consider the most general case where `count` could be 0.

Finally, the expression `print(count * 2)` will print `count * 2`. If `count` is 0, then `count * 2` is also 0.

Output: **0**
