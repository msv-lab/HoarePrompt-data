Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotional conditions. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \). For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

2. **Base Case**: If the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the modified price \( b \), then it is not beneficial to use the promotion. Therefore, the profit is simply \( n \times a \).

3. **Promotion Case**: If the usual price \( a \) is less than the modified price \( b \), the program calculates the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price. The optimal \( k \) is determined by the condition \( k = b - a \) and constrained by \( k \leq n - 1 \). This ensures that the first \( k \) buns are sold at prices from \( b \) down to \( b - k + 1 \).

4. **Profit Calculation**: The total profit is calculated by summing the revenue from the first \( k \) buns and the remaining \( n - k \) buns. The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{profit} = n \times a + (b - a) \times (k + 1) - \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2}
   \]
   This accounts for the arithmetic series sum of the modified prices.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program correctly handles all the test cases and calculates the maximum profit accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
