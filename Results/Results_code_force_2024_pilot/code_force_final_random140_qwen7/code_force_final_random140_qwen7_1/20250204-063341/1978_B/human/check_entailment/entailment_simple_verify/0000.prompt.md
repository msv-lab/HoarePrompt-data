You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        n = x[0]
        a = x[1]
        b = x[2]
        profit = n * a
        if a >= b:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be `0`, as it starts from a positive integer value within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `profit` will reflect the final state after the last iteration of the loop. Specifically:
    #
    #- `x` will be a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces.
    #- `n` will be the first element of the list `x`.
    #- `a` will be the second element of the list `x`.
    #- `b` will be the third element of the list `x`, and it may have been updated during the loop if `a < b`.
    #- `profit` will be calculated based on the conditions given in the loop body. If `a >= b`, then `profit` will be `n * a`. Otherwise, `k` will be `min(n - 1, b - a)`, and `profit` will be `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.
    #
    #The exact values of `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `profit` depend on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns according to the given rules. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Base Case**: When `a` (usual price) is greater than or equal to `b` (modified price), the program correctly calculates the total profit as `n * a`. This is because selling all buns at the usual price would yield the highest profit in this scenario.

2. **Optimal Choice of `k`**: When `a` is less than `b`, the program calculates the optimal value of `k` as `b - a` and ensures that `k` does not exceed `n - 1`. It then calculates the profit using the formula `profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`. This formula accounts for the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is 0, the program correctly sets `k` to 0 and calculates the profit as `n * a`.
   - If `k` is equal to `n - 1`, the program correctly calculates the profit using the formula mentioned above.

Since the program handles all possible scenarios and edge cases correctly, it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
