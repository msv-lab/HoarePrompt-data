You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        n = x[0]
        a = x[1]
        b = x[2]
        profit = n * a
        if a >= b:
            print(profit)

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be `0`, as it starts from a positive integer value within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `profit` will reflect the final state after the last iteration of the loop. Specifically:
    #
    #- `x` will be a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces.
    #- `n` will be the first element of the list `x`.
    #- `a` will be the second element of the list `x`.
    #- `b` will be the third element of the list `x`, and it may have been updated during the loop if `a < b`.
    #- `profit` will be calculated based on the conditions given in the loop body. If `a >= b`, then `profit` will be `n * a`. Otherwise, `k` will be `min(n - 1, b - a)`, and `profit` will be `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.
    #
    #The exact values of `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `profit` depend on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculating Maximum Profit:**
   - The initial profit is set to `n * a`, assuming no buns are sold at the modified price.
   - If `a >= b`, it means there is no benefit in changing the price, so the profit remains `n * a`.
   - Otherwise, we need to calculate the optimal `k` and adjust the profit accordingly.

3. **Optimal `k`:**
   - The optimal `k` is determined by finding the point where the modified price starts to decrease the total profit.
   - The formula used is \( k = b - a \), which gives the difference between the usual price and the modified price.
   - However, `k` should not exceed `n-1` because Bob cannot sell more than `n-1` buns at the modified price.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit adjustment is calculated using the sum of the first `k+1` terms of an arithmetic sequence with the first term `(b - a + 1)` and the last term `b`.
   - This is represented by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{profit} = n \cdot a + (b - a) \cdot (k + 1) - \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - The term \(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\) is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `a >= b`, the profit does not change, and the program correctly prints `n * a`.
   - When `a < b`, the program correctly calculates the adjusted profit.

### Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 4 5`
  - Optimal `k` is `1` (since \( b - a = 5 - 4 = 1 \)).
  - Profit calculation: \( 4 \times 4 + (5 - 4) \times (1 + 1) - \frac{1 \times (1 + 1)}{2} = 16 + 2 - 1 = 17 \).

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `5 5 9`
  - Optimal `k` is `4` (since \( b - a = 9 - 5 = 4 \)).
  - Profit calculation: \( 5 \times 5 + (9 - 5) \times (4 + 1) - \frac{4 \times (4 + 1)}{2} = 25 + 20 - 10 = 35 \).

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `10 10 5`
  - Optimal `k` is `0` (since \( b - a = 5 - 10 = -5 \), which is invalid, so `k` is `0`).
  - Profit calculation: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `5 5 11`
  - Optimal `k` is `6` (since \( b - a = 11 - 5 = 6 \)), but `k` cannot exceed `n-1 = 4`, so `k` is `4`.
  - Profit calculation: \( 5 \times 5 + (11 - 5) \times (4 + 1) - \frac{4 \times (4 + 1)}{2} = 25 + 30 - 10 = 45 \).

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
  - Optimal `k` is `0` (since \( b - a = 0 \)).
  - Profit calculation: \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000 \).

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
  - Optimal `k` is `999999999` (since \( b - a = 999999999 \)).
  - Profit calculation: \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 + 999999999 \times 1000000000 - \frac{999999999 \times 1000000000}{2} \approx 1000000000000000000 \).

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `1000 1 1000`
  - Optimal `k` is `999` (since \( b - a = 999 \)).
  - Profit calculation: \( 1000 \times 1 + 999 \times 1000 - \frac{999 \times 1000}{2} = 1000 + 999000 - 499500 = 500500 \).

All the calculations match the expected outputs.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit and handles all edge cases appropriately.
