You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        n = x[0]
        
        a = x[1]
        
        b = x[2]
        
        profit = n * a
        
        if a >= b:
            print(profit)
        else:
            k = b - a
            k = min(n - 1, k)
            profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
            print(int(profit))
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be `0`, as it starts from a positive integer value within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `profit` will reflect the final state after the last iteration of the loop. Specifically:
    #
    #- `x` will be a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces.
    #- `n` will be the first element of the list `x`.
    #- `a` will be the second element of the list `x`.
    #- `b` will be the third element of the list `x`, and it may have been updated during the loop if `a < b`.
    #- `profit` will be calculated based on the conditions given in the loop body. If `a >= b`, then `profit` will be `n * a`. Otherwise, `k` will be `min(n - 1, b - a)`, and `profit` will be `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.
    #
    #The exact values of `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `profit` depend on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, a, and b, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and for each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function returns a result based on the relationship between these variables.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
