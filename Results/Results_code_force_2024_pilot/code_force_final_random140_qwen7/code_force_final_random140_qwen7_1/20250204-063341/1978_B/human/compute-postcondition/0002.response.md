Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input string from the user, splits it into a list of substrings using spaces as delimiters, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state as an input integer within the specified range.
