The code `x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input string, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. This changes the value of `x` from a list of strings to a list of integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces
- `n` is the first element of the list `x`
- `a` is the second element of the list `x`
- `b` is the third element of the list `x`
- `b` is now equal to the third element of the list `x` (This part is redundant since `b` is already defined as the third element)
- `profit` is `n * a` if `a >= b`. Otherwise, `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`

After executing the code, the value of `x` is updated to a list of integers. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are taken from the first, second, and third elements of this new list `x`, respectively. The value of `profit` is recalculated based on the updated values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers, `n` is the first element of `x`, `a` is the second element of `x`, `b` is the third element of `x`, and `profit` is calculated based on the conditions given.**
