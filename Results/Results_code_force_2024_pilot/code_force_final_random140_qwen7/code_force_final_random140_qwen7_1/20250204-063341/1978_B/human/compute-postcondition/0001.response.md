Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Determine the current state**: The state right before the loop is given as `t` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero (i.e., `t != 0`).

Given that `t` is already stated to be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is guaranteed to be non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary.

**Conclusion**: Since `t` is already a positive integer, it satisfies the condition `t` for the loop to execute the first time.

**Answer**:
State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
