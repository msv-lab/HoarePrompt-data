Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `n` is the first element of the list `x`; `a` is the second element of the list `x`; `b` is the third element of the list `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the third element of the list `x` to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` now holds the value of `x[2]`.
