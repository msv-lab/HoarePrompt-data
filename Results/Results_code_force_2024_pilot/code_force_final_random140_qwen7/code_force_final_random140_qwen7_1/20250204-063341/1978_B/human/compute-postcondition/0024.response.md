Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `x` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `k` is `b - a`, `profit` is `n * a`**.

In this output state, the value of `k` is updated to `b - a`. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
