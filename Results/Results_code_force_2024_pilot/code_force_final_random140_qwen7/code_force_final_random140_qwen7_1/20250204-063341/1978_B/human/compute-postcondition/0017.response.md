The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is truthy (i.e., non-zero). At the end of the previous iteration, `t` has been decremented by 1 (`t` is `t - 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`. Specifically, `t` must be set to a non-zero value.

State: **`t` must be non-zero, `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, and `profit` is calculated based on the conditions given.**
