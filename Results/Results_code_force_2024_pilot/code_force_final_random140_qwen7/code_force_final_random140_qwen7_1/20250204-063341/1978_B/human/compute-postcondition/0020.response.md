Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `x` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, and `a` is now equal to the second element of the list `x`.**

This means that the variable `a` has been updated to the value of the second element in the list `x`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
