Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `x` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `profit` by adding `(b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2` to its current value. Here, `k` is defined as `min(n - 1, b - a)`. Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are already defined from the initial state, `k` is calculated based on their values. The value of `t`, `x`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged from the initial state. The new value of `profit` is the sum of its original value and the expression involving `b - a`, `k`, and `k + 1`.
