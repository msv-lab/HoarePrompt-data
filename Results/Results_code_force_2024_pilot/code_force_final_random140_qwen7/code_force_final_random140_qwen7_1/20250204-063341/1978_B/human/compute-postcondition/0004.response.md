Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `n` is the first element of the list `x`; `a` is the second element of the list `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the second element of the list `x` to the variable `a`. The first element of the list `x` is still assigned to `n`, and `t` remains unchanged.
