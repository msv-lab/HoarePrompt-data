Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `n` is the first element of the list `x`; `a` is the second element of the list `x`; `b` is the third element of the list `x`; `profit` is as follows: if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `profit` is `n * a`. Otherwise, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2`, where `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)` and `a` is less than `b`.**
