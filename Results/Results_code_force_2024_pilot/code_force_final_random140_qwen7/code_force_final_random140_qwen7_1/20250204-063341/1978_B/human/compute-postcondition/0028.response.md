Postcondition: **`t` must be non-zero, `x` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `b` is now equal to the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is `n * a` if `a >= b`. Otherwise, `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.**
