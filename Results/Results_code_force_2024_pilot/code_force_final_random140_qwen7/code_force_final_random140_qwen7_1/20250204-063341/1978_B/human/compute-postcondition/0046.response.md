Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, a, and b, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and for each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function returns a result based on the relationship between these variables.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over t test cases, processing n, a, and b for each case to determine the output. However, since the specific logic is not provided, the description focuses on the input parameters and their ranges.
