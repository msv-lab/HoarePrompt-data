Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers, `n` is the first element of `x`, `a` is the first element of `x`, `b` is the original third element of `x` which is now reassigned to `x[2]`, `profit` is either `n * a` if `a >= b`, or `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2` where `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and the original `k` which is `b - a` if `a < b`.
