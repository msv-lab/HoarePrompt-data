Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `n` is the first element of the list `x`; `a` is the second element of the list `x`; `b` is the third element of the list `x`; `profit` is `n * a`. The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to the current value of `b`.**
