Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is `n * a`, `k` is `b - a`, and `a` is less than `b`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `k` as `b - a`. Since `a` is less than `b`, `k` will be a positive integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
