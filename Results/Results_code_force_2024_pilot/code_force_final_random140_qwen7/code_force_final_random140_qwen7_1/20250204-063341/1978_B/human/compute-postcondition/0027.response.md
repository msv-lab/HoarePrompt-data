Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be non-zero (though `t` is not used in the code).
   - `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting a string on spaces.
   - `n` is the first element of the list `x`.
   - `a` is the second element of the list `x`.
   - `b` is the third element of the list `x`.
   - `k` is calculated as `min(n - 1, b - a)`.
   - `profit` is calculated as `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.

2. **Calculation of `k`:**
   - `k = min(n - 1, b - a)`
   - This means `k` takes the minimum value between `n - 1` and `b - a`.

3. **Calculation of `profit`:**
   - `profit = n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`
   - Here, `n * a` is the contribution of `n` units at price `a`.
   - `(b - a) * (k + 1)` is the contribution of the range from `a` to `b` over `k + 1` units.
   - `- k * (k + 1) / 2` subtracts the triangular number sequence up to `k`.

Given this, let's assume a specific example to illustrate the calculation:

Suppose the input string is `"5 3 7"`, then:
- `x = ["5", "3", "7"]`
- `n = 5`
- `a = 3`
- `b = 7`

Now, calculate `k`:
- `k = min(5 - 1, 7 - 3) = min(4, 4) = 4`

Next, calculate `profit`:
- `profit = 5 * 3 + (7 - 3) * (4 + 1) - 4 * (4 + 1) / 2`
- `profit = 15 + 4 * 5 - 4 * 5 / 2`
- `profit = 15 + 20 - 10`
- `profit = 25`

Therefore, the output of the `print(int(profit))` statement will be the integer value of `profit`.

Output: **25**
