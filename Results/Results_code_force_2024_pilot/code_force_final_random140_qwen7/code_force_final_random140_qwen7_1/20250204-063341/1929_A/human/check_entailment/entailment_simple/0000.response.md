Reasoning:
The given program aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Loop through each test case**: The program uses a loop to process each test case, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Sort the array**: For each test case, the program reads the size `n` and the array elements. It then sorts the array `ar`.
3. **Calculate the beauty**: The program calculates the beauty of the array using the sorted elements. Since the array is sorted, the maximum difference between consecutive elements is achieved by placing the smallest element next to the largest element, and so on. This ensures the maximum possible sum of differences.

Let's analyze the logic:
- Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest values are placed next to each other, maximizing the difference.
- The sum of differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\) is maximized when the array is sorted because the largest and smallest values contribute the most to the sum.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
