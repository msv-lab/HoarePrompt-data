You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `t` being a new positive integer input by the user after the last iteration. For each iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, converted from a space-separated string of integers. After all iterations, the final value of `t` will be the input provided for the last iteration, and the corresponding `ar` will be the sorted list of integers for the last input `n`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the value it was set to on the last iteration, `n` will be the last input integer, and `ar` will be the sorted list of integers from the last input, all based on the inputs provided during the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list. The function then prints this sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final value of \( t \), which is the number of test cases processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in how the array is sorted and the calculation of the beauty. Sorting the array will not necessarily maximize the beauty; instead, we need to strategically place the largest and smallest values to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
4
3 4 3 3
```
The program sorts the array `[3, 4, 3, 3]` to `[3, 3, 3, 4]` and calculates the beauty as `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1`. However, the optimal arrangement would be `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`, which gives a beauty of `(4-3) + (3-3) + (3-3) = 1` or `(3-4) + (3-3) + (3-3) = -1`, but since we are looking for the maximum beauty, the correct beauty is `1`.

To fix this, we should place the largest value at the beginning and the smallest value at the end, and sort the rest of the array accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort()
        max_beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
        # Adjust for the first and last elements
        max_beauty = max(max_beauty, ar[-1] - ar[0])
        print(max_beauty)


func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum difference between the first and last elements is considered, which is necessary to achieve the maximum beauty.
