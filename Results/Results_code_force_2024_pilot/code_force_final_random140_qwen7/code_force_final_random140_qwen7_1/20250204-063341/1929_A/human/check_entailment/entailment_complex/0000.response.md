Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually. It reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array elements for each test case.

2. **Sorting the Array**: For each test case, the program sorts the array \( a \). Sorting ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which is crucial for calculating the maximum beauty of the array.

3. **Calculating Beauty**: After sorting, the program calculates the beauty of the array as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is done using the expression `sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)])`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case and finally outputs the value of \( t \), which is the number of test cases processed.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the program correctly follows the steps to calculate the maximum beauty of the array for each test case and handles multiple test cases as specified.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
