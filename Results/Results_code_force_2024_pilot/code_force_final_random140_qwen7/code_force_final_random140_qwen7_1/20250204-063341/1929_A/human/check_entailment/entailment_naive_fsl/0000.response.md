Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in how the array is sorted and the calculation of the beauty. Sorting the array will not necessarily maximize the beauty; instead, we need to strategically place the largest and smallest values to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
4
3 4 3 3
```
The program sorts the array `[3, 4, 3, 3]` to `[3, 3, 3, 4]` and calculates the beauty as `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1`. However, the optimal arrangement would be `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`, which gives a beauty of `(4-3) + (3-3) + (3-3) = 1` or `(3-4) + (3-3) + (3-3) = -1`, but since we are looking for the maximum beauty, the correct beauty is `1`.

To fix this, we should place the largest value at the beginning and the smallest value at the end, and sort the rest of the array accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort()
        max_beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
        # Adjust for the first and last elements
        max_beauty = max(max_beauty, ar[-1] - ar[0])
        print(max_beauty)


func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum difference between the first and last elements is considered, which is necessary to achieve the maximum beauty.
