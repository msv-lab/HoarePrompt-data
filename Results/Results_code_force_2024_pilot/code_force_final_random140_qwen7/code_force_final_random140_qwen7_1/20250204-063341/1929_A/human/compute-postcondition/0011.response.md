Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a new positive integer input by the user.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user and converted from a space-separated string of integers.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression inside the `sum()` function calculates the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `ar` from index 1 to `n-1`.
   - Specifically, it computes `(ar[1] - ar[0])`, `(ar[2] - ar[1])`, ..., `(ar[n-1] - ar[n-2])`.
   - These differences are then summed up.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `ar` is a sorted list of integers, the differences between consecutive elements represent the increments between these integers.
   - The sum of these differences gives the total increment from the first element to the last element in the sublist from index 1 to `n-1`.

Given this, the output will be the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sublist of `ar` from index 1 to `n-1`.

Output: **sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sublist of `ar` from index 1 to `n-1`**
