Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, and `n` is an integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `ar`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
