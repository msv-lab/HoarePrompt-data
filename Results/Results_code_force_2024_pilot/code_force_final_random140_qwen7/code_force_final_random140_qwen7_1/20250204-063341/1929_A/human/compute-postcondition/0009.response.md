Output State: **`t` is a new positive integer input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user converted from a space-separated string of integers, `n` is an input integer from the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `t` and `ar` remain unchanged.
