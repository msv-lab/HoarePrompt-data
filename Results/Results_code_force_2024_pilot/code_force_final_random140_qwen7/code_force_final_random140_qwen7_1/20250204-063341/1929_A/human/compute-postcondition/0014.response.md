Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and for each test case, n is an integer between 2 and 100, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n each between 1 and 10^9. The function returns different outputs based on the input data.**

This means the function does not take any parameters when called but expects input data in a specific format (t, followed by multiple lines of data) and processes this data to produce some output, which could vary depending on the input values.
