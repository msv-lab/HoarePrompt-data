Output: **sum of differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar` (where `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user)**

Explanation:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, but this value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer, representing the length of the list `ar`.
- `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.

The expression inside the print statement calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar`. Specifically, it computes the differences `(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` and then sums these differences.

For example, if `ar = [1, 3, 6, 10]`, the differences would be `[3-1, 6-3, 10-6] = [2, 3, 4]`, and the sum would be `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`.

Thus, the print statement outputs the sum of these differences.
