Output State: **`t` is a new positive integer input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user converted from a space-separated string of integers.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))` takes an input from the user (a space-separated string of integers), converts each element to an integer, sorts the list of integers, and assigns the sorted list to `ar`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
