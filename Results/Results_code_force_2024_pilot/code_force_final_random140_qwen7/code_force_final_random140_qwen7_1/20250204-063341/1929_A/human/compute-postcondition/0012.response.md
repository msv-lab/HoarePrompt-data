Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `t` is a new positive integer input by the user after the last iteration, `n` is an input integer for the last iteration, and `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user and converted from a space-separated string of integers for the last iteration.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, we have received multiple inputs of `t`, `n`, and lists of integers `ar` for each test case, but the final values of `t`, `n`, and `ar` correspond to the last test case processed by the loop.
