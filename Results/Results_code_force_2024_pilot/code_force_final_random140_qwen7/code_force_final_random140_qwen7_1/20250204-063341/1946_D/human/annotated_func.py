#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_new` processes a list of non-negative integers (`cur_arr`) based on the current bit position (`bit`). It iterates through `cur_arr`, performing bitwise operations to construct a new list (`new_arr`) that contains intermediate results. Depending on the value of the current bit, it either returns the length of the original list (`cur_arr`), the maximum value between the length of `new_arr` and the result of a recursive call to `find_new` with the next lower bit, or the result of another recursive call with the next lower bit. If no valid condition is met, it returns -1.
