Output State: **`new_arr` will contain all values of `xor` that were appended during each iteration where `xor` had the bit at position `bit` set to 0; `cur_arr` will be empty; `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`.**

Explanation: The code `thing1 = len(new_arr)` calculates the length of the list `new_arr` and assigns it to the variable `thing1`. The values of `new_arr` and `cur_arr` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `new_arr` still contains all values of `xor` that were appended during each iteration where `xor` had the bit at position `bit` set to 0, and `cur_arr` remains empty. The variable `thing1` now holds the length of `new_arr`.
