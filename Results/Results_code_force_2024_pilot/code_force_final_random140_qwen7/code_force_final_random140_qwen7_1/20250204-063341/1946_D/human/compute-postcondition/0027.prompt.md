Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: xor is 0, cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing the current array segment being processed, bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), and bit is not equal to -1; new_arr is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in cur_arr:
    xor ^= i
    if not xor >> bit & 1:
        new_arr.append(xor)
        xor = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `xor` is `xor` ^ `i`, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor` if `xor` is 0 when shifted right by `bit` and bitwise ANDed with 1 is 0. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `xor` is `xor ^ i`, `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` remains unchanged, and `cur_arr` is unchanged if `xor >> bit & 1` is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `xor` is updated to `xor ^ i`, `cur_arr` remains unchanged, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` has `xor` appended to it if `xor` does not have the bit at position `bit` set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
