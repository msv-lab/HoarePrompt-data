Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the length of new_arr (thing1) and the result of find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)**

This means the program will compare the length of the list `new_arr` (which contains all values of `xor` where the bit at position `bit` was set to 0 during each iteration) with the result of calling the function `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`. It then returns the larger of these two values.
