Output State: **xor is 0, cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing the current array segment being processed, bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), and bit is not equal to -1; new_arr is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `xor` is initialized to 0. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
