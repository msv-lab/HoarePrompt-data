Output State: **`xor` is `xor` ^ `i`, `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor` if `xor` is 0 when shifted right by `bit` and bitwise ANDed with 1 is 0. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains unchanged. `xor` is updated to `xor ^ i`.**

Explanation: The code `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
