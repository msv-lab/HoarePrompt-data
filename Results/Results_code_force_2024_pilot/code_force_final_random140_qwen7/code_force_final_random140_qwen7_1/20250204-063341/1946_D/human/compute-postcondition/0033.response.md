Postcondition: `xor` will be the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`, `new_arr` will contain all values of `xor` that were appended during each iteration where `xor` did not have the bit at position `bit` set to 1, `cur_arr` will be empty, and either the bit at position `bit` of `xor` is now set to 0 (if the condition `xor >> bit & 1` is true) or `new_arr` will contain all values of `xor` that were appended during each iteration where `xor` had the bit at position `bit` set to 0, and `thing1` is the length of `new_arr` (if the condition `xor >> bit & 1` is false).
