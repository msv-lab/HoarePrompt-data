Output State: **`xor` is `xor` ^ `i`, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `xor ^= i` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the element `i` from `cur_arr`. The result of this operation is stored back in `xor`. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, and `new_arr`) remain unchanged.
