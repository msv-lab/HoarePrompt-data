Postcondition: `xor` will be the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`, `new_arr` will contain all values of `xor` that were appended during each iteration, `cur_arr` will be empty, and either the bit at position `bit` of `xor` is now set to 0 (if `xor >> bit & 1` is true) or `thing1` is the length of `new_arr` (if `xor >> bit & 1` is false).
