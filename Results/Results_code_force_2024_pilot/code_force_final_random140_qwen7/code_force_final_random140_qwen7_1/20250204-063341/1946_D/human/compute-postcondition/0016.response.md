Output State: **`xor` is `xor` ^ `i`, `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` now contains the value of `xor` if `xor` is 0 when shifted right by `bit` and bitwise ANDed with 1 is 0, otherwise `new_arr` remains unchanged, `xor` is updated to `xor ^ i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `xor` to `new_arr`. The value of `xor` is updated to `xor ^ i` as per the initial state. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
