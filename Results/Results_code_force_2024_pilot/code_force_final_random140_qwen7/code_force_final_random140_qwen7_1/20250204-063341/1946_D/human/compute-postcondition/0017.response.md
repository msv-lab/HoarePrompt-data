Output State: **`xor` is 0, `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` remains unchanged, `cur_arr` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code sets `xor` to 0. This changes the value of `xor`. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
