Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `cur_arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in `cur_arr`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`xor`**: The postcondition mentions that `xor` is updated as `xor` ^ `i` during each iteration. However, the loop itself does not directly modify `xor`; it is modified within the loop body. Therefore, `xor` remains unchanged at the start of the next iteration.
   - **`cur_arr`**: The loop iterates over each element in `cur_arr`. Since the loop continues as long as `cur_arr` contains at least one element, `cur_arr` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - **`bit`**: The variable `bit` is not involved in the loop itself but is part of the overall state. It is not modified by the loop and remains the same.
   - **`new_arr`**: The state of `new_arr` is determined by the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine how `new_arr` changes. However, the condition for `new_arr` is based on the value of `xor` after all iterations, not just the start of the loop.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `cur_arr`.

- **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one of the elements in `cur_arr`. For the loop to continue, `i` will be the next element in `cur_arr`.
- **`cur_arr`**: It must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next element in `cur_arr`, and `cur_arr` still contains at least one element.

**State: **`xor` is `xor` ^ `i`, `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor` if `xor` is 0 when shifted right by `bit` and bitwise ANDed with 1 is 0. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains unchanged.**
