Output State: **`xor` will be the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`, `new_arr` will contain all values of `xor` that were appended during each iteration where `xor` did not have the bit at position `bit` set to 1, `cur_arr` will be empty, and the bit at position `bit` of `xor` is now set to 0, `thing1` is -1.**

Explanation: The code sets `thing1` to -1, which does not affect the values of `xor`, `new_arr`, `cur_arr`, or the bit at position `bit` of `xor`. The only change is that `thing1` is now explicitly set to -1.
