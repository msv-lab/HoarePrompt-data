Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing the current array segment being processed, bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), and bit is not equal to -1; new_arr is an empty list.**

The code initializes a new list `new_arr` without affecting the values of `cur_arr` or `bit`. Therefore, the initial conditions for `cur_arr` and `bit` remain unchanged, and `new_arr` is set to an empty list.
