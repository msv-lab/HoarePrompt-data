Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in cur_arr:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `cur_arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `xor` is 0.
   - `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
   - `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, and `bit` is not equal to -1.
   - `new_arr` is an empty list.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element. If `cur_arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `cur_arr` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `cur_arr` is not empty.
   - The other variables (`xor`, `bit`, and `new_arr`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute as long as `cur_arr` contains at least one element.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `cur_arr` must contain at least one element.

So, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`xor` is 0, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list**.
