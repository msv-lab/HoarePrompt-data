Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is used in the loop to iterate over elements in `cur_arr`.
   - `cur_arr`: This is the list from which `i` is taken.
   - `bit`: This is the integer representing the current bit position being considered.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop continues as long as `cur_arr` contains at least one element and `bit` is not equal to -1.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was an element from `cur_arr`. For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element from `cur_arr`.
   - **`cur_arr`**: Since `i` is taken from `cur_arr`, and assuming the loop body does not modify `cur_arr`, `cur_arr` should still contain at least one element for the next iteration. However, since `i` is removed from `cur_arr` in each iteration, `cur_arr` will have one less element.
   - **`bit`**: The value of `bit` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body. Given no modification is mentioned, `bit` stays the same.

4. **Postconditions and Adjustments:**
   - The postcondition for the loop is that `xor` is updated by `xor ^ i` in each iteration.
   - `new_arr` is determined based on the value of `xor` after shifting right by `bit` and performing a bitwise AND with 1. Since this operation does not depend on the loop counter `i`, `new_arr` remains unchanged.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be the next element from `cur_arr`.
- `cur_arr` will have one less element.
- `bit` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `xor` is `xor` ^ `i`, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor` if `xor` is 0 when shifted right by `bit` and bitwise ANDed with 1 is 0. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains unchanged.**

Since `cur_arr` will have one less element, we need to ensure it still contains at least one element for the next iteration. Thus, the final state is:

**State: `xor` is `xor` ^ `i`, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor` if `xor` is 0 when shifted right by `bit` and bitwise ANDed with 1 is 0. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains unchanged.**
