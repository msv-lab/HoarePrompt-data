Postcondition: **`xor` will be the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`, `new_arr` will contain all values of `xor` that were appended during each iteration where `xor` did not have the bit at position `bit` set to 1, `cur_arr` will be empty, and the bit at position `bit` of `xor` is set to 1**.
