Output State: **The program returns the length of the list 'cur_arr'**

Given that the initial state of `bit` is -1, which is not a valid bit position for considering bits in a non-negative integer (as bit positions start from 0), the code simply returns the length of the list `cur_arr`. Since no other operations are performed on `cur_arr` or `bit`, the return value is directly the length of `cur_arr`.
