Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `cur_arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in `cur_arr`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `xor` is updated as `xor ^ i`.
   - `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements.
   - `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered.
   - `bit` is not equal to -1.
   - `new_arr` remains unchanged.
   - `cur_arr` remains unchanged if `xor >> bit & 1` is false.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is taken from `cur_arr`, after one iteration, `i` will be the next element in `cur_arr`.
   - For the loop to continue, `cur_arr` must still contain at least two elements.
   - `bit` will be decremented by 1 for the next iteration (since it represents the current bit position being considered).
   - `new_arr` remains unchanged.
   - `cur_arr` remains unchanged if `xor >> bit & 1` is false.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `xor` will be updated to `xor ^ i` where `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.
   - `cur_arr` must still contain at least two elements.
   - `bit` will be decremented by 1.
   - `new_arr` remains unchanged.
   - `cur_arr` remains unchanged if `xor >> bit & 1` is false.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `xor` is `xor ^ i` where `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements, `bit` is `bit - 1`, `new_arr` remains unchanged, and `cur_arr` remains unchanged if `xor >> bit & 1` is false.**

However, since we need to provide a specific state format, let's assume the next element in `cur_arr` is `i_next` and `bit` is decremented to `bit - 1`:

**State: `xor` is `xor ^ i_next`, `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements, `bit` is `bit - 1`, `new_arr` remains unchanged, and `cur_arr` remains unchanged if `xor >> (bit - 1) & 1` is false.**
