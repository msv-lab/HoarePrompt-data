### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number \( k \) such that we can partition the array into \( k \) segments where the cumulative XOR of each segment does not exceed \( x \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `find_new(arr, 30)`.
   - `find_new` processes the array by considering each bit position from 30 down to 0.
   - For each bit position, it creates a new array (`new_arr`) containing the cumulative XOR values up to that point where the bit is not set.
   - If the current bit of \( x \) is set, it checks whether the maximum segment count can be increased by considering the new array formed in the previous step.
   - If the current bit of \( x \) is not set, it recursively processes the new array formed in the previous step.

3. **Function `find_new` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `new_arr` and a variable `xor` to keep track of the cumulative XOR.
   - It iterates through the array, updating `xor` and appending it to `new_arr` when the bit at the current position is not set.
   - If the bit at the current position is set in `xor`, it sets `thing1` to -1, indicating that no further segments can be added for this bit.
   - If the bit at the current position is not set in `x`, it returns the maximum of the length of `new_arr` and the result of processing the new array with the next lower bit.
   - If the bit at the current position is set in `x`, it returns the maximum of the length of `new_arr` and the result of processing the new array with the next lower bit.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `bit` becomes -1, returning the length of the current array.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the current bit of `x` is set, ensuring that no further segments can be added for that bit.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the current bit of `x` is not set, allowing for further segmentation.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `find_new` ensures that the array is segmented based on the bits of \( x \), and the maximum number of segments is determined.
   - The function correctly returns -1 if no valid segmentation exists.

The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is correct.
