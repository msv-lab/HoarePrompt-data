Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution does not guarantee that the constructed permutation will be k-level. Specifically, the approach used in `func_1` does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. 

For example, consider the case where `n = 10` and `k = 4`. The generated permutation might look like this: `[1, 6, 3, 7, 2, 5, 4, 10, 8, 9]`. Let's check the sums of continuous segments of length 4:

- Sum of segment `[1, 6, 3, 7]`: \(1 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 17\)
- Sum of segment `[6, 3, 7, 2]`: \(6 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 18\)
- Sum of segment `[3, 7, 2, 5]`: \(3 + 7 + 2 + 5 = 17\)
- Sum of segment `[7, 2, 5, 4]`: \(7 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 18\)
- Sum of segment `[2, 5, 4, 10]`: \(2 + 5 + 4 + 10 = 21\)
- Sum of segment `[5, 4, 10, 8]`: \(5 + 4 + 10 + 8 = 27\)
- Sum of segment `[4, 10, 8, 9]`: \(4 + 10 + 8 + 9 = 31\)

Here, the maximum sum is 31 and the minimum sum is 17, so \(\max(s) - \min(s) = 14\), which is greater than 1. Therefore, the permutation does not satisfy the k-level condition.

This example demonstrates that the provided solution does not always generate a k-level permutation, hence the correctness is **False**.
