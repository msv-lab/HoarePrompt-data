You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    bottom_v = 1
    top_v = n
    idx = 0
    while idx < k:
        multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx
        while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
            if idx % 2 == 0:
                permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
                bottom_v += 1
            else:
                permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
                top_v -= 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k
        idx += 1
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a specified number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even, then calls `func_1()` to perform some unspecified operation on these values. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is set to 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to `0`.
   - Two variables `bottom_v` and `top_v` are initialized to `1` and `n` respectively.
   - A loop runs from `idx = 0` to `k-1`. For each `idx`, it updates elements in `permutation` at positions `idx`, `idx + k`, `idx + 2k`, etc.
     - If `idx` is even, it assigns `bottom_v` to the corresponding position and increments `bottom_v`.
     - If `idx` is odd, it assigns `top_v` to the corresponding position and decrements `top_v`.
   - After the loop, it prints the constructed permutation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` `t` times, each time processing one test case.

### Checking the Logic

1. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that elements are assigned in a way that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` will be close to each other.
   - Specifically, the assignment pattern ensures that the smallest values are placed at positions that will contribute to the smaller sums, and the largest values are placed at positions that will contribute to the larger sums.
   - Given that `k` is even, the pattern ensures that the sums of segments will be balanced because the smallest and largest values are alternated in a structured manner.

2. **Ensuring k-Level Permutation**:
   - The construction method ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of segments of length `k` is at most 1.
   - This is because the smallest values are paired with the largest values in a way that minimizes the spread of segment sums.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the example provided:

- For `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
  - The constructed permutation might look like `[1, 10, 4, 7, 2, 9, 3, 8, 5, 6]`.
  - Segment sums would be:
    - `1 + 10 + 4 + 7 = 22`
    - `10 + 4 + 7 + 2 = 23`
    - `4 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 22`
    - `7 + 2 + 9 + 3 = 21`
    - `2 + 9 + 3 + 8 = 22`
    - `9 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 25`
    - `3 + 8 + 5 + 6 = 22`
  - The maximum sum is 25, and the minimum sum is 21, so the difference is 4, which is more than 1. However, this is just one possible permutation, and the construction method should ensure that the difference is at most 1 for any valid permutation.

Given the structured approach and the nature of the problem constraints, the logic in `func_1` should generally produce a k-level permutation.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly constructs a k-level permutation according to the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
