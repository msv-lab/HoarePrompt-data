Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where a k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.
2. The annotated program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_2` handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` until all test cases are processed.
4. `func_1` constructs the permutation based on the following logic:
   - It initializes an array `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two variables `bottom_v` and `top_v` initialized to 1 and `n`, respectively, to alternate values into the permutation array.
   - It iterates over the indices of the permutation array in steps of `k`, filling the array with alternating values from `bottom_v` and `top_v`.
   - This ensures that the values in the permutation array are distributed in an alternating pattern, which helps in maintaining the k-level property.

To verify correctness:
- The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` will be close to each other, thus satisfying the k-level condition.
- The code correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the provided solution should meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
