Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**: 
   - Function `func_1` correctly reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
   - It initializes a permutation list of length \( n \) with all zeros.
   - It fills the permutation list according to an alternating pattern starting from 1 and going up to \( n \). Specifically, it places the smallest available value in the positions that are multiples of \( k \) plus the current index (for even indices) and the largest available value for the rest (for odd indices).
   - This ensures that the difference between any two sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) is at most 1, as required by the problem statement.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - Function `func_2` reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
   - It iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` for each one.
   - After processing all test cases, it ensures that \( t \) is set to 0, indicating the end of processing.

3. **Overall Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format and constraints.
   - It processes each test case appropriately by calling `func_1`.
   - The solution provided in `func_1` meets the requirement of constructing a \( k \)-level permutation for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate a \( k \)-level permutation for each test case as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
