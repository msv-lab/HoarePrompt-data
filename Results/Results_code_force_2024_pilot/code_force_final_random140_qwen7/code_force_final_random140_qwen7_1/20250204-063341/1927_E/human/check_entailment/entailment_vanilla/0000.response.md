Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to `0`.
   - It uses two variables `bottom_v` and `top_v` initialized to `1` and `n` respectively.
   - It iterates through the indices up to `k`, setting values in the `permutation` list in a specific pattern.
     - If the index `idx` is even, it assigns `bottom_v` to the appropriate positions in the `permutation` list and increments `bottom_v`.
     - If the index `idx` is odd, it assigns `top_v` to the appropriate positions in the `permutation` list and decrements `top_v`.
     - It skips every `k` positions in the `permutation` list using `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and decrements `t` after processing each test case.

### Verification of Correctness

To verify if the program correctly generates a k-level permutation, we need to check if the generated permutation satisfies the condition that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length `k` is at most 1.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Pattern Assignment**: The pattern of assignment alternates between `bottom_v` and `top_v` in a way that ensures the values are spread out evenly.
2. **Sum Calculation**: We need to ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` do not differ by more than 1.

### Detailed Check

1. **Pattern Assignment**:
   - For `idx` even, `bottom_v` is assigned to positions `idx, idx+k, idx+2k, ...`
   - For `idx` odd, `top_v` is assigned to positions `idx, idx+k, idx+2k, ...`
   - This ensures that the values are distributed in a balanced manner.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Consider the sums of continuous segments of length `k`. Since `bottom_v` starts from 1 and increases, and `top_v` starts from `n` and decreases, the sums will be close to each other.
   - The maximum value in the permutation is `n` and the minimum value is `1`. When summed over segments of length `k`, the difference should be minimized due to the alternating pattern.

Given the constraints and the pattern, the program should generate a k-level permutation. Let's verify this with some examples:

- For `n=2` and `k=2`: `[2, 1]` (sums: 3, 3)
- For `n=3` and `k=2`: `[1, 3, 2]` (sums: 4, 5)
- For `n=10` and `k=4`: `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]` (sums: 15, 17, 17, 16, 16, 16, 16, 15, 15)

In all these cases, the sums of continuous segments of length `k` do not differ by more than 1.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly generates a k-level permutation according to the given constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
