Postcondition: `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros. If `idx % 2 == 0`, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is set to `1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `bottom_v` is `2`, and `top_v` is reduced by `1`. Otherwise, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is set to `top_v - 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `bottom_v` remains `1`, and `top_v` is reduced by `1`.
