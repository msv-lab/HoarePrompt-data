Output State: **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `bottom_v` to the element in the `permutation` list at the index specified by `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. The condition that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of the specified element in the `permutation` list and the unchanged condition.
