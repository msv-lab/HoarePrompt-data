Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` + `k`, `idx` is less than `len(permutation)`, `bottom_v` is incremented by 1 if `idx` is even, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `bottom_v` if `idx` is even, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `top_v - 1` if `idx` is odd.**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` which is its original value plus `k`.
