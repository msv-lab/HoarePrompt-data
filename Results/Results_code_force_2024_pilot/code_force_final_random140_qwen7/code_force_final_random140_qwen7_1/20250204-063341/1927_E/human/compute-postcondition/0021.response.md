Postcondition: `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros. If `idx` is even, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is set to `1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `bottom_v` is `2`, `top_v` is reduced by `1`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`. If `idx` is odd, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is set to `top_v-1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `bottom_v` remains `1`, `top_v` is reduced by `1`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.
