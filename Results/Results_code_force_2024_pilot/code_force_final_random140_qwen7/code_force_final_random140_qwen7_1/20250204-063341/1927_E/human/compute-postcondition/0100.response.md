Output State: **The permutation list is fully filled according to the alternating pattern starting from 1 and going up to n.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `permutation` list will be completely filled. The loop ensures that every element in the list is assigned a value based on whether its index is even or odd. Specifically:

- For even indices, the values start from `bottom_v` and increment by 1 for each subsequent even index.
- For odd indices, the values start from `top_v` and decrement by 1 for each subsequent odd index.

This process continues until all elements in the `permutation` list are assigned a value. At the end of the loop, `idx` will be equal to `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be equal to `len(permutation) - 1`, `bottom_v` will be `1 + (n // 2) + (len(permutation) // 2)`, and `top_v` will be `n - (n // 2) - (len(permutation) // 2)`. The `permutation` list will contain the numbers from 1 to n in an alternating pattern as described.
