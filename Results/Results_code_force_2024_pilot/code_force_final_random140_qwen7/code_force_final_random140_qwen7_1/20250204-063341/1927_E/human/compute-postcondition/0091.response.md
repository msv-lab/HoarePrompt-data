Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced by `top_v`**.

This means that the value of `permutation` at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated to `top_v`. All other variables remain in their initial state, with the condition that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is still required to be less than the length of `permutation`.
