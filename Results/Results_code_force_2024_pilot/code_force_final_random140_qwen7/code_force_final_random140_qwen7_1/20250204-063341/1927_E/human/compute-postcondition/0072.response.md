Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, `idx` is an even number and less than `len(permutation)`, `bottom_v` is `bottom_v` + 1, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced by `bottom_v`.**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is still equal to `idx`, `idx` is still an even number and less than `len(permutation)`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now set to the new value of `bottom_v`.
