Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated to its current value plus `k`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to either `bottom_v` or `top_v`, `bottom_v` is incremented if `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was updated due to the if condition, and `top_v` is decremented if `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was updated due to the else condition.**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. The other conditions related to setting `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` to either `bottom_v` or `top_v`, and updating `bottom_v` or `top_v` remain unchanged and are still valid post-execution.
