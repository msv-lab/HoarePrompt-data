The loop condition is `idx < k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must be less than `k` at the start of the next iteration. Given that `idx` is increased by 1 during each iteration, we need to ensure that `idx` is less than `k` before the increase.

Let's break down the states:

1. **`idx` is increased by 1**: This means that at the start of the current iteration, `idx` was `k-1`.
2. **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `n-1`**: This state is not directly related to the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.
3. **`bottom_v` is `1 + (n // 2)` and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)`**: These states are also not directly related to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `idx` must be less than `k` at the start of the next iteration. Since `idx` is increased by 1 during each iteration, `idx` must be `k-1` at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `idx` is `k-1`.

State: **`idx` is `k-1`, the permutation list follows the alternating pattern starting from 1 and going up to n, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `n-1`, `bottom_v` is `1 + (n // 2)`, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)` if n is either odd or even**.
