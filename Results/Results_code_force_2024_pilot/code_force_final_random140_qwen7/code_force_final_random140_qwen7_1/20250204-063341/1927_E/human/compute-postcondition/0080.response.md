Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.

2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: We need to ensure that the loop condition is met for the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` so that it becomes less than `len(permutation)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` + `k`.
   - `idx` is less than `len(permutation)`.
   - `bottom_v` is incremented by 1 if `idx` is even.
   - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `bottom_v` if `idx` is even, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `top_v - 1` if `idx` is odd.

4. **Adjust the necessary state**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is incremented by `k` such that it is still less than `len(permutation)`.
   - The other states (`idx`, `bottom_v`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`) do not directly affect the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`**
