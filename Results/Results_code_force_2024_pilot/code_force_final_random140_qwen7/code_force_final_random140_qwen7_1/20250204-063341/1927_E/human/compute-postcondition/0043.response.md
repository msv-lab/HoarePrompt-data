Output State: **`idx` is `k-1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k-1`, `bottom_v` is `1 + (n // 2)`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - 1`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `n - (n // 2)`, and `idx` being odd.**

Explanation: The line `top_v -= 1` decreases the value of `top_v` by 1. Since `top_v` was initially `n - (n // 2)`, after decrementing by 1, its new value becomes `n - (n // 2) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
