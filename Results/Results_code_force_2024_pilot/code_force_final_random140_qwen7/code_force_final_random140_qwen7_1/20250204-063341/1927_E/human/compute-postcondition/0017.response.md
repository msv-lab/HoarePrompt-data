Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, where the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now `1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is reduced by 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.**

This means that the `permutation` list has been updated such that the element at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` (which was initially 0) is now set to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, with `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` being incremented by `k`, `bottom_v` remaining as `1`, `top_v` having been reduced by `1`, and the condition that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n` still holds true.
