The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This means that `t` was greater than 0 before the subtraction and is now equal to `t - 1`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 after the current iteration. Since `t` is already equal to `t - 1`, it implies that `t` was originally greater than 1. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1**
