Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from input, where \( 2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k \) is even. It then constructs and prints a permutation of length \( n \) following an alternating pattern starting from 1 and ending at \( n \). If the conditions are not met, it does not return anything.**
