Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is reduced by 1.**

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. The initial state of `permutation` being a list of `n` zeros, `bottom_v` being 2, and `top_v` being some value (which gets reduced by 1) remains unchanged except for the increment of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. Since `bottom_v` is adjusted to 1 when the condition is met, it is updated to 1. The value of `top_v` is reduced by 1 due to the condition, but its exact value is not specified, only that it is reduced.
