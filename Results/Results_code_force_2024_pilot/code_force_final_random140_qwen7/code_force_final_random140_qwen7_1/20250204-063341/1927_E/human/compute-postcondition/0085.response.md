Postcondition: `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`. If `idx % 2 == 0`, then the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` in `permutation` is updated to `bottom_v + 1`, and `bottom_v` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` in `permutation` is replaced with `top_v`, and `top_v` is decreased by 1.
