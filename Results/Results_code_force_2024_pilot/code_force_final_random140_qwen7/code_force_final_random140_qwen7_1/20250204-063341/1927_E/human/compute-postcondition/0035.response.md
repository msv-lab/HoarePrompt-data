Output State: **`idx` is `k-1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k-1`, `bottom_v` is `1 + (n // 2)`, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)`**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx` assigns the value of `idx` (which is `k-1`) to `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
