Output State: **`idx` is `k-1` and even, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now `k-1` with `bottom_v` stored in `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)`, and `k-1 < len(permutation)`**.

Explanation: The code `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v` updates the element at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` in the list `permutation` to the value of `bottom_v`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was originally `k-1`, it is now storing the value of `bottom_v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
