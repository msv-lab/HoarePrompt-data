Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `bottom_v` is `2`, and `top_v` is reduced by `1`.**

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increases the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. The other variables (`permutation`, `bottom_v`, and `top_v`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
