Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.

2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)` must be true.
   - Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is initially equal to `idx`, we need to ensure that `idx < len(permutation)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.
   - Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is initially equal to `idx`, we need to ensure that `idx < len(permutation)`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `idx < len(permutation)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` and `idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`**
