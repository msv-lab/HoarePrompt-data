Output State: `idx` is `k-1 + k * (len(permutation) // k)`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k-1 + k * (len(permutation) // k) - 1`, `bottom_v` is `1 + (n // 2) + len(permutation) // 2`, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - len(permutation) // 2`, and `permutation` is filled such that even indices are assigned values from `bottom_v` upwards and odd indices are assigned values from `top_v` downwards until all elements are assigned.

Explanation: The loop continues until `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` reaches the length of `permutation`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` increments by `k` each iteration, it will take `len(permutation) // k` iterations to reach the end. After these iterations, `idx` will be `k-1 + k * (len(permutation) // k)`, and since the loop condition is checked before incrementing `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, it will be `len(permutation) - 1`.

The values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` will increase and decrease respectively by the number of iterations, which is `len(permutation) // 2`. Therefore, `bottom_v` will be `1 + (n // 2) + len(permutation) // 2` and `top_v` will be `n - (n // 2) - len(permutation) // 2`.

The `permutation` list will be filled such that even indices are assigned values from `bottom_v` upwards and odd indices are assigned values from `top_v` downwards, ensuring that all elements are assigned a value.
