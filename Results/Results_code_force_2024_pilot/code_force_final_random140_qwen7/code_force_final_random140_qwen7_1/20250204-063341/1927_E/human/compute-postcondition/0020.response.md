Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with one element replaced by `top_v-1` at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `top_v-1`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `top_v` is decreased by 1, so `top_v` becomes `top_v-1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
