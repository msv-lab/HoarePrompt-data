Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced by `top_v`, `top_v` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `top_v` is decreased by 1, but the exact new value of `top_v` cannot be determined without knowing its original value. The conditions and states of the other variables remain unchanged.
