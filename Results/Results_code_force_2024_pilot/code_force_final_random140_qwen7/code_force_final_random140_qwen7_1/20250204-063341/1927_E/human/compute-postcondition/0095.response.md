Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, and either `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v` + 1 (if `idx % 2 == 0`) or `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced by `top_v` and `top_v` is decreased by 1 (if `idx % 2 != 0`).**

This means that the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated by adding `k` to its current value. The conditions regarding `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` remain the same as per the initial postcondition, depending on whether `idx % 2` is even or odd.
