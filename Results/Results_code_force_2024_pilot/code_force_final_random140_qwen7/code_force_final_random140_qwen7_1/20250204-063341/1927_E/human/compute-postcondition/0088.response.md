To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop head. The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.

Let's break down the given information:

- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k` in each iteration.
- `bottom_v` is increased by 1 if `idx % 2 == 0`.
- `top_v` is decreased by 1 if `idx % 2 != 0`.

The loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)` at the start of the next iteration.

Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k` in each iteration, the key state to adjust is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. We need to ensure that after the increase, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is still less than `len(permutation)`.

Since `bottom_v` and `top_v` are not directly involved in the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` to ensure it is less than `len(permutation)` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`**
