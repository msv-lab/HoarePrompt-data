Output State: **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v` + 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` becomes `bottom_v + 1`. The condition that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)` remains unchanged.
