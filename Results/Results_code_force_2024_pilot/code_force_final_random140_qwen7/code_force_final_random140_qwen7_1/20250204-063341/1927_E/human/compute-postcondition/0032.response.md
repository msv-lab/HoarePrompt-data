Output State: The `permutation` list will be filled with alternating values starting from `1` and going up to `n`. Specifically, the list will start with `1`, followed by `n`, then `2`, then `n-1`, and so on, until all elements are filled. The `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` variable will be equal to `n-1` (the last index of the permutation list), `bottom_v` will be `1 + (n // 2)` if `n` is even, or `1 + (n // 2)` if `n` is odd, and `top_v` will be `n - (n // 2)`. 

This pattern continues until all elements in the `permutation` list are filled according to the given rules.
