Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced with `top_v`, `top_v` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `top_v` is decreased by 1, but the exact value of `top_v` before the operation is not specified. The condition that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)` remains unchanged, and the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` in the `permutation` list is still replaced with `top_v`.
