The function processes a specified number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even, then calls `func_1()` to perform some unspecified operation on these values. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is set to 0.
