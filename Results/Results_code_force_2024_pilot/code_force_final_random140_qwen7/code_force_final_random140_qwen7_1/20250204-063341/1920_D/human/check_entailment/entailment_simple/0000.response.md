### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program initializes an array `a` with a single element `[0]`.
   - It reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`.
   - It processes each operation, updating the array `a` and storing the lengths of subarrays in a dictionary `b`.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - For each operation, if the last element of `a` exceeds \(10^{19}\), the operation is skipped.
   - If the operation type is 1, it increments the last element of `a` and stores the corresponding value in `b`.
   - If the operation type is 2, it appends the last element of `a` multiplied by `(e + 1)` to `a`.

3. **Reversing the Array**:
   - The array `a` is reversed, but this step is unnecessary since the array is built correctly without needing reversal.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - The program reads the queries and processes each one using the `func_1` function.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer `x` and checks if it exists in the dictionary `b`.
   - If `x` is in `b`, it returns the corresponding value.
   - If `x` is not in `b`, it iterates through the array `a` to find the correct position of `x` using modulo arithmetic and returns the corresponding value from `b`.

### Analysis:

- The logic for processing operations and storing values in `b` is correct.
- The function `func_1` correctly handles the queries by using modulo arithmetic to find the correct position in the array `a` and returning the corresponding value from `b`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly processes the operations and queries as specified.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
