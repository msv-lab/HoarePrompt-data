You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = [0]
    b = {}
    (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    for i in range(c):
        (d, e) = map(int, input().split())
        if a[-1] > 10 ** 19:
            continue
        if d & 1:
            a[-1] += 1
            b[a[-1]] = e
        else:
            a.append(a[-1] * (e + 1))
    a = a[::-1]
    print(str(list(map(r, input().split())))[1:-1].replace(',', ''))

def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if x in b:
        return b[x]
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        if x in b:
            return b[x]



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a single integer `x` and returns an element from list `b` at index `x`. If `x` is not found in `b`, it returns `None`. The index `x` is initially set to the value of `x` passed as a parameter. If `x` is not found in `b`, the function iterates over the list `a` and updates `x` using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`, where `i` is the current element in `a`. After the loop, if `x` is still not found in `b`, the function returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to handle the operations and queries as described. Specifically, the program does not properly append the array or its copies as required. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Appending Operations**: The program attempts to append elements and their copies but does not correctly update the array `a` as specified. For instance, when an operation of type 2 is performed, the array should be appended `x` times, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

2. **Query Handling**: The program uses a dictionary `b` to store values, but it does not correctly map the positions of elements in the array after all operations are performed. This leads to incorrect results when querying the k-th element.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
```

The expected behavior is:
- After the first operation, `a = [1]`.
- After the second operation, `a = [1, 2]`.
- After the third operation, `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`.
- After the fourth operation, `a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.
- After the fifth operation, `a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.

However, the provided program does not correctly simulate these operations. For example, after the fifth operation, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`, but the program does not achieve this state.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly handle the operations and produce the expected results for the queries, making it incorrect.
