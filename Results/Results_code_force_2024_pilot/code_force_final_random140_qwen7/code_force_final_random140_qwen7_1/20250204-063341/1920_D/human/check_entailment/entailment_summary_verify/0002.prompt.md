You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a single integer `x` and returns an element from list `b` at index `x`. If `f` equals 0, the function raises an error because `b` is not defined. Otherwise, the function iterates through a list `a` and updates `x` based on certain conditions. After completing the iterations, it returns the value at the updated index `x` in list `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes `a` with `[0, 0]` and creates a dictionary `b`.
   - It then reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - The program iterates through each operation.
   - If the operation type `d` is 1, it increments the last element of `a` and stores the value `e` in the dictionary `b` at the new index.
   - If the operation type `d` is 2, it checks if there is a non-zero difference between the last two elements of `a`. If so, it appends the last element of `a` to `a` and updates the count accordingly. It also updates the dictionary `b` for the new indices.
   - If the difference is zero, it updates the previous element of `a` and sets the current element to the updated value.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - After processing all operations, the program reads the query indices and uses a function `func_1` to find the k-th element in the array `a`.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - This part is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - The logic for appending elements and updating the array `a` is mostly correct but has some issues:
     - When `d` is 2 and `a[-1] - a[-2]` is non-zero, it correctly appends the last element and updates the count.
     - However, when `d` is 2 and `a[-1] - a[-2]` is zero, it incorrectly updates the previous element without properly handling the new structure of the array.
     - The dictionary `b` is not updated correctly for the new indices generated by the second type of operation.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find the k-th element using the structure of `a` and the dictionary `b`.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not correctly handle the structure of the array `a` after the second type of operation.

### Correctness Check:

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly handle the structure of the array `a` after the second type of operation, leading to incorrect results for queries.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed handling of the array structure after the second type of operation.

**Correctness: **False**
