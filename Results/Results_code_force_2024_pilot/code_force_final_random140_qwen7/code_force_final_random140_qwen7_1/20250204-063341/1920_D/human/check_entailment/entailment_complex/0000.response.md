### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided annotated program and the function `func_1` to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to find the k-th element in the array `a` after performing the specified operations.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Appending Operations**: Ensure that the operations are correctly appended to the array `a`.
2. **Query Handling**: Ensure that the function `func_1` correctly handles the queries by finding the k-th element in the final array `a`.

#### Analysis of the Program:
- **Initialization**: The array `a` starts with `[0]` and a dictionary `b` is used to store certain values.
- **Operations Loop**: For each operation, the program checks if the last element of `a` exceeds \(10^{19}\). If it does, the operation is skipped. Otherwise, it updates the last element of `a` or appends new elements based on the operation type.
- **Reversing Array**: The array `a` is reversed before processing queries.
- **Query Processing**: The function `func_1` is called with the query values. This function uses a dictionary `b` to store intermediate results and calculates the k-th element using modulo arithmetic.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Dictionary Check**: The function first checks if the queried index `x` is directly in the dictionary `b`. If so, it returns the corresponding value.
- **Modulo Arithmetic**: If `x` is not in `b`, the function iterates over the array `a` and applies the modulo operation to find the correct position in the array.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the value from `b` if found; otherwise, it returns `None`.

#### Correctness Verification:
- **Appending Logic**: The program correctly appends elements and copies to the array `a` based on the given operations.
- **Query Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly handles the queries by using the modulo operation to find the correct position in the array `a` after all operations.

Given the provided example and the structure of the program, the logic seems to be implemented correctly. The function `func_1` correctly handles the queries by leveraging the dictionary `b` and the modulo arithmetic to find the k-th element in the final array `a`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program and the function `func_1` appear to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement and the given examples.

**Correctness: True**
