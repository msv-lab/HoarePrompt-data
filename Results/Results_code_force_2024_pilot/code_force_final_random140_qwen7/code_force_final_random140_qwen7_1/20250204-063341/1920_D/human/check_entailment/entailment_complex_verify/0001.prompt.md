You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The first integer indicates the type of operation (1 or 2), and the second integer indicates the value or the number of copies involved in the operation. Additionally, the size of the array after performing all operations is at most \(10^{18}\), and the queries are integers \(k_i\) such that \(1 \leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c)\), where \(c\) is the size of the array after all operations.
def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns an element from list `b` at index `x`, where `x` is an integer and exists within the range of indices of list `b`
    #State: `x` is an integer, and `x` is not in `b`

    #State: Output State: The function returns the element at index `x` in list `b`, where `x` is calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1` and `i` is the last element in list `a`, if `x` is found in list `b`. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the function will check the final value of `x` against the list `b`. If `x` is found in `b`, it will return the element at that index. If `x` is not found in `b`, the function will return `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single integer `x` and returns an element from list `b` at index `x`. If `x` is not found in `b`, it returns `None`. The index `x` is initially set to the value of `x` passed as a parameter. If `x` is not found in `b`, the function iterates over the list `a` and updates `x` using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`, where `i` is the current element in `a`. After the loop, if `x` is still not found in `b`, the function returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of operations) and `q` (number of queries).
   - It initializes an array `a` with a single element `[0]` and a dictionary `b`.

2. **Processing Operations:**
   - It iterates through `n` operations.
   - For each operation, it reads the operation type (`d`) and value (`e`).
   - If the last element of `a` exceeds \(10^{19}\), it skips the operation.
   - If the operation type is 1, it increments the last element of `a` and updates the dictionary `b` with the new length and the corresponding value.
   - If the operation type is 2, it appends `e` copies of the current array `a` to itself.

3. **Reversing Array and Query Processing:**
   - The array `a` is reversed.
   - It reads `q` queries and processes each query using a function `func_1`.

4. **Query Processing Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a query index `x`.
   - It converts `x` to an integer.
   - If `x` is found in the dictionary `b`, it returns the corresponding value.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the array `a` to find the position of `x` and returns the corresponding value from the dictionary `b`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Handling Large Values:**
   - The program checks if `a[-1] > 10^19` and skips operations if true. However, this check is not sufficient because the problem guarantees that the array size will never exceed \(10^{18}\). Therefore, the check should be removed or handled more robustly.

2. **Array Reversal and Query Handling:**
   - The array `a` is reversed, but the problem specifies that the array should be processed in the original order. Reversing the array can lead to incorrect results for queries.

3. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle queries, but it incorrectly handles the modulo operation and the logic for finding the correct position in the array. The logic should directly map the query index to the correct position in the array without reversing it.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain the array in its original order and use a more efficient way to handle queries. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = []
    b = {}
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    
    for i in range(n):
        (d, e) = map(int, input().split())
        if d == 1:
            a.append(e)
            b[len(a)] = e
        elif d == 2:
            a.extend([a[-1]] * (e - 1))
            b[len(a)] = a[-1]
    
    res = []
    for k in map(int, input().split()):
        pos = k
        for i in range(len(a) - 1, 0, -1):
            if pos <= i:
                res.append(b[i])
                break
            pos -= i
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Conclusion

The original program has several issues, including incorrect handling of large values, array reversal, and query processing logic. The corrected approach maintains the array in its original order and uses a more efficient method to process queries.
