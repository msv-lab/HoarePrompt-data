Precondition: **x is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The first integer indicates the type of operation (1 or 2), and the second integer indicates the value or the number of copies involved in the operation. Additionally, the size of the array after performing all operations is at most \(10^{18}\), and the queries are integers \(k_i\) such that \(1 \leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c)\), where \(c\) is the size of the array after all operations.**
