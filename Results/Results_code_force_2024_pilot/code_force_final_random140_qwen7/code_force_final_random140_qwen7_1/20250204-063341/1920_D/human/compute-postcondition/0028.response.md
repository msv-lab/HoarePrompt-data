Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the range is specified as `range(f - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `i` starts from `f - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(f - 1, -1, -1)`. The postcondition given is that `i` is `x + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Determine the new state of `i`**: Since the loop is decrementing `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` was `x + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `x`.

4. **Check the condition**: The condition to continue the loop is that `a[2 * i]` must be greater than or equal to `x`. However, since the problem states that the value of `i` remains `x + 1` regardless of the condition, we don't need to consider the condition explicitly for adjusting the state.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `x`**
