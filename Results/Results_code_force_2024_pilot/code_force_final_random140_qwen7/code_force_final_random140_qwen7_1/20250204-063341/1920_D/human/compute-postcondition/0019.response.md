Output State: The function returns the element at index `x` in list `b`, where `x` is calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1` and `i` is the last element in list `a`, if `x` is found in list `b`. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the function will return the element in list `b` at the index determined by the final value of `x`, which is updated in each iteration according to the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`. If `x` is not found in list `b` after processing all elements in `a`, the function returns `None`.
