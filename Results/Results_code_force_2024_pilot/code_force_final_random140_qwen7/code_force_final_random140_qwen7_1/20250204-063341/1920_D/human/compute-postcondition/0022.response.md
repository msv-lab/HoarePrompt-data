Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `x` and returns an element from list `b` at index `x`. If `x` is not found in `b`, it returns `None`. The index `x` is initially set to the value of `x` passed as a parameter. If `x` is not found in `b`, the function iterates over the list `a` and updates `x` using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`, where `i` is the current element in `a`. After the loop, if `x` is still not found in `b`, the function returns `None`.**
