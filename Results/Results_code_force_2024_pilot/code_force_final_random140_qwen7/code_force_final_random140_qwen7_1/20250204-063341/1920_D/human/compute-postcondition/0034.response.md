Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list of integers representing operations and queries. The function returns the value at index `x` in the list `b` after performing all operations and queries specified in the list `x`.**

In natural language: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list of integers representing operations and queries. These operations include appending an integer or appending multiple copies of the current array. The function then processes each operation in the list `x` to modify the list `b`. After all operations and queries are processed, the function returns the value at the index specified by the final value of `x` in the list `b`.
