You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The first integer indicates the type of operation (1 or 2), and the second integer indicates the value or the number of copies involved in the operation. Additionally, the size of the array after performing all operations is at most \(10^{18}\), and the queries are integers \(k_i\) such that \(1 \leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c)\), where \(c\) is the size of the array after all operations.
def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns an element from list `b` at index `x`, where `x` is an integer and exists within the range of indices of list `b`
    #State: `x` is an integer, and `x` is not in `b`
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: Output State: The function returns the element at index `x` in list `b`, where `x` is calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1` and `i` is the last element in list `a`, if `x` is found in list `b`. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the function will check the final value of `x` against the list `b`. If `x` is found in `b`, it will return the element at that index. If `x` is not found in `b`, the function will return `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers: the first integer represents the type of operation (1 or 2), and the second integer represents the value or the number of copies involved in the operation. The function returns an element from list `b` at index `x`, where `x` is an integer and exists within the range of indices of list `b`. If `x` is calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1` and `i` is the first element in the list `a`, the function returns an element from collection `b` at the adjusted index. If `x` is not present in list `b`, the function returns the element at the adjusted index. If `x` is calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1` and `i` is the third element in list `a`, the function returns the element at the adjusted index.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns an element from list `b` at index `x`, where `x` is an integer and exists within the range of indices of list `b`

Case_2: The program returns an element from collection `b` at index `x`, where `x` is calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1` and `i` is the first element in the list `a`

Case_3: The program returns the element at index x in list b, where x is an integer equal to (x - 1) % i + 1 and x is not present in list b.

Case_4: The program returns the element at index x in list b, where x is calculated as (x - 1) % i + 1 and i is the third element in list a.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
