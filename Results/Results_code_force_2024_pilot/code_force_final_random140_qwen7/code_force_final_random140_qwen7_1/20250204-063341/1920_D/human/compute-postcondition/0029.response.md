Output State: **`i` is `x` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `i` or `x`, their values remain unchanged. The statement "we continue to the next iteration of the loop" indicates that the control flow will proceed to the next cycle of the loop without executing any further statements in the current iteration.
