State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is not in `b`, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head involves the variable `i` which iterates over the elements of the list `a`.
2. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element (otherwise, the loop would not run).
3. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in the list `a` during the first iteration of the loop.
4. There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment based on the given information.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the state must include that `a` is a non-empty list and `i` is set to the first element of `a`.
