### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.
   - Each move either adds or removes exactly one cube.
   - After `n` moves, the net change in the number of cubes must be `m`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     1. If `n < m`, it prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it's not always true that `n < m` when `m` cubes cannot be achieved.
     2. The second condition checks if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even using the bitwise AND operation (`&`). This is a correct approach because the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` must match for the operations to balance out correctly.

3. **Correctness of the Conditions:**
   - The first condition `if n < m:` is incorrect. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 3`, it should be possible to achieve `m` cubes by removing 2 cubes, but the code incorrectly returns 'NO'.
   - The second condition correctly ensures that the parity of `n` and `m` matches, which is necessary for the operations to result in `m` cubes.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The code should check if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both odd or both even) without checking `n < m`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if (n % 2 == m % 2):  # Check if n and m have the same parity
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Answer:
The original code is incorrect because it incorrectly checks `n < m`. The corrected version checks the parity of `n` and `m` and prints 'YES' if they have the same parity, which is the correct approach.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issue with the condition `n < m` but was incorrect in stating that the second condition was also flawed. The second condition is actually correct. Therefore, the final evaluation is **False**.
