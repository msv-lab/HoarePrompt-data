### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.
   - Each move either adds or removes exactly one cube.
   - After `n` moves, the net change in the number of cubes must be `m`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     1. If `n < m`, it prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it's not always true that `n < m` when `m` cubes cannot be achieved.
     2. The second condition checks if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even using the bitwise AND operation (`&`). This is a correct approach because the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` must match for the operations to balance out correctly.

3. **Correctness of the Conditions:**
   - The first condition `if n < m:` is incorrect. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 3`, it should be possible to achieve `m` cubes, but the code incorrectly returns 'NO'.
   - The second condition correctly ensures that the parity of `n` and `m` matches, which is necessary for the operations to result in `m` cubes.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The code should check if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both odd or both even) without checking `n < m`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if (n % 2 == m % 2):  # Check if n and m have the same parity
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Evaluation of Annotations:
- **Initial State:** The state before the function call is correctly described.
- **Loop Iteration:** The loop iterates `t` times, reading pairs of integers `n` and `m`.
- **Condition Analysis:**
  - The condition `if n < m:` is indeed incorrect as it does not correctly determine if `m` cubes can be achieved.
  - The condition `if n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0):` is correct for checking the parity of `n` and `m`.

### Final Answer:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the mistake in the first condition and the correctness of the second condition. The corrected code provided in the original assessment is indeed the correct implementation.

**Final: True**
