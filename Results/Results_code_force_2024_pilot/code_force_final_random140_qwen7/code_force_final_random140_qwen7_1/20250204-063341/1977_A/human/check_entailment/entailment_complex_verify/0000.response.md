### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- We need to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.
- The program should output "Yes" if it's possible and "No" otherwise.

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0):
            print('YES')
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The program iterates over the number of test cases specified by `t`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- It then checks:
  - If `n < m`, it prints "NO".
  - Otherwise, it checks if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even using the bitwise AND operator (`&`) and prints "YES".

#### Correctness Check:
1. **Case `n < m`:**
   - If `n < m`, the program correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.

2. **Case `n >= m`:**
   - The condition `n & 1 and m & 1` checks if both `n` and `m` are odd.
   - The condition `n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0` checks if both `n` and `m` are even.
   - The OR operator `or` combines these two conditions, meaning the program prints "YES" if either both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even.

However, the original assessment is correct in pointing out that the program does not fully capture the requirement that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even. Let's consider why:

- If `n` is odd and `m` is even, or vice versa, the difference `n - m` is odd, which means it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves because each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either adding or removing one cube).

To fix this, we need to check if the absolute difference `|n - m|` is even. This ensures that the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the desired number of cubes.

#### Corrected Condition:
We need to replace the current condition with `abs(n - m) % 2 == 0`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate because the current implementation does not correctly handle cases where the difference between `n` and `m` is odd. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
