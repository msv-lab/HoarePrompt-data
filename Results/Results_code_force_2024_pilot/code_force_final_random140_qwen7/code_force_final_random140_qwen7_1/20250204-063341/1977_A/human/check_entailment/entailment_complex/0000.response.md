Reasoning:
- The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- The condition `if n < m: print('NO')` correctly identifies when it's impossible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- However, the condition `elif n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:` is flawed. This condition checks if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even, which is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even because each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either adding or removing one cube). Therefore, the difference between the final number of cubes (`m`) and the initial number of cubes (0) must be even to be achievable through an even number of additions and subtractions.

Given the above reasoning, the function is incorrect because it does not properly account for the parity of the difference between `n` and `m`.

Correctness: **False**
