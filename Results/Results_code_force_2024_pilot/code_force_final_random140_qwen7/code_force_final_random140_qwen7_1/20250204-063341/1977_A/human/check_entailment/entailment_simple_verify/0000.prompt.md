You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0):
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will include a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions provided within the loop body for each pair of integers \(n\) and \(m\) entered. Specifically, for each pair:
    #
    #- If \(n < m\), the output will be 'NO'.
    #- Otherwise, if \(n\) and \(m\) are both odd or both even, the output will be 'YES'. 
    #
    #All other variables outside the loop (such as the initial value of \(t\)) will retain their original values from the initial state, assuming no further inputs or modifications are made outside the loop during its execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the cases where the number of moves `n` is odd and the desired number of cubes `m` is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, so the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` should be the same. However, the current implementation checks only the parity of `n` and `m` separately and prints 'YES' if they are both odd or both even. This logic is insufficient because it does not account for the fact that the total number of moves must equal the change in the number of cubes.

For example, consider the test case `n = 3` and `m = 2`. Here, `n` is odd and `m` is even, but the program would incorrectly print 'YES'. The correct approach would be to check if `abs(n - m)` is even, which ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is achievable through a series of additions and removals of one cube at a time.
