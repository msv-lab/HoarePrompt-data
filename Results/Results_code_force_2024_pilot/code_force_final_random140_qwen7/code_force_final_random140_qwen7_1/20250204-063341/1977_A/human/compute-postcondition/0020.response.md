Output State: **`n` is the first positive integer entered, `m` is the second positive integer entered**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated positive integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. Since the input must be a positive integer, the values of `n` and `m` will be the integers entered by the user. The precondition that the next input must be a positive integer is now satisfied for subsequent inputs, but no further details about future inputs are provided in the current context.
