Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.
   - We need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` results in a valid number of iterations.

3. **Constraints and Validations**:
   - The variable `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - Each test case within the loop involves values of `n` and `m` such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop will run for `t` times, `t` must be a valid integer within the specified range.
   - The initial state of `t` is already provided as a positive integer between 1 and 100, so no further adjustment is needed for `t`.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer input from the user.
   - For the loop to execute, the input must result in a valid integer `t` within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input that will be provided to `int(input())`, ensuring it is a valid integer within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the input provided to `int(input())` must result in an integer within this range.**
