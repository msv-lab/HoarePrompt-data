Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value, which is converted to an integer and used as the range limit.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if the input value (converted to an integer) is a positive integer. This means that the loop will execute again if the user inputs a positive integer.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `n` and `m` are integers, and they are either both odd or both even.
   - If `n` is less than `m`, the program continues with the next input being a positive integer.
   - If `n` is not less than `m`, the program also continues with the next input being a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on the input value, the next input must be a positive integer.
   - The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- The next input must be a positive integer.

So, the final answer is:
State: **The next input must be a positive integer**
