Output State: The loop has executed for all provided test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers where either both are odd or both are even. If `n` is less than `m`, the program prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case. Otherwise, it checks if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, and if so, prints 'YES'. The values of `n` and `m` for each test case remain unchanged after processing, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.
