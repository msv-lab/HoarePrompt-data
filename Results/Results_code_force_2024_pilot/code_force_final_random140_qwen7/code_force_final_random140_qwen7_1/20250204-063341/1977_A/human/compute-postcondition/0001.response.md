Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split**.

This means that the code reads two integers from the user input and splits them into `n` and `m`. The exact values of `n` and `m` depend on the input provided by the user, but they are now stored as integers in the variables `n` and `m`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
