Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000` (which represents the maximum possible value for `k`).
2. **Reading Constraints**: It reads the number of constraints `n` and then iterates over each constraint to update `start`, `end`, and a list of values that `k` must not be equal to (`num`).
   - For `t == 1`, it updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and `v`.
   - For `t == 2`, it updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and `v`.
   - For `t == 3`, it appends `v` to the list `num`.
3. **Counting Valid Values**: After processing all constraints, it counts the number of values in `num` that lie between `start` and `end`. These values are invalid, so they are subtracted from the total count of valid values (`end - start + 1`).
4. **Returning Result**: Finally, it returns the count of valid values, which is `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start <= end`, otherwise `0`.

The logic handles all constraints correctly and ensures that the answer is finite and valid according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
