### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints. Constraints are of three types:
   - \( k \geq x \)
   - \( k \leq x \)
   - \( k \neq x \)

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function reads an integer input from the standard input. It is used to read the number of test cases (`n`).
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings or characters. It is not used in the main logic.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function concatenates a list of integers with a separator. It is not used in the main logic.
   - **Function `func_4`**: This function finds all occurrences of a substring in a string. It is not used in the main logic.
   - **Function `func_5`**: This function returns the indices of a specific element in a list. It is not used in the main logic.
   - **Function `func_6`**: This function returns a sub-array from a list of lists where a specific element matches a given value. It is not used in the main logic.
   - **Function `func_7`**: This function is the core logic of the program. It processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \).

3. **Function `func_7` Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: 
     - `n` is read from the input.
     - `start` is initialized to `-1`.
     - `end` is initialized to `1000000000`.
     - `num` is an empty list.
   - **Processing Constraints**:
     - For each constraint, `t` and `v` are read.
     - If `t` is 1, `start` is updated to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
     - If `t` is 2, `end` is updated to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
     - If `t` is 3, `v` is appended to `num`.
   - **Counting Valid Integers**:
     - A loop iterates over `num` and increments `count_num` if `v` is within the range `[start, end]`.
     - The result is calculated as `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start <= end`, otherwise 0.

4. **Correctness**:
   - **Initialization**: `start` is initialized to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000`. These values ensure that any valid constraints will update them appropriately.
   - **Handling Constraints**: The function correctly updates `start` and `end` based on the constraints.
   - **Excluding Values**: The function correctly counts the number of values excluded by the "not equal" constraints.
   - **Range Calculation**: The final result is calculated correctly by subtracting the count of excluded values from the range `[start, end]`.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.
