Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and calculate the valid range for `k`. Specifically, the logic for updating `start` and `end` is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `start` and `end` are initialized incorrectly. `start` is set to `-1`, which will not properly reflect the minimum value from the constraints.

2. **Constraint Handling**:
   - For `t == 1`, `start` should be updated to the maximum of its current value and `v`.
   - For `t == 2`, `end` should be updated to the minimum of its current value and `v`.

3. **Exclusion of Specific Values**:
   - The program correctly appends values to `num` that are excluded by `t == 3`.
   - However, the logic for counting these excluded values is incorrect. It should check if the excluded value lies within the range `[start, end]` and subtract the count of such values from the total range.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = float('inf')
    end = -float('inf')
    num = set()
    for _ in range(n):
        t, v = map(int, input().split())
        if t == 1:
            start = min(start, v)
        elif t == 2:
            end = max(end, v)
        elif t == 3:
            num.add(v)

    # Calculate the valid range
    valid_range = end - start + 1

    # Subtract the count of excluded values
    for v in num:
        if start <= v <= end:
            valid_range -= 1

    return valid_range
```

This corrected function ensures that:
- `start` and `end` are correctly initialized to represent the minimum and maximum bounds.
- The excluded values are correctly counted and subtracted from the valid range.
