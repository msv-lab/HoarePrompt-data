isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to use pre-defined input or not. If isOne is True, the input format and content are predefined. Otherwise, the input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) – the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) – the number of constraints. The following n lines describe the constraints, each containing two integers a and x (a ∈ {1,2,3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), where a denotes the type of constraint.
