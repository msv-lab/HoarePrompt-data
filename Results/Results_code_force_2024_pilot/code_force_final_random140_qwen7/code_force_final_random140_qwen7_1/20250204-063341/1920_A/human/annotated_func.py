    else :

        #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns the integer `1`. If `isOne` is `False`, it reads an integer input from the standard input and returns that integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of n constraints where n is an integer. Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x, where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9.

There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. `items` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `line` by spaces if there is a space in the string, otherwise `items` is a list of characters obtained from the input string `line`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `space`, which is a string, and `to_int`, which is a boolean. If `to_int` is True, it splits the string `space` by spaces (if present) and converts each item to an integer, returning a list of integers. If `to_int` is False, it returns a list of strings or characters from the input string `space` based on whether it contains a space. The function reads an input line, processes it according to the given conditions, and returns a list of integers or strings/characters accordingly.

    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `arr` must contain at least 4 elements. The variable `string` will be a concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `arr`, separated by `sym`. The variable `i` will be the last element in the list `arr`.
    return string
    #`The program returns a string that is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in list 'arr', separated by 'sym', with 'i' being the last element in 'arr'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It concatenates the string representations of all elements in `arr`, separating them with `sym`, and returns the resulting string. The last element in `arr` is included without a trailing `sym`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `string`, which is a string, and `substring`, which is a non-empty string and a substring of `string`. It returns a list containing all the starting positions where `substring` is found within `string`. If `substring` is not found in `string`, it returns a list containing only -1. Otherwise, it returns a list containing the starting positions of all occurrences of `substring` in `string`.

    #
    #This output state is derived from the fact that the loop continues to iterate through each subArray in `arr` until it finds a subArray where the element at the specified `index` is not equal to `value`. Once such a subArray is found, it is immediately returned. If the loop completes without finding any such subArray, the function returns `None`.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, an `index`, and an integer `value`. It searches through each subArray in `arr` and returns the first subArray where the element at the specified `index` is either equal to `value` (Case_1 and Case_3) or not equal to `value` (Case_2). If no such subArray is found, it returns `None` (Case_4).

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1, `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2, `num` will be a list containing all `v` where `t` was 3, and `t` and `v` will be the last input integers read during the loop execution.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
    #- The variable `n` will stay within its initial range (between 2 and 100).
    #- The variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, indicating the total number of iterations executed.
    #- `start` will hold the smallest value of `v` where `t` was 1.
    #- `end` will hold the largest value of `v` where `t` was 2.
    #- `num` will contain all values of `v` where `t` was 3.

    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns 0 if end is less than start, otherwise it returns the difference between end and start plus one minus the count_num which is the number of iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of inputs to determine the count of valid numbers within a specified range. It first reads an integer `n` representing the number of inputs. For each input, it updates the minimum value (`start`) when `t` is 1, the maximum value (`end`) when `t` is 2, and appends the value (`v`) to the list `num` when `t` is 3. After processing all inputs, it counts how many numbers in `num` fall within the range defined by `start` and `end`. Finally, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus the count of valid numbers, or 0 if `end` is less than `start`.
