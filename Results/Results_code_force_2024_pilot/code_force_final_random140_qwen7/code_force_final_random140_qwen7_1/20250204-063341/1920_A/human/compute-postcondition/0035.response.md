Postcondition: `n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, `t` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `t` and `v` are updated to integers from input. If `end > v`, then `end` remains `v`; otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.
