Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `start` is the minimum of the original `start` and `v`, `end` is `v` if the current value of `v` is less than 1000000000, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` equals 3, `t` is an integer from input with the current value of 3, `v` is an integer from input, `t` is updated to an integer from input, `v` is updated to an integer from input.**

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two inputs separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `t` and `v`. The values of `n`, `i`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise. The value of `num` will be a list containing `v` if `t` was originally 3, which it is. After the code executes, `t` and `v` are updated to the new input values.
