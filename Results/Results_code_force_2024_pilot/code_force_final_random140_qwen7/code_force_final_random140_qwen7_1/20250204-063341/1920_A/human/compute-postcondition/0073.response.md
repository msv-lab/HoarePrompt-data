Output State: **The program returns 0 if end is less than start, otherwise it returns the difference between end and start plus one minus the count_num which is the number of iterations.**

This natural language description clarifies that the return value depends on the comparison between `end` and `start`. If `end` is less than `start`, the program returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the difference between `end` and `start`, adds one, and subtracts `count_num` (the number of iterations).
