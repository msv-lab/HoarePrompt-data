Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `num`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `num`. The variable `i` takes on each value from the list `num` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the Final States**:
   - `n` must be between 2 and 100 after all iterations.
   - `i` will be equal to `n-1` after the loop completes.
   - `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1.
   - `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2.
   - `num` will be a list containing all `v` where `t` was 3.
   - `t` and `v` will be the last input integers read during the loop execution.
   - `count_num` is 0.

4. **Adjust the Initial State**:
   - Since `i` will be equal to `n-1` after the loop, `n` must be set to `i+1` initially.
   - The values of `start`, `end`, and `num` are determined by the loop body, so they don't need to be adjusted directly.
   - `t` and `v` will be the last inputs, so they should be set to some initial values (e.g., `t = 0` and `v = None`).
   - `count_num` is 0, so it doesn't need adjustment.

Given these points, the initial state before the loop should be:

- `n` is set to `i+1` (since `i` will be `n-1` after the loop).
- `t` and `v` are initialized to some initial values (e.g., `t = 0` and `v = None`).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`n` is 1 more than the initial value of `i`, `t` is 0, `v` is None, `start` is undefined, `end` is undefined, `num` is an empty list, `count_num` is 0**.

However, since `start`, `end`, and `num` are determined by the loop body, they don't need to be explicitly adjusted. The key adjustments are related to `n`, `t`, `v`, and `count_num`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`n` is 1 more than the initial value of `i`, `t` is 0, `v` is None, `count_num` is 0**.
