Postcondition: `n` must be between 2 and 100, `start` is either `v` (if `start < v` is true) or remains -1 (if `start < v` is false), `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer from input with the current value of 1, `v` is an integer from input, and the current value of `v` satisfies the condition `start < v` if `start` is updated.
