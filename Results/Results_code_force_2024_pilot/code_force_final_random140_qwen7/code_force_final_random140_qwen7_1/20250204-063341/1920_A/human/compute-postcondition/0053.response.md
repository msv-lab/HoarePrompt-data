Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1, `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2, `num` will be a list containing all `v` where `t` was 3, and `t` and `v` will be the last input integers read during the loop execution.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `n` will stay within its initial range (between 2 and 100).
- The variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, indicating the total number of iterations executed.
- `start` will hold the smallest value of `v` where `t` was 1.
- `end` will hold the largest value of `v` where `t` was 2.
- `num` will contain all values of `v` where `t` was 3.
- The final values of `t` and `v` will be those provided as input in the last iteration of the loop.
