Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, and `num` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `end = int(1000000000.0)` does not change the value of `end` since `1000000000.0` is already an integer. Therefore, the value of `end` remains `1000000000`. All other variables (`n`, `start`, and `num`) remain unchanged.
