Output State: **`n` is `i + 2`, `t` is 0, `v` is `None`, and `count_num` remains either 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether `i` is within or outside the range of `start` and `end`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables `n`, `t`, `v`, and `count_num` remain unchanged from their initial states.
