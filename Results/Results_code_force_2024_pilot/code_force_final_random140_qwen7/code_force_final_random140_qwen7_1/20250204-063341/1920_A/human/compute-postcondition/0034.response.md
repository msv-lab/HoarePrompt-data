Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, `t` is an integer from input with the current value of 3, `v` is an integer from input, `t` is updated to an integer from input, `v` is updated to an integer from input. If `end > v`, then `end` remains `v`; otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Given the initial state, `num` was initially empty and now contains `[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
