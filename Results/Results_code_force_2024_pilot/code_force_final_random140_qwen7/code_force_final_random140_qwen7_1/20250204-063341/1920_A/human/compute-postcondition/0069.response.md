Output State: **`n` is `i + 2`, `t` is 0, `v` is `None`, `count_num` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the initial value of `count_num`.**

Explanation: The line `count_num += 1` increments the value of `count_num` by 1. Since the initial value of `count_num` can only be 0, 1, or 2, after incrementing, it will become 1, 2, or 3 respectively. The values of `n`, `t`, `v`, and the condition for `count_num` remain unchanged.
