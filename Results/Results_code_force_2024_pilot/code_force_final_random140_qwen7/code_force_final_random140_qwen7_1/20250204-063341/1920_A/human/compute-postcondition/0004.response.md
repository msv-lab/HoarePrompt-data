State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

### Explanation:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0 for the loop to start executing. Given that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, this condition is already met within the specified range.
4. **Other Variables**: The variables `start`, `end`, and `num` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Thus, the required adjustments are to ensure `n` is within the specified range (between 2 and 100) and that `i` is set to 0.
