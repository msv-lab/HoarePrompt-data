Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `start` is the minimum of the original `start` and `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer from input with the current value of 2, and `v` is an integer from input, and the current value of `v` is less than 1000000000.**

Explanation: The code `end = v` updates the value of `end` to be equal to the current value of `v`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `v` is less than 1000000000, the updated value of `end` is `v`.
