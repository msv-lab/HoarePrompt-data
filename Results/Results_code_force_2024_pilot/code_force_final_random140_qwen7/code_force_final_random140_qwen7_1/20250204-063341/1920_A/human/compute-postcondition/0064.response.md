Output State: **`n` is `i + 1`, `t` is 0, `v` is `None`, `count_num` remains either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the given initial state and the `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables, the values remain the same as they were before the statement was executed.
