Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be between 2 and 100.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body (based on the given information).

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `start`: It is the minimum of the original `start` and `v`. Since no changes are mentioned, it remains the same.
   - `end`: It is `v` if the current value of `v` is less than 1000000000. Since no changes are mentioned, it remains the same.
   - `num`: It contains the value of `v` if `t` equals 3. Since `t` is still 3, `num` remains the same.
   - `t`: It is an integer from input with the current value of 3. Since no changes are mentioned, it remains the same.
   - `v`: It is an integer from input. Since no changes are mentioned, it remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `start` is the minimum of the original `start` and `v`, `end` is `v` if the current value of `v` is less than 1000000000, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` equals 3, `t` is an integer from input with the current value of 3, and `v` is an integer from input**.
