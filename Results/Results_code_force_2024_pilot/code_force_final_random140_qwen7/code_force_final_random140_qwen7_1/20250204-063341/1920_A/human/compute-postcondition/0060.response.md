Output State: **`count_num` is 1, `n` is 1 more than the initial value of `i`, `t` is 0, `v` is None, and the value of `i` is within the range of `start` and `end`.**

The code increments `count_num` by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `v`, `i`, `start`, and `end`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
