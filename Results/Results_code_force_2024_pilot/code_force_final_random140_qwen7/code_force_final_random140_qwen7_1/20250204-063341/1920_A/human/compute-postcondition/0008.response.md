Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `start` is `v`, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer from input with the current value of 1, `v` is an integer from input, and the current value of `v` satisfies the condition start < v**.

Explanation: The line `start = v` updates the value of `start` to be equal to the current value of `v`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `v` satisfies the condition `start < v`, after the assignment, `start` will now be equal to `v`, and the condition `start < v` will no longer hold true.
