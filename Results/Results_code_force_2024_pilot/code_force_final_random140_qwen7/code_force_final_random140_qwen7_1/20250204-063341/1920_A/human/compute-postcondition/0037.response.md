Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be between 2 and 100.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `start` is `v`.
   - `end` is `v`.
   - `num` is a list containing `[v]`.
   - `t` is an integer from input.
   - `v` is an integer from input.
   - `t` and `v` are updated to integers from input.
   - If `end > v`, then `end` remains `v`.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop itself; it is determined before the loop starts.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still must be between 2 and 100.
   - `start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, and `v` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` is 2**
