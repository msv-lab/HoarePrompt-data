Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `start` is the minimum of the original `start` and `v`, `end` is `v` if the current value of `v` is less than 1000000000, `num` is a list containing the value of `v`, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer from input with the current value of 3, and `v` is an integer from input.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. The initial state of `num` is an empty list, so after appending `v`, `num` becomes a list containing the value of `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
