Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input**

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `t` and `v`. The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, while `t` and `v` are assigned the integer values from the input.
