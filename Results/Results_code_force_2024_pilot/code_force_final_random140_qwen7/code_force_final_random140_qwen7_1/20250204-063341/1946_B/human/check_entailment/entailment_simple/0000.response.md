Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after these operations.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If `k` is greater than the number of negative elements in the array, we can effectively "remove" all negative elements by repeatedly adding their absolute values to the array.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to the number of negative elements, we need to consider the maximum subarray sum and how to use the operations optimally.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `l`.
   - It initializes `c` to 0 and `maxi` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array `l` to find the maximum subarray sum under certain conditions.
   - It calculates the result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

4. **Formula Explanation**:
   - `2 ** k * maxi - maxi` accounts for the effect of `k` operations on the maximum subarray sum.
   - `sum(l)` is the sum of the original array.
   - The formula ensures that the sum is maximized by considering both the original array sum and the effect of the operations.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the array might contain many negative numbers, ensuring that the operations are used optimally to maximize the sum.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
