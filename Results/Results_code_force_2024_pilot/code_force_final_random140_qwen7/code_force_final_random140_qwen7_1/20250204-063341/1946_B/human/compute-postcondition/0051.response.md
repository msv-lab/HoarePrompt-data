Postcondition: `c` is either 0 or `ele` (where `ele` is an element from the list `l`), `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 2`. If an element `ele` in the list `l` is less than 0 and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, then `c` is updated to `abs(ele)`. Otherwise, `c` remains 0.
