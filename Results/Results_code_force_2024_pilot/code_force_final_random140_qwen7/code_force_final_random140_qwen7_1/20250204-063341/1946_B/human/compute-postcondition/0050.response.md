Postcondition: `c` is either `ele` (where `ele` is an element from the list `l` that is less than 0 and whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`), or 0 if no such element exists in the list `l`. `maxi` remains 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `i` is `k + 2`.
