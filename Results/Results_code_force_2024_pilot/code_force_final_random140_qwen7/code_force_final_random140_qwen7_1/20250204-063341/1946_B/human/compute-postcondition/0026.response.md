Postcondition: `ele` is the third element of `l`, `l` must have at least one element, and `c` is increased by the third element of `l` if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to `abs(ele)`, then `c` is equal to the maximum of `c` and `abs(ele)`.
