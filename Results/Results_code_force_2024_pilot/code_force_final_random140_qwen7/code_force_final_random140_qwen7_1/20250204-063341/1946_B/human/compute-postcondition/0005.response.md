Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for ele in l:`. The only object in this loop head is `ele`, which iterates over the elements of the list `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `ele`**: Since `ele` is iterating over the elements of `l`, at the start of the loop, `ele` should be set to the first element of `l`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `l`**: For the loop to execute, the list `l` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial states:
- `i` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head)
- `k` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head)
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer (relevant to the loop head)
- `c` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `maxi` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)

We need to adjust the state of `l` and `ele` for the loop to execute. Specifically:
- `ele` should be set to the first element of `l`.
- `l` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`ele` is the first element of `l`, `l` must have at least one element**
