Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 2`**.

Explanation: The code sets `c` to 0. Since `c` was either 0 or the next element from the list `l`, setting `c` to 0 does not change its original state being either 0 or the next element from the list. The value of `maxi` remains the maximum of the updated `c` (which is now 0) and the original `maxi`. The values of `l`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.
