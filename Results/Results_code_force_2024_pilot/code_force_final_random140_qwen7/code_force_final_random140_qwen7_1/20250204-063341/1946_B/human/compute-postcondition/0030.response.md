To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression in the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `c` holds the sum of all elements in the list `l` that are greater than or equal to 0, or the maximum of `c` and the absolute value of negative elements in `l` if `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of those elements.
   - `maxi` stores the highest value that `c` attains during the iterations where `c` is reset to 0 due to encountering a negative element in `l` that satisfies the condition `c <= abs(ele)`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `2 ** k * maxi`: This part multiplies `maxi` by `2 ** k`.
   - `- maxi`: This subtracts `maxi` from the result of the previous multiplication.
   - `+ sum(l)`: This adds the sum of all elements in the list `l` to the result.
   - `% 1000000007`: This takes the result modulo `1000000007`.

Given the initial state, we need to consider the possible values of `c` and `maxi` after processing the list `l`.

- If there are no negative elements in `l` that satisfy `c <= abs(ele)`, then `maxi` would be the sum of all non-negative elements in `l`.
- If there are negative elements in `l` that satisfy `c <= abs(ele)`, then `maxi` would be the highest value of `c` after resetting it due to such elements.

Without the actual list `l` and the value of `k`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `c` and `maxi`. However, we can describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007**
