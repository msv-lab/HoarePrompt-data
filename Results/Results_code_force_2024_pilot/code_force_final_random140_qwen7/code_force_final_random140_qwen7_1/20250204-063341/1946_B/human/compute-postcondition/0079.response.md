Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less than before). If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is the sum of the elements in `l`.
