To determine what will be printed, let's break down the components of the expression in the `print` statement:

1. **`maxi`**: This is the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial value of `maxi`. Since the initial value of `maxi` is not explicitly given, we need to consider the context. Typically, `maxi` would be initialized to some value, and then updated if `c` is greater than the current `maxi`.

2. **`2 ** k * maxi`**: This part calculates two raised to the power of `k`, multiplied by `maxi`.

3. **`- maxi + sum(l)`**: This subtracts `maxi` from the sum of the list `l`.

4. **`(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`**: Finally, the result of the previous calculation is taken modulo `1000000007`.

Given the initial state, we don't have explicit values for `c`, `l`, `n`, `k`, or the initial value of `maxi`. However, we can describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where maxi is the maximum value between the final value of c and the initial value of maxi, l is a list of integers, k is an input integer, and sum(l) is the sum of all elements in the list l)**
