Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `l` will be an empty list, `maxi` will hold the maximum value of `c` that satisfies the condition `ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele)` during any iteration, and `c` will be the cumulative sum of all elements in `l` that do not satisfy the condition mentioned for updating `maxi`.**

Explanation: 
- The loop processes each element in the list `l`. If an element `ele` is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, then `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `c`, and `c` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `c` accumulates the value of `ele`.
- After all elements in `l` have been processed, `l` will be empty since every element is removed from it as the loop progresses.
- `maxi` will retain the highest value of `c` that was set to 0 due to a negative element satisfying the condition `ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele)`.
- `c` will hold the sum of all elements in the original list `l` that did not trigger the condition to reset `c` to 0.
