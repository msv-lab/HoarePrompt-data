Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `c` is 0
   - `maxi` is 0
   - `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `i` is `k + 1`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for ele in l:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `l`.
   - The condition inside the loop is: if `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in the list `l`, the variable `ele` will change with each iteration.
   - The other variables (`c`, `maxi`, `l`, `n`, `k`, `i`) are not directly modified within the loop (assuming the loop body is omitted or does not modify these variables).

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ele` must be the next element in the list `l`.
   - Since `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element in the list `l` will be accessed by `i`.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `c` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop is met.
   - `maxi` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop condition.
   - `l` remains the same list of integers.
   - `n` remains the same input integer.
   - `k` remains the same input integer.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k + 2`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` becomes `k + 2`
- `ele` becomes the next element in the list `l`

Since the exact value of `ele` is not specified, we only know that it is the next element in the list.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 2`**
