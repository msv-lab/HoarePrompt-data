Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 1`. If `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `c` is either 0 or `ele` (where `ele` is an element from the list `l`), `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 2`. If an element `ele` in the list `l` is less than 0 and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, then `c` is updated to `abs(ele)`. Otherwise, `c` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is either 0 or the next element from the list `l`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 2`. If `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, then `c` is updated to `abs(ele)`. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
