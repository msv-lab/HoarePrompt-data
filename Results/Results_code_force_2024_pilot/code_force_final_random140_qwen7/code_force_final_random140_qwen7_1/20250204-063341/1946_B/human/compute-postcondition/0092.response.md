Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2⋅10^5) such that the sum of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5, and an array a of n integers (−10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns information based on the values of n, k, and the array a.**

This means the function takes a set of test cases as implicit input, each containing t, n, k, and an array a, and processes these to produce an output for each test case based on the given conditions.
