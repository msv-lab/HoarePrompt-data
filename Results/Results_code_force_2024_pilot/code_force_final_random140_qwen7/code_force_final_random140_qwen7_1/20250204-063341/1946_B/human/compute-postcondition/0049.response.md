Output State: **`c` is `ele`, `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 2`**.

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. Since `ele` is not defined in the initial state, it remains as `ele` in the output state. The other variables (`maxi`, `l`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.
