Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `l` will be an empty list since it loses one element in each iteration until it is exhausted. `maxi` will hold the highest value of `c` that was reset to 0 when a negative element `ele` in `l` satisfied the condition `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`. If no such condition was met throughout the iterations, `maxi` will be the final value of `c` after processing all elements in `l`. The variable `c` will be 0 because it is reset to 0 whenever the condition `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)` is met. The variables `i`, `k`, and `n` will retain their values from the initial state, and `ele` will be the last element of `l` that was processed, which does not affect the final output state as `c` and `maxi` are already determined.
