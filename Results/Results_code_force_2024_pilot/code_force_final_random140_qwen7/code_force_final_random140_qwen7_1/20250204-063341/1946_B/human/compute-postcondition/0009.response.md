Output State: **`ele` is the first element of `l`, `l` must have at least one element, and the value of `ele` is less than 0, `c` is 0, and the current value of `c` being less than or equal to the maximum of `maxi` and `c`.**

Explanation: The code sets `c` to 0. The initial conditions for `ele`, `l`, and `c` relative to `maxi` remain unchanged, except that now `c` is explicitly set to 0.
