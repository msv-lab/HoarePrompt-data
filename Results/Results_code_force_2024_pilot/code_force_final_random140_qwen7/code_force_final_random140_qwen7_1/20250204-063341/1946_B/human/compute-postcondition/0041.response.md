Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `c = 0` simply reassigns the value of `c` to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state. All other variables (`maxi`, `l`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
