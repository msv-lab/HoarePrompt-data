Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `c` is 0**.

The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. All other variables retain their initial states.
