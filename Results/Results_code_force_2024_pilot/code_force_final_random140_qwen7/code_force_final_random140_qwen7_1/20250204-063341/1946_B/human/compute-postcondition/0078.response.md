Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less than before); `c` is the sum of the elements in `l`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the variable `c` by the value of `ele`, which is an element from the list `l`. Since `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, and one element is removed (as mentioned in the initial state), `c` now holds the sum of the remaining elements in `l`.
