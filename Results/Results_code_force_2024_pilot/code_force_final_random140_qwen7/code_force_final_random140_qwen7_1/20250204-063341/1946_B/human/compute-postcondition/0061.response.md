Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial value of `maxi`, `l` is the list of integers as provided, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the input integer, and `i` is `k + n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `maxi`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `i` is updated to `k + n + 1`.
