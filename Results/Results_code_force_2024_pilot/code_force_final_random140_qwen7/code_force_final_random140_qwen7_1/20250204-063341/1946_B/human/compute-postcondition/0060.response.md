Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < int(input())`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial value of `maxi`.
   - `l` is the list of integers as provided.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `k` is the input integer.
   - `i` is `k + n`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + n + 1`.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains the same for the duration of the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `maxi` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `l` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` changes to `k + n + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`maxi` is the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial value of `maxi`, `l` is the list of integers as provided, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, and `i` is `k + n + 1`**.
