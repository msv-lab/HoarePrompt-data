Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for ele in l:`. The objects involved here are `ele`, `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `l` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `ele` is the variable used to iterate over each element in the list `l`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `l`. 

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `ele` is a temporary variable used inside the loop, its initial value is not relevant for the loop to start. It will take on the values of the elements in `l` during each iteration.
   - The list `l` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `l` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 1`**
