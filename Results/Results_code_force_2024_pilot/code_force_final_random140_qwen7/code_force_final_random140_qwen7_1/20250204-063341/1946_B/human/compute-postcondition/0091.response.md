Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `maxi` will hold the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial value of `maxi` for each test case. The variable `c` will be reset to 0 whenever a negative element in the list `l` is encountered that satisfies the condition `c <= abs(ele)`. The variable `sum(l)` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`. The variable `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)` will be calculated for each test case, and the result will be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The variables `n`, `k`, and `i` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `maxi` will contain the highest value of `c` that meets the specified conditions across all test cases. The expression `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)` will be computed for each test case, and the results will be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
