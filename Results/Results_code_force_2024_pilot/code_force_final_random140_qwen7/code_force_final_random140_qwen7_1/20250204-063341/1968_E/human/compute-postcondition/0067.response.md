Output State: `n` must be greater than 5, `i` is `n-2`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `n-2`. After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-2`. For the loop to run at least `n-2` times (since it starts from 1), `n` must be greater than `5` (as seen from the previous output states).
