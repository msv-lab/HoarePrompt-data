Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\). This means `t` can take any integer value between 1 and 50 inclusive.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 4. This means `n` is an integer with a minimum value of 4.
- `j` is 5.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

This code will concatenate the string representation of `j` with itself and print it. Since `j` is explicitly given as 5, the output will be "5 5".

Output: **5 5**
