Output State: **The loop will execute `n - 3` times, printing each value of `i` starting from 3 up to `n + 1`. The final value of `i` will be `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have the value `n + 1`, assuming the loop runs its full course without any interruptions or changes to `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 3 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. Therefore, if the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`, and `n` must be at least 6 for the loop to run for at least 3 iterations as specified.
