Output State: The value of `i` will be `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n + 2`. The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range from 3 to `n + 2` (inclusive). Once `i` exceeds `n + 2`, the loop terminates. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be `n + 2`, assuming the loop ran until it could no longer increment `i` within its defined range.
