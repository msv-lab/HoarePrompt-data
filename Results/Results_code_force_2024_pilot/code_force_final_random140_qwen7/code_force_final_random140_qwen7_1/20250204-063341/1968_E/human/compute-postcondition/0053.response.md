Output State: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 8.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 4` to `n`, incrementing `j` by 1 each time. After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n + 1`. Since the loop prints `j` starting from 4 up to `n`, if it executes 3 times, `j` is 5, meaning `n` must be at least 4. For the loop to execute all its iterations, `n` must be large enough so that the loop runs until its final condition is met. If the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be `n + 1`, which means `n` must be at least 8 (since the loop starts at 4 and increments by 1 each iteration). Therefore, the final state of `n` must be at least 8.
