State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `3 <= i < n + 2` must be true.
3. Initially, `i` is set to `n`.
4. To satisfy the loop condition, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 because if `n` is less than 3, `i` (which is `n`) would not meet the lower bound of 3 in the `range` function.
5. The value of `i` itself does not need to be adjusted as it is already set to `n` and will be incremented within the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
