Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: The initial state is that `i` is `n` and `n` must be greater than or equal to 6. The code snippet updates `n` to the integer value of the input provided by the user. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the input operation. Therefore, the output state is that `i` is `n`, and `n` is the integer value of the input provided.
