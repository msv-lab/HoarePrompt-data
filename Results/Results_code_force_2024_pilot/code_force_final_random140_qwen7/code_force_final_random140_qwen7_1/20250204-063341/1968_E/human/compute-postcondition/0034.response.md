Output State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an input integer greater than 8.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = n + 1`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `i` reaches its final value of `n + 2`. The condition for the loop to run is that `n` must be greater than 8, as seen from the output state after 3 iterations where `i` is 5, implying `n` is at least 8. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be `n + 2`, with `n` being an input integer greater than 8.
