Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each test case, it returns either an integer `t` or a string indicating the result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers `t` and `n`. However, since the function definition does not explicitly mention these parameters, it is inferred that the function processes these values internally for each test case and returns a result accordingly.
