Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `3` to `n + 1` (inclusive) because `range(3, n + 2)` generates numbers starting from 3 up to but not including `n + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 2`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than `n + 3` (though this condition is logically impossible, we will consider it as given).

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The condition `n > n + 3` is logically impossible, but since we need to adjust the state based on the loop logic, we will assume `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is an input integer greater than `n + 3`**
