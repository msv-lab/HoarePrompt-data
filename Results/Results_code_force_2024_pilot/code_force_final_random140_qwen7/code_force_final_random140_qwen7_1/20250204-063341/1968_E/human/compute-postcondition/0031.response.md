Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` is an input integer greater than `n + 3`

2. **Understand the for loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 3 to `n + 2` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`.

4. **Analyze the current value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.

5. **Check if the loop can continue:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 2`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 4, the loop can continue as long as `n + 2` is greater than 4.
   - Since `n` is an input integer greater than `n + 3`, it implies that `n` is actually greater than some large number, but for the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy the condition `n > 4 + 2 = 6`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 5.
   - `n` must remain the same and still satisfy the condition `n > 6`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 5, `n` is an input integer greater than 6**
