Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 4.
- `j` is `n`.

The `print` statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.

Since `j` is equal to `n` and `n` must be at least 4, `j` will be at least 4. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact number to be printed. But we know it will be a string representation of `j` concatenated with itself.

Output: **"4 4" (or any number at least 4 concatenated with itself)**
