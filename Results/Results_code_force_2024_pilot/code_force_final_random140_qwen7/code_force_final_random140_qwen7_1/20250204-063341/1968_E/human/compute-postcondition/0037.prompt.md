Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(1, 1)
    print(1, 2)
    for i in range(3, n + 2):
        print(i, i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will execute `n - 3` times, printing each value of `i` starting from 3 up to `n + 1`. The final value of `i` will be `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The value of `i` will be `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have the value of `n + 2`. The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range from 3 to `n + 2`. Once `i` exceeds `n + 2`, the loop terminates. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be `n + 2`, assuming the loop runs until its maximum iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an input integer greater than 8.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = n + 1`. Since the loop has executed 3 times, `i` has incremented by 2 each time, starting from 3. Therefore, after `n + 2` iterations (which is the total number of iterations since `i` starts at 3 and goes up to `n + 1`), `i` will be `n + 2`. The value of `n` must be greater than 8 for the loop to run 3 times as described in the given states.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
