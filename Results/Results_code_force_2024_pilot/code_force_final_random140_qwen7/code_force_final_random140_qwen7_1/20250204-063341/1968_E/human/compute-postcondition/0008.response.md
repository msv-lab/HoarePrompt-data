Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(3, n + 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n + 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented within the loop (though not shown explicitly in the example), we assume it follows the typical behavior of incrementing by 1. Therefore, if `i` was 5, after the next iteration, `i` will be 6.

4. **Determine the new value of `n`**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 2`. Given that `i` becomes 6, `n` must still satisfy the condition `6 < n + 2`. Simplifying this, we get `4 < n`, or `n > 4`. Since `n` must already be greater than or equal to 6, it remains true that `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `i` and the unchanged condition for `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6**
