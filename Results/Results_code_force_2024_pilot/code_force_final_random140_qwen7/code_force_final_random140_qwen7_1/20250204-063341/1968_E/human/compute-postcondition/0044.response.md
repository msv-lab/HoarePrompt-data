The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'1 2'`.

Since the values of `t` and `n` do not affect the output of the `print` statement, the output will be exactly as specified in the statement itself.

Output: **'1 2'**
