Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves two integers: `t` (1 <= t <= 50) and `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3). For each test case, it prints the value of `n` twice, followed by `n-1`, and then prints numbers from 1 to `n-2`. If `n` equals 3, it additionally prints 2 and 1. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.**
