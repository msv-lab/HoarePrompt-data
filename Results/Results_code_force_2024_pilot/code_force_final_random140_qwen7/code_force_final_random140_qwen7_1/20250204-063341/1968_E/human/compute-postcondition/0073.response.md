Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and -2 (inclusive), which effectively means `t` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 5 with `i` being `n-2`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed three times as specified, `t` would have been decremented by 3 each time, resulting in `t` becoming 0. The variable `n` must be greater than 5 because it needs to go through the for-loop twice (from 1 to `n-2`) after the if-else block has run once, ensuring `n > 3` and thus `n > 5` after three iterations. The variable `i` is set to `n-2` at the end of the last iteration's for-loop.
