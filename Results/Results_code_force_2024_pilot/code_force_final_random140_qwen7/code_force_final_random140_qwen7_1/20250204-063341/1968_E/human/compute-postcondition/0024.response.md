Output State: **`i` is `n + 3`, `n` is an input integer greater than `n + 3`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. According to the precondition, `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 3`, but since `n` is now assigned the value of `int(input())`, `n` is indeed greater than `n + 3`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `n + 3`.
