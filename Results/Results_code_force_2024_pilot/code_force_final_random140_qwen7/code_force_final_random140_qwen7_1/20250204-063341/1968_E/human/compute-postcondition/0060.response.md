Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case has two integers: t and n. For each test case, if t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50 and n is an integer within the range of 2 to 10^3, the function processes these values but does not explicitly return anything from the given information.**

However, since the problem statement does not specify the exact output for each test case, we can only describe the input constraints and expected behavior regarding the parameters t and n.
