Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and its range as `range(4, n + 1)`. This means `j` will iterate from 4 to `n` inclusive.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 4.
   - `j` is `n`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be within the range specified by `range(4, n + 1)`. This means `j` must be between 4 and `n` (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to the next value in the range, which is 5 if `n` is 5 or higher.
   - `i` remains unchanged at 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 4.
- `j` is 5 (assuming `n` is at least 5; if `n` is exactly 4, then `j` would be 5 immediately).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 5**
