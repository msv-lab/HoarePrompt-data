Based on the initial state provided:

```python
print(i, i)
```

The code snippet simply prints the value of the variable `i` twice. Since no explicit value for `i` is given in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i`. However, we know that `i` is being printed twice.

Output: **i, i**
