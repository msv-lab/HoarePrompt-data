Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is equal to `n`.
2. It also states that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
3. Therefore, `i` must also be greater than or equal to 3.
4. The print statement `print(i, i)` will print the value of `i` twice.

Given the above steps, the output will be the value of `i` printed twice.

Output: **i i (where i is the value of n, which is greater than or equal to 3)**
