Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 50) and an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^3). For each test case, it performs some operation based on the values of t and n, but the specific operation is not detailed here. The function returns a result for each test case, which could be a value, a string, or a collection of values, depending on the operation performed.**
