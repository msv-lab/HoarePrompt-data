Output State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an input integer greater than 8.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = n + 1`. Since the loop has executed 3 times, `i` has incremented by 2 each time, starting from 3. Therefore, after `n + 2` iterations (which is the total number of iterations since `i` starts at 3 and goes up to `n + 1`), `i` will be `n + 2`. The value of `n` must be greater than 8 for the loop to run 3 times as described in the given states.
