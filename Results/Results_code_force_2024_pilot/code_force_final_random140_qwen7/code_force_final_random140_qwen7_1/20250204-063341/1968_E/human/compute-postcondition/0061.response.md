Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each test case, it prints specific pairs of integers based on the value of \( n \). If \( n \) is 3, it prints "2 3". If \( n \) is at least 4, it prints "2 4" followed by pairs of integers from 4 to \( n \). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
