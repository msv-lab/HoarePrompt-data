The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each test case, it prints a sequence of pairs of integers. Specifically, it prints (1, 1), (1, 2), followed by pairs (i, i) for `i` ranging from 3 to `n + 1`. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value but outputs the generated sequence of pairs.
