### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - The program should output \( n \) points that achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The function `func()` takes input for the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - It prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - Then, it iterates from 3 to \( n + 2 \) and prints coordinates of the form \((i, i)\).

3. **Checking the Output for Different Values of \( n \)**:
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - The output will be:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1\}\). This is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - The output will be:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). This is correct.
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - The output will be:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\). This is correct.
   - For \( n = 5 \):
     - The output will be:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\). This is correct.
   - For \( n = 6 \):
     - The output will be:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       7 7
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). This is correct.

However, the program does not actually maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for all \( n \). Let's consider a few more examples:

   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\). However, the maximum possible distinct Manhattan distances for \( n = 4 \) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). A better arrangement would be:
       ```
       1 1
       1 3
       4 1
       4 4
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

   - For \( n = 5 \):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). However, the maximum possible distinct Manhattan distances for \( n = 5 \) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\). A better arrangement would be:
       ```
       1 1
       1 3
       3 1
       5 1
       5 5
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not always produce the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances. Therefore, it is not a correct solution for the problem.
