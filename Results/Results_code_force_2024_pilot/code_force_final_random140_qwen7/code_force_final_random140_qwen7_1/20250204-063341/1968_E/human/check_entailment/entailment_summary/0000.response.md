Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze whether the provided solution meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Output Format**: For each test case, the program prints pairs of coordinates `(x_i, y_i)` in the grid. Specifically, it prints:
   - `(1, 1)`
   - `(1, 2)`
   - Pairs `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n + 1`.

3. **Manhattan Distance Calculation**:
   - The Manhattan distance between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` is `1`.
   - The Manhattan distance between `(1, 1)` and `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n + 1` will be `i - 1`.
   - The Manhattan distance between `(1, 2)` and `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n + 1` will be `i - 1 + |2 - i|`.

4. **Distinct Distances**:
   - The distances include `1`, `2`, `3`, ..., up to `n`.
   - This ensures that the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) contains all values from `1` to `n`, thus maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly generates a set of points that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
