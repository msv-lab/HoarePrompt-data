Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the program only prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2) for the first two lines and then prints points (i, i) for the rest, which does not necessarily maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, for \(n=3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
4 4
```
This does not produce the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\). The correct output should include points like (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1) as shown in the note section.

A corrected version of the program would need to strategically place points to maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances.
