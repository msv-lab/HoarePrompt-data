Output State: **`i` is 1; `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` to its current value; `beg` is equal to `a_map[a[0]]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` to its current value. Since `i` was initially 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. The variable `beg` remains unchanged and is still equal to `a_map[a[0]]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
