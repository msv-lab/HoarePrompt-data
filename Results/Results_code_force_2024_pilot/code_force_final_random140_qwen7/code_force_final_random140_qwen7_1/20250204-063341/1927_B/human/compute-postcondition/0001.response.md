Output State: **`a_map` is a dictionary where each key from 0 to n-1 maps to the value 0, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` represents the number of previous indices with the same character as the current index; `sam` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'.**

Explanation: The code creates a dictionary `a_map` where each key from 0 to `n-1` maps to the value 0. The initial values of `n`, `a`, and `sam` remain unchanged.
