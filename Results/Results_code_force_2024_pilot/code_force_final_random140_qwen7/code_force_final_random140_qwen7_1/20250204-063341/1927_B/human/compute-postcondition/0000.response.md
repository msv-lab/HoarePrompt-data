Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` represents the number of previous indices with the same character as the current index; `sam` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'**.

Explanation: The code only initializes the string `sam`. It does not affect the values of `n` or the list `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
