Output State: **`i` is 3, `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` to its current value, `beg` is equal to `a_map[a[0]] + 1`, `a_map[a[2]]` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` to its current value. Since `i` was initially 2, after executing the line `res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]`, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The other variables (`res`, `beg`, and `a_map[a[2]]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
