You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where each element a_i represents the number of previous indices with the same character as the current index.
def func_1(n, a):
    sam = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
    a_map = {x: (0) for x in range(n)}
    res = ''
    for i in range(n):
        beg = a_map[a[i]]
        
        res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]
        
        a_map[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `res` will be a string constructed by adding `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for each iteration, `a_map` will map each key from 0 to n-1 to its final value which is the number of times it was incremented during the loop, and `a` and `sam` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.
    #
    #In more detail, `res` will contain characters from the string 'sam' based on the modulo operation with 27, and the length of `res` will be equal to `n`. Each character in `a_map` will reflect the total count of occurrences of the corresponding index in the list `a` throughout the loop's iterations.
    return res
    #The program returns a string `res` constructed by iterating over the range of `n`, where for each index `i`, the character `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` is appended to `res`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. For each index `i` in the range of `n`, the function appends the character `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` to the result string `res`. Finally, the function returns the constructed string `res`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `res` constructed by iterating over the range of `n`, where for each index `i`, the character `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` is appended to `res`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
