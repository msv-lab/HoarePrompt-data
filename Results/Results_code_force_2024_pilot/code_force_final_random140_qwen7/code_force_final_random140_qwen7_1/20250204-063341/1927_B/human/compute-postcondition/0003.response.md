Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` should start at 0 because the `range(n)` function generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `n` is already given as a positive integer representing the length of the string.

3. **Check if the loop can execute based on the given conditions**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and `range(n)` will generate values from 0 to `n-1`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1 (which is already given).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` needs to be set to 0.
   - `n` is already known to be a positive integer, so no adjustment is needed for this.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
