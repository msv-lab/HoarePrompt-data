Output State: **`i` is 4, `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` to its current value, `beg` is equal to `a_map[a[0]] + 1`, `a_map[a[2]]` is increased by 1, `a_map[a[i]]` is increased by 1, `beg` is now equal to `a_map[a[i]]`, `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` to its current value, `a_map[a[i]]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a_map[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `a_map[a[i]]` by 1. Since `i` is 4, this line of code specifically targets `a_map[a[4]]`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `a[4]`, only `a[0]` and `a[2]`. Therefore, the value of `a_map[a[4]]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
