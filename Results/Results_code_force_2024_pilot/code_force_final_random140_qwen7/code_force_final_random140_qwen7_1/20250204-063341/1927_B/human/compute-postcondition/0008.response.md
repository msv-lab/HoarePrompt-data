Output State: **`i` is 2, `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` to its current value, `beg` is equal to `a_map[a[0]] + 1`, `a_map[a[2]]` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `beg = a_map[a[i]]` updates the variable `beg` to the value of `a_map[a[i]]`. Given that `i` is 2 initially, the code effectively sets `beg` to `a_map[a[2]]`. Since `a_map[a[0]]` was previously set as `beg`, `beg` is now incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
