Output State: **`i` is 4, `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` to its current value, `beg` is equal to `a_map[a[0]] + 1`, `a_map[a[2]]` is increased by 1, `a_map[a[i]]` is increased by 1, `beg` is now equal to `a_map[a[i]]`, `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` to its current value. Since `i` is 4, the line of code refers to `a[4]`. However, the exact value of `a[4]` is not provided, so we keep it as `a[i]`. Similarly, `a_map[a[0]]` and `a_map[a[i]]` are used to update `beg`. The value of `res` is updated twice, once for `a[0]` and once for `a[4]`.
