Output State: **The program returns a string `res` constructed by iterating over the range of `n`, where for each index `i`, the character `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` is appended to `res`.**

This means that the string `res` is built by taking the modulo 27 of the value in `a_map` corresponding to the element `a[i]` for each index `i` in the range of `n`, and then using that result as an index into the string `sam` to get the character to append to `res`. The length of `res` will be exactly `n`.
