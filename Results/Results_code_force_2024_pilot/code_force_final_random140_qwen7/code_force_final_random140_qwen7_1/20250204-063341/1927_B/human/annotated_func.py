#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where each element a_i represents the number of previous indices with the same character as the current index.
def func_1(n, a):
    sam = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
    a_map = {x: (0) for x in range(n)}
    res = ''
    for i in range(n):
        beg = a_map[a[i]]
        
        res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]
        
        a_map[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `res` will be a string constructed by adding `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for each iteration, `a_map` will map each key from 0 to n-1 to its final value which is the number of times it was incremented during the loop, and `a` and `sam` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.
    #
    #In more detail, `res` will contain characters from the string 'sam' based on the modulo operation with 27, and the length of `res` will be equal to `n`. Each character in `a_map` will reflect the total count of occurrences of the corresponding index in the list `a` throughout the loop's iterations.
    return res
    #The program returns a string `res` constructed by iterating over the range of `n`, where for each index `i`, the character `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` is appended to `res`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. It constructs and returns a string `res` by iterating over the range of `n`, where for each index `i`, the character `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` is appended to `res`. The function also updates a dictionary `a_map` to keep track of the count of occurrences of each index in the list `a` throughout the loop's iterations. The final state of the program includes the constructed string `res` and the updated dictionary `a_map`, while the original lists `a` and the string `sam` remain unchanged.
