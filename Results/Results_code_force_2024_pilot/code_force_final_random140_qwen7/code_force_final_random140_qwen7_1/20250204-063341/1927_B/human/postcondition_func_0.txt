The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. It constructs and returns a string `res` by iterating over the range of `n`, where for each index `i`, the character `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` is appended to `res`. The function also updates a dictionary `a_map` to keep track of the count of occurrences of each index in the list `a` throughout the loop's iterations. The final state of the program includes the constructed string `res` and the updated dictionary `a_map`, while the original lists `a` and the string `sam` remain unchanged.
