Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed:

1. **Input Handling**: The program asks for the number of entries and then takes multiple inputs, but it does not handle the inputs as specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem states that each test case will be on a separate line, and the program should process each test case individually.

2. **Finding \( y \)**: The program attempts to find a value of \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. However, the approach used is incorrect. It tries to find a divisor of \( x \) and calculates \( y \) as \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \), which does not necessarily maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

3. **Output**: The program prints the results separated by spaces, whereas the problem requires the results to be printed each on a new line.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Read each test case separately.
- For each \( x \), find the maximum \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
- Ensure the output is formatted correctly with each result on a new line.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def find_max_y(x):
    max_y = 0
    for y in range(1, x):
        current_gcd = gcd(x, y)
        if current_gcd + y > max_y:
            max_y = current_gcd + y
            best_y = y
    return best_y

def main():
    num_test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(num_test_cases):
        x = int(input())
        print(find_max_y(x))

main()
```

This program correctly reads the number of test cases and each test case's value of \( x \). It then finds the maximum \( y \) for each \( x \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized and prints the result for each test case on a new line.
