Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num` and then reads `num` integers from the input.
   - This part of the program correctly handles the input according to the problem statement.

2. **Finding the Result:**
   - The program attempts to find a value `y` such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - It does this by iterating over all numbers from 2 to \(x\) and checking if they are divisors of \(x\).
   - If a divisor is found, it calculates \(y\) as \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) and appends it to the result list `res`.
   - However, the calculation of \(y\) is not correct for maximizing \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

3. **Maximizing \(\gcd(x, y) + y\):**
   - To maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), we need to consider the properties of the greatest common divisor.
   - The optimal \(y\) should be chosen such that \(\gcd(x, y)\) is maximized while keeping \(y < x\).
   - A better approach would be to start from \(y = x - 1\) and decrement \(y\) until a valid \(\gcd(x, y)\) is found.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We can start from \(y = x - 1\) and check if \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized, we can stop and return \(y\).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    res = []
    for _ in range(num):
        x = int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(_) + '- '))
        max_value = -1
        best_y = -1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_value = gcd(x, y)
            if gcd_value + y > max_value:
                max_value = gcd_value + y
                best_y = y
        res.append(best_y)
    print(*res, sep='\n')

from math import gcd
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly find the value of \(y\) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
