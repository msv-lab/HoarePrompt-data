Output State: **`i` is `num - 1`, `res` contains an additional element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `j` is `current_j + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `res`, and `j`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
