Output State: **`i` is `num - 1`, `res` contains one element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `L1[i] % j` equals 0**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `res` the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Given the initial state, `L1[i]` is a positive integer and divisible by `j`, meaning `L1[i] % j` equals 0. After executing the code, `res` will contain the calculated value, and `i` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
