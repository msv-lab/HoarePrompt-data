Postcondition: `i` is `num - 1`, `res` contains an additional element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and `j` is `current_j + 2`. This is because if `L1[i] % j == 0`, then `res` is updated with the new element, and the loop or statement is broken. If the condition `L1[i] % j == 0` is not met, then no changes are made to `res` and `j`.
