Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` is an input integer, `L1` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are integers entered by the user and the third element is an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code appends an integer entered by the user (using `int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))` to the list `L1`. Since `i` is initially 4, `i + 1` evaluates to 5, so the user is prompted to enter the fifth element. This new element is appended to `L1`, increasing its length from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
