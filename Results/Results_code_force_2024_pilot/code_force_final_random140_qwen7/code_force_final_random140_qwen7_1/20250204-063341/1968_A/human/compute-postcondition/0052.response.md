Output State: **`i` is `num`, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is divisible by `j`, `res` contains the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the loop or conditional statement being executed has been broken out of, but the values of `i`, `L1[i]`, `j`, and `res` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
