Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer, `L1` is a list containing one element which is an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `num` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code appends an integer input by the user to the list `L1`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions or constraints.
