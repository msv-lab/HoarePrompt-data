Output State: **`i` is `num - 1`; `res` contains the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `j` is `current_j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block indicated, the `break` statement simply indicates that we exit the current context. The values of `i`, `res`, and `j` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables.
