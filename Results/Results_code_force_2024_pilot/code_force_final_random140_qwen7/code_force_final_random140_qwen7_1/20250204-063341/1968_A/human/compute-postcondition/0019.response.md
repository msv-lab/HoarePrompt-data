Output State: **`res` has a new element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `i` and `j` retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `res`. This new element is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged from their previous states, and `res` now includes this new element.
