Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j`, which ranges from `2` to `L1[i] + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
   - `num` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `num`.
   - `L1[num]` is a positive integer such that `L1[num] + 1 >= 2`.

3. **Understand the loop body**: The loop body checks if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`. If it is, then `res` is updated with the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `x`, `num`, `i`, and `L1[num]` remain unchanged.

4. **Determine the state adjustments for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j` from `2` to `L1[i] + 1`, the only variable that changes within the loop is `j`.
   - The values of `t`, `x`, `num`, `i`, and `L1[num]` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

5. **Calculate the new value of `j` for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been the last value it was set to before the loop condition failed or completed its full range.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- `t` remains the same: a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` remains the same: an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
- `num` remains the same: greater than 0.
- `i` remains the same: equal to `num`.
- `L1[num]` remains the same: a positive integer such that `L1[num] + 1 >= 2`.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Since the exact previous value of `j` is not specified, we can denote it as `j_prev`. Thus, the next value of `j` would be `j_prev + 1`.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1[num]` is a positive integer such that `L1[num] + 1 >= 2`, `j` is `j_prev + 1`**.
