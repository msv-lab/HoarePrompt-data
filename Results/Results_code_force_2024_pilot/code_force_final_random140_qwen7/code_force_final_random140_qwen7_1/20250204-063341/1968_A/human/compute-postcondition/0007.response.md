Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < num`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\)
   - `num` is an input integer
   - `L1` is a list containing two elements (the first element is an integer entered by the user, the second element is an integer entered by the user)
   - `res` is an empty list
   - `i` is 3

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - The value of `num` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains the same: \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `x` remains the same: \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\)
   - `num` remains the same: it is an input integer
   - `L1` remains the same: a list containing two elements (the first element is an integer entered by the user, the second element is an integer entered by the user)
   - `res` remains the same: an empty list
   - `i` is updated to 4

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` is an input integer, `L1` is a list containing two elements (the first element is an integer entered by the user, the second element is an integer entered by the user), `res` is an empty list, `i` is 4**
