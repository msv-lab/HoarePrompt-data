Postcondition: `i` is `num - 1`, `res` contains the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and `j` is `current_j + 1`. If `L1[i] % j == 0`, then `res` is updated to `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur if the condition `L1[i] % j != 0`.
