Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` is an input integer, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `num`, and `num` must be greater than 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each of which is an integer input by the user. The variable `i` will be equal to `num` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `num`. The variables `t` and `x` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop. The list `res` remains empty since no operations were performed on it within the loop.
