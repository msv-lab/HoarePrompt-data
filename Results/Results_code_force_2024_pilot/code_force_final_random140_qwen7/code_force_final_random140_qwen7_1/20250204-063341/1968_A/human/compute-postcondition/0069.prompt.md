You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` is an input integer, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `num`, and `num` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each of which is an integer input by the user. The variable `i` will be equal to `num` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `num`. The variables `t` and `x` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop. The list `res` remains empty since no operations were performed on it within the loop.
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` contains exactly `num` elements, each of which is an integer input by the user, and `res` is a list containing the results of the operations performed within the loop for each iteration.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: the elements of res, each on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000). For each test case, it processes these values and returns a result based on their relationship or some specified condition.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
