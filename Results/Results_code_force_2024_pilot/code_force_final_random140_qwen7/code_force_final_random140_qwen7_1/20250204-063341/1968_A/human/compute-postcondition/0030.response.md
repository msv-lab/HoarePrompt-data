Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables that are being used within the loop. In this case, the loop head includes the variable `j`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` taking the value 2 (as specified in the `range(2, L1[i] + 1)`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `L1[i] + 1`. Therefore, the initial value of `j` should be 2, and `L1[i]` must be a positive integer.

4. **Check the Given States**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
   - `num` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `num - 1`.
   - `L1[num]` is a positive integer.
   - `res` contains multiple elements.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is defined as `num - 1`, and `num` is greater than 0, `i` must be a valid index for `L1`.
   - `L1[i]` must be a positive integer for the loop to start with `j = 2` and continue until `j` reaches `L1[i] + 1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` must be a valid index for `L1` (which means `num - 1` is a valid index).
- `L1[i]` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `num - 1`, `L1[i]` must be a positive integer**
