Output State: **`i` is `num - 1`, `res` contains an additional element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `j` is `current_j + 2`**.

Explanation: The code appends to the list `res` the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Here, `i` is `num - 1`, and `j` is `current_j + 2`. The value of `res` is updated by including this new element, while `i` and `j` retain their respective values from before the operation.
