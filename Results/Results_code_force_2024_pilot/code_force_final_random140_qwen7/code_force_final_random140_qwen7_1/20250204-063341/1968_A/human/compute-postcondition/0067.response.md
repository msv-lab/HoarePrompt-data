Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
- `num` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `num`.
- `L1` contains exactly `num` elements, each of which is an integer input by the user.
- `res` is a list containing the results of the operations performed within the loop for each iteration.

The `print(*res, sep='\n')` statement will print the elements of the `res` list, each on a new line due to the `sep='\n'` parameter.

Since the exact values of the elements in `res` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of the operations performed during the loop. However, without knowing the specific operations, we can only say that `res` contains the results of those operations.

Output: **the elements of res, each on a new line**
