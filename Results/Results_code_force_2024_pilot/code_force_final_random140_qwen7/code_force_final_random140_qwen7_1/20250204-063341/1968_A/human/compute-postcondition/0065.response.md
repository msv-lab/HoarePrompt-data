Output State: **After all iterations, `i` is still `num`, `L1[i]` is reduced to its smallest prime factor (or remains as 1 if it was 1 initially), and `res` contains all values calculated from `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for each valid `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i]` until the condition `L1[i] % j == 0` is met.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` remains unchanged as `num`. The value of `L1[i]` is either reduced to its smallest prime factor (if it was composite) or remains 1 if it was 1 initially. The list `res` will contain multiple elements, each being the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for every `j` from 2 up to `L1[i]` where `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, with the loop breaking out once the condition is satisfied.
