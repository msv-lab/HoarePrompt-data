Output State: **`i` is `num`, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is divisible by `j`, `j` is `L1[i] + 2`, and `res` contains two additional elements which are `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the operations on `i`, `L1[i]`, `j`, and `res` were being performed. The values of `i`, `L1[i]`, `j`, and the elements added to `res` remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.
