Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(num)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\)
   - `num` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is equal to `num`
   - `L1[num]` is a positive integer
   - `res` contains multiple elements, specifically the results of the operations performed within the loop

3. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `num-1`. For each `i`, the loop body is omitted, but we know that `i` starts at `num` in the previous iteration and will decrease by 1 in each subsequent iteration until it reaches `0`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: Since `i` starts at `num` in the previous iteration and decreases by 1 in each subsequent iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `num - 1`.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: The values of `t`, `x`, `num`, `L1[num]`, and `res` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num - 1`, `L1[num]` is a positive integer, and `res` contains multiple elements**.
