Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `L1[i]`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(2, L1[i] + 1)`. This means `j` must be less than `L1[i] + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `res` contains a new element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`.
   - `i` retains its previous value.
   - `j` retains its previous value.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was part of the loop and it incremented in the loop body, the next value of `j` should be `j + 1`.
   - `L1[i]` remains unchanged because it is an external variable not modified within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `res` will still contain the same elements as before plus the newly added element from the previous iteration.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `L1[i]` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`res` contains a new element which is `L1[i] // (j + 1) * ((j + 1) - 1)`, `i` retains its previous value, `j` is incremented by 1, and `L1[i]` remains the same**.
