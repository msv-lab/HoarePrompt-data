Postcondition: `i` is `num`, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is divisible by `j`, `j` is `L1[i] + 2`, and `res` contains two additional elements which are `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. This is because if `L1[i] % j == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, ensuring that `res` has two additional elements. If the condition `L1[i] % j == 0` is not met, `res` remains unchanged with only one additional element as per the original precondition.
