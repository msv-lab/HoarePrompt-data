Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` remains as `num - 1`.
   - `L1[i]` is a positive integer.
   - `res` contains multiple elements which are the results of the operation `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for each `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i] + 1` where `L1[i] % j == 0`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(num):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `i` is currently `num - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `num - 1 + 1 = num`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be updated to `num`.
   - `L1[i]` will be `L1[num]` because `i` will point to the `num`-th element of `L1`.
   - `res` will be recalculated based on the new value of `L1[num]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `num`.
- `L1[i]` is `L1[num]`.
- `res` will be recalculated based on `L1[num]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `num`, `L1[i]` is `L1[num]`, and `res` will be recalculated based on `L1[num]`**.
