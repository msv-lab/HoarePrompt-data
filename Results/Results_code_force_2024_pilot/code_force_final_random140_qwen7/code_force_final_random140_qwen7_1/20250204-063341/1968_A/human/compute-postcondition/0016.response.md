Output State: **`res` contains the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)', `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1[num]` is a positive integer such that `L1[num] + 1 >= 2`, and the current value of `L1[i]` is divisible by `j', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement.
