Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1[num]` is a positive integer such that `L1[num] + 1 >= 2`. If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` contains the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `x`, `num`, `i`, and `L1[num]` remain unchanged.**
