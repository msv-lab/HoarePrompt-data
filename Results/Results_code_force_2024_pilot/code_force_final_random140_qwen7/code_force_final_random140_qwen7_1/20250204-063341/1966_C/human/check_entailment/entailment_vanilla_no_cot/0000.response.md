Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Set Usage**: The use of a set to store unique values from the array `arr` is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem. The set operation does not preserve the order of elements, which is important for determining the optimal moves.

2. **Game Logic**: The logic to determine the winner based on the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted unique array is flawed. The correct approach involves using the XOR operation on the unique values after sorting them.

3. **Optimal Play**: The game is a variant of the Nim game, and the winning strategy depends on the XOR of the sizes of the piles. If the XOR of all pile sizes is zero, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Sort the array
        arr.sort()
        xor_sum = 0
        for pile in arr:
            xor_sum ^= pile
        if xor_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version correctly implements the game logic and should produce the expected results based on the problem description.
