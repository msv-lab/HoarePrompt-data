Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` remains the same (an input integer), `s` is a list containing all unique elements from the list `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(s)` converts the set `s` into a list. Since `s` originally contained all unique elements from the list `arr`, converting it to a list retains these unique elements but changes the data structure from a set to a list. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
