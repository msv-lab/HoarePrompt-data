Output State: **`ans` is either 1 or 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `ans`, `i`, `n`, or `s`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
