Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set `s`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `n` being an input integer and `arr` being a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, while adding that `s` is now an empty set.
