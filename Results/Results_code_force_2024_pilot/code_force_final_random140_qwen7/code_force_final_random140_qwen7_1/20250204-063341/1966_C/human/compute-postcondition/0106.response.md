Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n`, the first iteration will not occur because `i` is already equal to `n` and the loop condition `i < n` will be false.
   - Therefore, to make the loop execute at least once, `i` should be one less than `n`, i.e., `i = n - 1`.

5. **Final state after adjustment**:
   - `i` should be `n - 1` to ensure the loop starts and executes at least once.
   - `n` remains an input integer but no further adjustments are needed for its value.

So, the final state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer**
