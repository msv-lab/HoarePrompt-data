Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
