Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. If `n` is equal to 2, then `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, then `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on its previous value.
