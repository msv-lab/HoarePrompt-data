Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python to indicate that the value of the loop variable is not needed.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the expression inside `range(int(input()))` evaluates to a non-negative integer. In this case, the loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**: The initial state given is:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the input to `int(input())` results in a positive integer. Since `t` is already defined and within the required range, we can use `t` to represent the input value for the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `t`.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute for each test case, as `t` will be a valid positive integer within the specified range.
