Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or the condition involving `s`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
