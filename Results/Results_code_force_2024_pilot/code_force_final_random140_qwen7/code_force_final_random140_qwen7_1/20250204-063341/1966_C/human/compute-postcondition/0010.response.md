Output State: `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `s` contains all elements from `arr`, i.e., `s` contains `{arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]}`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will still be greater than 0 (since the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0), `i` will be equal to the final value of `n` (which is `n` itself after all iterations), and the set `s` will contain every element from the list `arr`.
