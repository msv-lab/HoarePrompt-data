Output State: **`ans` is either -1, 0, or 1, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]**.

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be either -1, 0, or 1. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations from 1 to `n-1`. The list `s` remains unchanged with its initial structure `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]`. The final value of `ans` depends on how many times the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was met during the loop's execution, flipping the value of `ans` each time it was false and breaking the loop when it was true.
