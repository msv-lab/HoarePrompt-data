Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `n` is equal to the length of list `s`.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.
- `n` is explicitly stated to be 2.

Given these details, let's break down the code snippet:

```python
print('Alice')
```

The `print` statement here simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
