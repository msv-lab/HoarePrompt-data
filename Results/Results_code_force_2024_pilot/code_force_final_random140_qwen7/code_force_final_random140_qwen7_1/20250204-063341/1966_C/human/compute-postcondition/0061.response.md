Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `s` is a set containing the elements of `arr[0]` and `arr[4]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `s` has added `arr[4]` to itself.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is 4, `s` will now contain the elements `arr[0]` and `arr[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
