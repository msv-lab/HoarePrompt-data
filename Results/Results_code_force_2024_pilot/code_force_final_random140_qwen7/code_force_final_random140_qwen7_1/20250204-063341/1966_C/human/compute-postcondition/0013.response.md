Output State: **`ans` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or the list `s`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
