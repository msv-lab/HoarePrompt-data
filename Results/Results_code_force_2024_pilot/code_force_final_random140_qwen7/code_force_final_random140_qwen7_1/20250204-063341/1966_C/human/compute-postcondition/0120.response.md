Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` is the length of list `s`
   - `s` is a list where the first element is 0 and followed by all unique elements from the list `arr`
   - `ans` is 1
   - The length of the list `s` is equal to 2

2. From the initial state, we know:
   - Since the length of list `s` is 2, `n` must be 2.
   - Therefore, `i` is also 2 because `i` is equal to `n`.

3. The list `s` has a length of 2, so it must look like this: `[0, x]`, where `x` is a unique element from `arr`.

4. The `print('Alice')` statement will simply print the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
