Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a set containing the first element of `arr` and `arr[i]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contains the first element of `arr`. After adding `arr[i]` (where `i` is 2), `s` now contains both the first element and `arr[i]`. The values of `ans`, `i`, `n`, and the nature of `arr` and `s` remain as described in the initial state, with the additional information that `s` now includes `arr[i]`.
