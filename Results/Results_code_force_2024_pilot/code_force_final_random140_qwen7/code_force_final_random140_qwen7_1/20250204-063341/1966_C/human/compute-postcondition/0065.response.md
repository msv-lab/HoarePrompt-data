Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`**

Explanation: The line `ans = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `ans`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
