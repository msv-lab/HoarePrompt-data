Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a set containing the first element of `arr`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code adds the element at index `i` (which is 0) of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Initially, `i` is 0. After executing `s.add(arr[i])`, `i` is incremented to 1. The set `s` now contains the first element of `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
