Output State: **`ans` is either 1 or 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `ans`, `i`, `n`, or `s`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
