Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking a single line of space-separated integers as input, splitting the input string into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original value of `n` remains unchanged, but now `arr` holds the list of integers derived from the input.
