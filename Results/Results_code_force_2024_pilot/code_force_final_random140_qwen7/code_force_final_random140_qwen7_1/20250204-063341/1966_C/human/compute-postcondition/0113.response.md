Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` remains the same (an input integer), `s` is a set containing all elements from the list `arr`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that all elements in the list `arr` have been processed. The set `s` will contain every unique element from the list `arr`, as each element was added to the set `s` during each iteration of the loop.
