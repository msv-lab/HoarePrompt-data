Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state's information about other variables remains unchanged, and the only new information is that `n` is now an integer resulting from the input.
