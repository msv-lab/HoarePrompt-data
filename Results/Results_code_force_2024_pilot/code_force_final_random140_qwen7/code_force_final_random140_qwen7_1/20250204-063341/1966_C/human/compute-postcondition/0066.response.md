Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]`**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends the value `0` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains all elements of `arr` from index `0` to `n-1`. After the operation, `s` becomes a list starting with `0` followed by the original elements of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
