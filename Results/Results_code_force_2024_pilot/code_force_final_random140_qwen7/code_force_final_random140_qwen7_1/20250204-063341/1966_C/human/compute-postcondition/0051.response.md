Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, and `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. If `n` equals 2, then `ans` remains as 1. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on its previous value.
