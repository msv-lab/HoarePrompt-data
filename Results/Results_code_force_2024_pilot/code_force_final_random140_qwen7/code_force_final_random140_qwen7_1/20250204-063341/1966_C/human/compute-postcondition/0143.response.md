Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop continues as long as \( s[i] - s[i - 1] \leq 1 \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \).
- After all iterations, \( i \) will be \( n-1 \).
- \( n \) must be greater than 1.
- \( ans \) will not be 0 if no break condition was met during any iteration.

The print statement is `print('Bob')`.

Given this information, the print statement directly outputs the string 'Bob'. There are no variables or objects within the print statement that need further explanation beyond the string itself.

Output: **Bob**
