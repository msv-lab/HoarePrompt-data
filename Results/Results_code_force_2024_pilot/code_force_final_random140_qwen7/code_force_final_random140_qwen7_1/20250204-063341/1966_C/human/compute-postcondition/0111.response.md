Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` remains the same (an input integer), `s` is a set containing the element `arr[n]` and also potentially other elements added from subsequent iterations of the loop.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is initially `n`, the set `s` will contain `arr[n]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `s` now includes the element `arr[n]`.
