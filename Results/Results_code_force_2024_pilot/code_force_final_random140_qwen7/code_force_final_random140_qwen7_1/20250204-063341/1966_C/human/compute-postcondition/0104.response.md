Output State: **`ans` is either -1, 0, or 1, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]`, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `arr`. The variables `ans`, `i`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
