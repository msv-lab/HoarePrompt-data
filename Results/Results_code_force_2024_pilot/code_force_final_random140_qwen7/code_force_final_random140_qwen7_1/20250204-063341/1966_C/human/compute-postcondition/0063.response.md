Output State: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from user input.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n - 1`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The set `s` will contain all elements of the list `arr` from index 0 to `n-1` because each element of `arr` is added to `s` in each iteration of the loop. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `n` is always true since `n` does not change within the loop.
