Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `s` contains `arr[3]`**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is 3, the element `arr[3]` is added to the set `s`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `n` must still be greater than 0 and `i` remains 3.
