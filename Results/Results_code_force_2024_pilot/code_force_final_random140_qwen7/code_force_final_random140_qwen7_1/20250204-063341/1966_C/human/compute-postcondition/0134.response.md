Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `ans` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.

4. **Check the current value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

5. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.

6. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` must be greater than 1, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

7. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 3
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 (no change needed here)
   - `ans` remains 0 (since the loop did not break out due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is 0**
