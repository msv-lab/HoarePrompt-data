Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list where the first element is 0 and followed by all unique elements from the list `arr`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `i` and `ans` remains unchanged. The list `s` is not modified, so its structure remains the same, with the first element being 0 and followed by all unique elements from the list `arr`.
