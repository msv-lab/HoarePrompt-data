Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]**.

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` updates the value of `n` to be the length of the list `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial value of `n` was `n + 1`, but now it is updated to the actual length of the list `s`. The list `s` remains the same as it was initially defined.
