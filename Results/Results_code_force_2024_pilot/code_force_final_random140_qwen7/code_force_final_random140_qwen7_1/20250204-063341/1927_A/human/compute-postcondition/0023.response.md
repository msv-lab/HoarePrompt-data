Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, and s, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, and s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B'. The function returns a value based on the conditions specified for s.**

Note: The actual return value is not specified in the given information, only the conditions and constraints for the input variables.
