Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, finds the first and last positions of 'B' in `s`, calculates the minimum number of consecutive 'B' characters between these positions, and prints this value. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is set to 0.**
