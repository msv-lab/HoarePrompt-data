State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` in the expression `range(t)`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), the minimum value `t` can take is 1.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since `t` is the only variable involved in the loop head, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted accordingly.
