Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by three variables: t (a positive integer between 1 and 10^4), n (a positive integer between 1 and 10), and s (a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'). It returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.**
