Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'. For each test case, it finds the start and end indices of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`. If 'B' is found, it prints the distance between these indices; otherwise, it prints 0. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
