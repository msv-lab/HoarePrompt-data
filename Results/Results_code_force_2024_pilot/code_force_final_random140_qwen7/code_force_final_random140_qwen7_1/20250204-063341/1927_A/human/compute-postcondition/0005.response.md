Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found; `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found.**

The code `last_black = s.rfind('B')` finds the index of the last occurrence of the character 'B' in the string `s`. If 'B' is not found, it returns -1. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `first_black` remain unchanged from their initial states.
