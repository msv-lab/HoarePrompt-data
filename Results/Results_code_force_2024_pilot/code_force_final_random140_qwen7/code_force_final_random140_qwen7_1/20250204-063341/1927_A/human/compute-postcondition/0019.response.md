Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found; `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found.**

Explanation: The code `last_black = s.rfind('B')` finds the index of the last occurrence of the character 'B' in the string `s`. If 'B' is not found in `s`, `rfind` returns -1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`, nor does it change the value of `first_black`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain the same, while `last_black` is updated to reflect the index of the last 'B' in `s`.
