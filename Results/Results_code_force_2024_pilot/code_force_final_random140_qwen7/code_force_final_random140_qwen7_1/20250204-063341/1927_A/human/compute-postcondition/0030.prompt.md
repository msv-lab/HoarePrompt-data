Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10; s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in s is 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t = int(input())
    x = list(input())
    if 'B' in x:
        start = x.index('B')
        end = len(x) - x[::-1].index('B') - 1
        print(end - start)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, `t` is the input integer converted to an integer, `x` is a list of characters from the input string. If the character 'B' is in the list `x`, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' and `end` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the reversed list `x`. If 'B' is not in the list `x`, no additional variables are introduced.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1; `t` is an input integer; `x` is a list of characters from the input string; if 'B' is found in the list `x`, `start` is the index of the first 'B' and `end` is the index of the last 'B' in the reversed list `x`. If 'B' is not found in the list `x`, no new variables `start` and `end` are introduced.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `x` is a list containing characters from the input string. If 'B' is found in the list `x`, `i` remains 2, `t` remains unchanged, and `x` is a list containing characters from the input string with additional information about the start and end indices of 'B'. If 'B' is not found in the list `x`, `i` remains 2, `t` remains unchanged, and `x` is a list containing characters from the input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
