Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program calculates the distance between the first and last black cells but does not account for the possibility that there might be multiple segments of black cells that need to be painted. For instance, in the input "BWBBWW", the program would incorrectly calculate the minimum length as 4 (painting from the 2nd to the 5th cell), but the correct answer should be 3 (painting from the 2nd to the 4th cell). This is because the segment needs to cover all black cells, not just the first and last ones.
