You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        first_black = s.find('B')
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        print(min_paint)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        first_black = s.find('B')
        
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        
        print(min_paint)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, as it starts as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive) and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, `n` will be an input integer, `s` will be an input string, `first_black` will be the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found; `last_black` will be the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found; `min_paint` will be `last_black - first_black + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program calculates the distance between the first and last black cells but does not account for the possibility that there might be multiple segments of black cells that need to be painted. For instance, in the input "BWBBWW", the program would incorrectly calculate the minimum length as 4 (painting from the 2nd to the 5th cell), but the correct answer should be 3 (painting from the 2nd to the 4th cell). This is because the segment needs to cover all black cells, not just the first and last ones.
