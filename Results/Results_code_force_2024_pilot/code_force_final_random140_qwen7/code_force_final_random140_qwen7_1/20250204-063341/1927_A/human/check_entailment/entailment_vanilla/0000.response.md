### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that, when painted white, will make all cells white.
   - This means we need to find the shortest segment that includes all black cells.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strip (`n`) and the string representing the strip (`s`).
   - It finds the index of the first black cell (`first_black`) and the index of the last black cell (`last_black`).
   - The length of the segment to be painted is calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of this segment.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the first and last positions of black cells.
   - The length calculation `last_black - first_black + 1` is correct because it accounts for the inclusive nature of the segment (both the first and last black cells are included).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there is only one black cell, `first_black` and `last_black` will be the same, and the length will be 1, which is correct.
   - If all cells are white, `first_black` and `last_black` will not be found, but the problem guarantees at least one black cell, so this case does not apply here.

5. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the example input "WBBWBW", the first black cell is at index 2 and the last black cell is at index 5. The length is `5 - 2 + 1 = 4`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to make all cells white.

**Correctness: True**
