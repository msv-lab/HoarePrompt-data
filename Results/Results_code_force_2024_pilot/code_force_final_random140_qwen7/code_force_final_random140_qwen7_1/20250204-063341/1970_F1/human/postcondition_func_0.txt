The function processes a game scenario represented by a grid, players, and goals. It reads initial setup data from standard input, including the grid dimensions, grid content, and game parameters. It then processes a series of commands for each game step, updating player positions, handling golden snitch catches, eliminations, and goal scoring. Finally, it prints the final scores for both teams.
