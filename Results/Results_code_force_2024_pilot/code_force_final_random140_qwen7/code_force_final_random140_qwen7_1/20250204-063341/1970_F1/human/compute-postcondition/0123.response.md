Postcondition: **`elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`, `ind` is 1 (if it was 0 previously) or 2 (if it was 1 previously), `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.**
