Output State: **`obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the first element of `command`, `pos` is equal to `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `nxt` to be a tuple where the first element is the sum of the first coordinate of `pos` and the first coordinate of `mov[com]`, and the second element is the sum of the second coordinate of `pos` and the second coordinate of `mov[com]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
