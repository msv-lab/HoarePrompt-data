Output State: **`obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the first element of `command`, and `pos` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `obj, com = comand` swaps the values of `obj` and `com`. Initially, `obj` is the second element of `command` and `com` is the first element of `command`. After executing the code, `obj` becomes the first element of `command`, which was originally `com`, and `com` becomes the second element of `command`, which was originally `obj`. The variable `pos` remains undefined as it was not affected by the code.
