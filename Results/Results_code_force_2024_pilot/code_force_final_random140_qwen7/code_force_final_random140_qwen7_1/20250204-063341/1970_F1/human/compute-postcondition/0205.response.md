Output State: **`obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the first element of `command`, `pos` is equal to `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code `allPlayers[obj] = False` changes the value of `allPlayers[obj]` to `False`. All other variables (`obj`, `com`, `pos`, and `nxt`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
