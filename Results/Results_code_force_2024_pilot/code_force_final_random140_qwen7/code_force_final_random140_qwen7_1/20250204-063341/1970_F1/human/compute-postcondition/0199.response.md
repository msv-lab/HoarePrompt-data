Postcondition: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else 0; if `el` is '.', `points[team]` is increased by 10.**
