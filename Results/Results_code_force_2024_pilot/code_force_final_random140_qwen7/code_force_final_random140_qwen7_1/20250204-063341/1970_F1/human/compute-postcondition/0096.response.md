Output State: **`line` is a list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()`, `elements` will contain key-value pairs for each non-'..' element in `line`, `allPlayers` will be updated for any player elements in `line`, `goal` will contain tuples `(i, index)` for each goal element in `line` that belongs to a player, `tmp` will determine which list in `goal` to append to based on the first character of the goal element, and `i` will be the length of `line`.**

This means that the `line` variable now holds a list of strings after reading a line from standard input, stripping any trailing whitespace, and splitting it into a list. The `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` variables will be updated based on the content of `line`, and the `tmp` variable will be set to determine which list in `goal` to append to based on the first character of the goal elements. The variable `i` is now equal to the length of the `line` list.
