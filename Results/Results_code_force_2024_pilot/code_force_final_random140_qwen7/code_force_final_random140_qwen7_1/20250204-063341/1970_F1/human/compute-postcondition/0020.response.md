Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`, `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `i` is 0 and `ind` is not specified in the initial state but is assumed to be valid given the context, `goal[tmp]` now contains this tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.
