Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Incrementing `time`:**
   - `time` is incremented by 1. Let's assume the initial value of `time` was `t`. After incrementing, `time` becomes `t + 1`.

2. **Defining `comand`:**
   - `comand` is a list of strings. We don't know the exact content of this list, but we need to access its first and second elements.

3. **Assigning `obj` and `com`:**
   - `obj` is assigned the first element of `comand`.
   - `com` is assigned the second element of `comand`.

4. **Assigning `pos`:**
   - `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`. This means `pos` is a tuple representing the position of the element indexed by `obj` in the `elements` list or dictionary.

5. **Calculating `nxt`:**
   - `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. Here, `mov[com]` is a tuple that represents movement in the x and y directions based on the command `com`. So, `nxt` is the new position after moving from `pos` according to the command `com`.

6. **Determining `player`:**
   - `player` is determined based on the condition `isPlayer(obj)`. If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is set to `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, which is the grid value at the new position `nxt`.

7. **Printing the result:**
   - The print statement is `print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))`. This will print the current value of `time` followed by the string "ELIMINATED" and the value of `player`.

Given the above steps, the print statement will output:

Output: **(t + 1) obj ELIMINATED** (where `t` is the initial value of `time`, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, and `player` is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`).
