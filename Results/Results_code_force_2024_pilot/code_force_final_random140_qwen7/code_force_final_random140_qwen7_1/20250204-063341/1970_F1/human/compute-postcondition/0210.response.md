Output State: **`obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the first element of `command`, `pos` is equal to `nxt`, `nxt` is equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `elements[obj]` to `nxt`. According to the initial state, `nxt` is defined as `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. Therefore, after executing the code, the value of `elements[obj]` is updated to this expression. All other variables remain unchanged.
