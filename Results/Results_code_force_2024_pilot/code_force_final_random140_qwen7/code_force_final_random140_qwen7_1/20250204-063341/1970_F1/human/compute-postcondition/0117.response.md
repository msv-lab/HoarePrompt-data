Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `ind` and `line`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the indices of the list `line`. Therefore, `ind` will take values from `0` to `len(line) - 1`.

3. **Determine the state changes inside the loop**: The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider what happens to the variables `ind` and `line` as the loop progresses.

4. **Analyze the given postcondition**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `ind` is either `0` or `1`.
   - `line` must have at least one element.
   - The current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`.
   - `elements[line[ind]]` is either assigned the tuple `(i, ind)` or not assigned.
   - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True` and the value is not `'G'`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.
   - If `line[ind][1]` is `'G'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `tmp` is set to `1` and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.

5. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented by `1`. Since `ind` was either `0` or `1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `1` or `2` respectively.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `ind` is updated and that the conditions for the next iteration are met. Specifically, `ind` will be incremented by `1`, and the other conditions will depend on the new value of `ind`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ind` will be `1` if it was `0` previously, or `2` if it was `1` previously.
- `line` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- The conditions for `line[ind]` and the assignments to `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` will depend on the new value of `ind`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ind` is 1 (if it was 0 previously) or 2 (if it was 1 previously), `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is either assigned the tuple `(i, ind)` or not assigned, depending on whether `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns True or False. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns True and the value is not `'G'`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `line[ind][1]` is `'G'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, then `tmp` is set to 1 and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`**.
