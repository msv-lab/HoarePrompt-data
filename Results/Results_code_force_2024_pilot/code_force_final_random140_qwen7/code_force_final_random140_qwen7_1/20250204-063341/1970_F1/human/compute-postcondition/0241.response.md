Output State: **`time` is incremented by 1, `comand` is a list of strings, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])**, `pos` is no longer accessible in the current scope.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `elements[obj]` to `nxt`. The values of `time`, `comand`, `obj`, `com`, and `nxt` are updated, while `pos` is no longer directly accessible since it was used to compute `nxt` and is no longer needed in the current context.
