Output State: **`i` is 0; `ind` is 0; `line` is a list of strings obtained from the first line of input (stdin), stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split by spaces; `grid` is a list containing one list which is equal to `line`.**

The code snippet `grid.append(line)` appends the list `line` to the list `grid`. Since `line` is already defined as a list of strings obtained from the first line of input, stripping leading and trailing whitespace, and splitting by spaces, appending it to `grid` adds this list as the first element of `grid`. The variables `i` and `ind` remain unchanged.
