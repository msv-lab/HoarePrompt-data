Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`.

- If `obj` is equal to '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true, or if `isPlayer(obj)` is true and `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, then:
  - If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `points[team]` is incremented by 1.
  - Otherwise, `player` is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is true or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and no other changes are made.

- If none of the above conditions are met, then:
  - `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false, `isPlayer(obj)` is true, and `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.
  - If `com` is 'T', `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1.
  - Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
