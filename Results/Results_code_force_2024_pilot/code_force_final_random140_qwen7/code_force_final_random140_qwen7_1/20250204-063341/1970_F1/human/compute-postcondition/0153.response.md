Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `obj` is the first string from the command list, `com` is the second string from the command list, `el` is the third string from the command list. If `el` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. Otherwise, `el` is not equal to '.Q'. If `el` is '.S', then `team` is 0 if `obj[0]` is not 'B', else `team` is 1; points[team] is increased by 10. If `el` is neither '.Q' nor '.S', no changes occur.
