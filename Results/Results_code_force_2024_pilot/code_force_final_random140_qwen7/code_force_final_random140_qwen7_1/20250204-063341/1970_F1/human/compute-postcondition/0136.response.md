Output State: **All elements in `line` have been processed, meaning `ind` is equal to `len(line) - 1`. The `elements` dictionary contains key-value pairs where each non-empty cell in `line` maps to a tuple `(i, ind)`. If a cell in `line` represents a player, `allPlayers` dictionary marks it as `False`. For cells representing goals ('BG' or 'RG'), `goal` list corresponding to the team (0 or 1) will contain tuples `(i, ind)` indicating the position of the goal.**

This output state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations, processing every index in `line`. Each non-empty cell in `line` has been checked, and the necessary updates have been made to the `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` dictionaries/lists based on the conditions specified within the loop.
