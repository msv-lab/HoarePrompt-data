Output State: **`i` is 1, `ind` is 3, `tmp` is 0**

Explanation: The code checks if the first character of `line[ind]` (which is `line[3]` given the initial state) is 'B'. Since the initial state shows `elements[line[3]]` is 1, it implies that `line[3]` is an index pointing to an element in the `elements` list. If the first character of `line[3]` is not 'B', `tmp` is assigned the value 1. Given no specific value for `line[3]` other than `elements[line[3]]` being 1, we assume the first character is not 'B' (since there's no indication it is), thus `tmp` is set to 1. However, since the condition checks for 'B' and does not specify 'B', we assume it is not 'B' and hence `tmp` is 0. The values of `i` and `ind` remain unchanged.
