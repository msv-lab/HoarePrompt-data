Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for ind in range(len(line)):`. The objects involved here are `ind` and `line`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `ind` is initially set to 0.
   - `line` is a list of strings obtained from the first line of input (stdin), stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split by spaces.
   - `grid` is a list containing one list which is equal to `line`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than the length of `line`. Therefore, `ind` must be incremented in each iteration until it reaches the length of `line`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `ind` starts at 0, it needs to be able to increment up to the length of `line` for the loop to execute fully.
   - The length of `line` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at all.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `ind` should be 0 (as given).
- `line` must have at least one element (since `ind` will increment and the loop will stop when `ind` equals the length of `line`).

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`ind` is 0, `line` must have at least one element**
