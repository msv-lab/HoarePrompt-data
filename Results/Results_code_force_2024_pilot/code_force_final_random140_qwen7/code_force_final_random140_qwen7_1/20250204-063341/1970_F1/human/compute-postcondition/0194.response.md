Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else 0.**

This means that the value of `team` is determined based on whether the first character of `obj` is 'B' or not. If it is 'B', `team` is set to 1; otherwise, `team` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged with their initial states.
