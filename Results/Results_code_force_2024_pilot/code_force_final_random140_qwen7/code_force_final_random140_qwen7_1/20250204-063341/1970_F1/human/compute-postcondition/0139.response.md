Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for time in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `time`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `time`**: The variable `time` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **Adjust the required states**: Since `time` starts at 0 and the loop will continue as long as `time < t`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`. We need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer so that the loop can execute at least once.

4. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`i`, `ind`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be a positive integer**
