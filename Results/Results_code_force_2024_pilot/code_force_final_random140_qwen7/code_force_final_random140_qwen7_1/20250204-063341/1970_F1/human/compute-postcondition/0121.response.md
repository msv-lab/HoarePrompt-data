Output State: **`elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`, `ind` is 1 (if it was 0 previously) or 2 (if it was 1 previously), `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is either assigned the tuple `(i, ind)` or not assigned, depending on whether `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns True or False, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The line of code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. The value of `tmp` is determined by the condition `line[ind][0] == 'B'`, which means if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0, otherwise `tmp` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
