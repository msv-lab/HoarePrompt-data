Postcondition: **`obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the first element of `command`, and `pos` is updated according to the following rules: if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is also a player, or if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is where the black piece ('.B') is located, then `player` is set to `obj`. Otherwise, if the goal is reached from the current position `pos` or the player at `obj` is valid, `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]` and `pos` is set to `nxt`. If the goal is reached, the points for the team are increased by 1.**
