Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `ind`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `ind` is within the range of `len(line)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is either 0 or 1.
   - `line` must have at least one element.
   - The current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`.
   - `elements[line[ind]]` is either assigned the value `i` (if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True` and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`) or not assigned the value `i` (if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`).
   - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True` and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains the tuple `(i, 1)`. Otherwise, these conditions remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `ind` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - We need to ensure that `ind` does not exceed `len(line) - 1` to keep the loop valid.
   - The conditions related to `line[ind]` and `elements[line[ind]]` will change based on the new value of `ind`.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `ind` will be `1` if it was `0` in the previous iteration, or `0` if it was `1` in the previous iteration.
   - `line` remains the same.
   - `elements[line[ind]]` will be checked based on the new value of `ind`.
   - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True` and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` will be 1 and `goal[1]` will contain the tuple `(i, 1)`. Otherwise, these conditions remain unchanged.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- If `ind` was 0, it will now be 1.
- If `ind` was 1, it will now be 0.
- The other conditions remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ind` is 1, `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[1]` is not '..', `elements[line[1]]` is either assigned the value `i` (if `isPlayer(line[1])` returns `True` and `allPlayers[line[1]]` is `False`) or not assigned the value `i` (if `isPlayer(line[1])` returns `False`). If `isPlayer(line[1])` returns `True` and `line[1][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains the tuple `(i, 1)`. Otherwise, these conditions remain unchanged.**
