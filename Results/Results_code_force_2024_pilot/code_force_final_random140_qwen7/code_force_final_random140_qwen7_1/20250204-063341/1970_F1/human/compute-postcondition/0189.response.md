Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, and `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`. 

- If `len(comand) == 3`, then:
  - If `el` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True.
  - If `el` is equal to '.S':
    - If `obj[0]` is not 'B', then `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10.
    - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1, and `points[team]` is increased by 10.
  - If `el` is neither '.Q' nor '.S', no changes occur.

- Otherwise (`len(comand) != 3`):
  - `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`.
  - If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true or `isPlayer(obj)` is true and `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, then `obj` remains unchanged and `com` is not equal to 'T'.
  - If `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false, `isPlayer(obj)` is true, and `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`, then:
    - If `com` is 'T', `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1.
    - Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` and `com` is not equal to 'T'.
