Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, and `com` is the second element of `comand`.**

The code assigns the first element of the list `comand` to the variable `obj` and the second element to the variable `com`. The values of `t` and `comand` remain unchanged from their initial state.
