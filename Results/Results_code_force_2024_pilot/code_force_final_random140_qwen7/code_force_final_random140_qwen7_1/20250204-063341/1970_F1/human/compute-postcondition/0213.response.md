Postcondition: **`obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the first element of `command`, `pos` is updated to either `nxt` or `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]` depending on whether the goal is reached or the player is valid. If the goal is reached (`goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`), then `points[team]` is increased by 1. If the player at position `obj` is valid, `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]` and `pos` is set to `nxt`.**
