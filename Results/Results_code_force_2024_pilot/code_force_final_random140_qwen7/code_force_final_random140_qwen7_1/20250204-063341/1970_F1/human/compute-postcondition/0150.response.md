Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `obj` is the first string from the command list.
   - `com` is the second string from the command list.
   - `el` is set to '.S'.
   - `team` is determined as follows:
     - If `obj[0]` is not 'B', then `team` is 0.
     - Otherwise, `team` is 1.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `time` is not explicitly defined, but it must be a positive integer since `t` is a positive integer and `time` likely refers to `t`.
- `GoalName` is a list of strings, and `team` is either 0 or 1, so `GoalName[team]` will refer to either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]`.

Given the above, the print statement will output:
- The value of `time` (which is `t`).
- The string `CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`.
- The string from `GoalName` corresponding to the value of `team`.

Since `team` is either 0 or 1, and without knowing the exact value of `obj[0]`, we can only describe `team` as either 0 or 1. Therefore, `GoalName[team]` will be either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]`.

Output: **%d CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where %d is the value of t and CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH is the string from GoalName corresponding to the value of team, which is either 0 or 1)**
