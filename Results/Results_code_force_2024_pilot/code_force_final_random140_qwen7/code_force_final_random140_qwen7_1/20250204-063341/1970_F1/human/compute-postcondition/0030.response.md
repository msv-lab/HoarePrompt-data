Output State: **`i` is 1; `ind` is 2; `tmp` is 0 if line[2][0] == 'B' else 1**

The code assigns `tmp` the value `0` if the first character of `line` at index `ind` (which is `line[2]`) is 'B', otherwise it assigns `1`. Since the exact value of `line[2][0]` is not given, `tmp` will take the value based on that condition. The values of `i` and `ind` remain unchanged.
