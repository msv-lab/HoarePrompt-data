Output State: **`i` is 0, `ind` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the first line of input (stdin), stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split by spaces.**

The code reads a line of input from standard input (`stdin`), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `line`. The values of `i` and `ind` remain unchanged.
