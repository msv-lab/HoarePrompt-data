Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split.
- `obj` is the first element of `command`.
- `com` is the second element of `command`.
- `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop runs for `t` iterations.
- The loop body is omitted.

### Loop Execution:
- The loop iterates over `time` in the range from 0 to `t-1`.

### States to Adjust:
- We need to consider how the loop updates the states based on its execution.
- Since the loop does not explicitly update the values of `t`, `command`, `obj`, `com`, and `pos` within the loop body (as per the given code snippet), these states remain unchanged unless there is an external condition or action that modifies them.

### Conclusion:
- Given that the loop does not modify `t`, `command`, `obj`, `com`, and `pos` directly within its body, these states remain the same for each iteration.

### Final Answer:
Since the loop does not change the values of `t`, `command`, `obj`, `com`, and `pos`, these states remain the same for the next iteration.

**State: **`t` is a positive integer, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`.**
