Output State: **`ind` is 2 (if it was 1 previously) or 3 (if it was 2 previously), `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..', elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(i, ind)` appended to its previous content, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][1]` is `'G'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False.**

Explanation: The line `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since the initial conditions state that `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][1]` is `'G'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, appending the tuple again does not change this condition. All other variables remain unchanged as no new assignments are made to them.
