Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the first line of standard input after stripping and splitting it.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and splits it into a list of strings. This operation does not affect the values of `i` or `n`, but introduces a new variable `line` which contains the split result. Since no specific values are provided for the input, `line` remains a list of strings.
