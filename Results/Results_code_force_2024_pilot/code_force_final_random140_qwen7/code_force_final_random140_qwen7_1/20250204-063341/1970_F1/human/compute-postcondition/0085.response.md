Output State: **`ind` is 4, `elements[line[1]]` is assigned the value `i`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`, `tmp` and `goal` retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `allPlayers[line[ind]]` to `False`. Given that `ind` is 4, `line[ind]` refers to `line[4]`. The value of `elements[line[1]]` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Variables `tmp` and `goal` also retain their previous values since they are not mentioned in this line of code.
