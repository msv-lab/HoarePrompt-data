Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `player` is defined as `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement to be executed is `print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to know the values of `time` and `player`.

- **Value of `player`**:
  - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player = obj`.
  - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `False`, then `player = grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

- **Value of `time`**:
  - The value of `time` is not explicitly given in the initial state, so it remains as `time`.

Given this information, the output will be a string formatted as `'%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player)`, where `%d` is replaced by the value of `time` and `%s` is replaced by the value of `player`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **%d [player] ELIMINATED** (where `[player]` is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is `True` or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `isPlayer(obj)` is `False`, and `%d` is the value of `time`).
