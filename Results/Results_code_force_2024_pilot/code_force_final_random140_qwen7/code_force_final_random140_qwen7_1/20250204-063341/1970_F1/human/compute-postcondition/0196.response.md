Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split.
   - `obj` is the second element of `command`.
   - `com` is the third element of `command`.
   - `el` is the third element of `command` (which is the same as `com`).
   - `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))`.

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `time`: This is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it remains as `time`.
   - `GoalName[team]`: The value of `GoalName` depends on the value of `team`, which is determined by the first character of `obj`.
     - If the first character of `obj` is 'B', then `team` is 1, and `GoalName[team]` would be `GoalName[1]`.
     - If the first character of `obj` is not 'B', then `team` is 0, and `GoalName[team]` would be `GoalName[0]`.

Given this breakdown, the print statement will output a string with `time` and `GoalName[team]` where `team` is either 0 or 1 depending on the first character of `obj`.

Output: **%d GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where team is 1 if the first character of obj is 'B', else 0)**
