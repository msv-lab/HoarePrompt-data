Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The resulting list of strings is assigned to `comand`.
