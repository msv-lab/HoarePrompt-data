Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ind` and `line`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `line` and `line[ind]` is not `'..'`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **`ind`**: The value of `ind` will increment by 1 at each iteration.
   - **`line`**: The length of `line` does not change within the loop; it remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.
   - **`elements[line[ind]]`**: This assignment will happen inside the loop, but it doesn't affect the loop continuation condition.
   - **`allPlayers[line[ind]]`**: This assignment will happen inside the loop, but it doesn't affect the loop continuation condition.
   - **`tmp`**: The value of `tmp` will depend on the first character of `line[ind]`, but this doesn't affect the loop continuation condition.
   - **`goal[tmp]`**: This assignment will happen inside the loop, but it doesn't affect the loop continuation condition.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `ind` will increment by 1, if `ind` was 1 previously, it will become 2, and if `ind` was 2 previously, it will become 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `line` must have at least one element and `line[ind]` must not be `'..'`. Since these conditions are checked at the beginning of each iteration, they remain the same unless `line` changes outside the loop.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `ind` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `line` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ind` is 2 (if it was 1 previously) or 3 (if it was 2 previously), `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][1]` is `'G'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False.**
