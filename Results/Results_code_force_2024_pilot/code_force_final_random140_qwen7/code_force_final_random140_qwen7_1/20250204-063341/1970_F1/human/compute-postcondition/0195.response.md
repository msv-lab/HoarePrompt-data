Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else 0; points[team] is increased by 10.**

Explanation: The code increments the value at `points[team]` by 10. The value of `team` is determined by whether the first character of `obj` is 'B' or not. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
