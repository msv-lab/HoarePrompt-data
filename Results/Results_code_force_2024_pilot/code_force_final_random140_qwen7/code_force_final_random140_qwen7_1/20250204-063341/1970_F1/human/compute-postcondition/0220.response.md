Output State: **`time` is incremented by 1, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input from stdin, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the result into a list of strings. This list is assigned to the variable `comand`. The initial state of `time` being incremented by 1 remains unchanged, and the newly created variable `comand` holds the split input.
