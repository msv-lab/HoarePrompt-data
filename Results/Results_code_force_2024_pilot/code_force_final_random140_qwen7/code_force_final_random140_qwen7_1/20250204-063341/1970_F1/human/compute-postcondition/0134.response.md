Postcondition: `ind` is 2 (if it was 1 previously) or 3 (if it was 2 previously), `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`. `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` either contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][1] is 'G'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, or is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True.
