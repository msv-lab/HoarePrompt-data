Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(stdin.readline().strip())`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `ind` is equal to `n-1`, `elements` dictionary maps non-empty cells to their coordinates, `allPlayers` dictionary marks players as `False`, and `goal` list contains positions of goals for each team.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `t` from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace before converting it to an integer. This value is stored in the variable `t`. The values of `i` and `ind` remain unchanged from their previous state, which is `n-1`. The dictionaries and lists (`elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal`) retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
