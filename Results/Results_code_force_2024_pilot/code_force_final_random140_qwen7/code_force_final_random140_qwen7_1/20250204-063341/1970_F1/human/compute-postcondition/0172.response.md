Output State: **`team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, `t` is a positive integer, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false, `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`, and `points[team]` is 1 more than its previous value.**

Explanation: The code `points[team] += 1` increments the value of `points[team]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
