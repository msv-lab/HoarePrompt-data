Output State: **`obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the first element of `command`, `pos` is equal to `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`**.

This means that the function `goalIn(pos)` has been called with the current position `pos`, and the result of this function call (whether a goal was scored or not) has been stored in the variable `team`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
