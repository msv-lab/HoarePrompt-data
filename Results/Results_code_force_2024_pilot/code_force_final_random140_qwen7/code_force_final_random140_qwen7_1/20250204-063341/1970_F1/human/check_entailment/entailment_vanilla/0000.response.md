### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the grid, elements dictionary, allPlayers dictionary, goal lists, and points counters.
   - It reads the grid dimensions and populates the grid, elements, and allPlayers dictionaries. It also identifies the goals and stores their positions.

2. **Command Processing:**
   - The function processes each command in the game steps.
     - For commands involving catching or throwing the Quaffle, it updates the state correctly.
     - For movement commands, it checks if the move is valid and updates the position accordingly.
     - It handles scoring scenarios by checking if a player has moved the Quaffle into the opponent's goal.
     - It prints the appropriate events and updates the points counter.

3. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The `goalIn` function correctly determines which team's goal a given position belongs to.
   - The `isPlayer` function correctly identifies players based on their prefix ('R' or 'B') and suffix (not 'G').

4. **Output Formatting:**
   - The function prints the events in the correct format and order.
   - It prints the final score at the end of the game.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles various edge cases such as invalid movements, catching the Quaffle, and throwing the Quaffle.
   - It ensures that the Quaffle is only thrown when the player is carrying it and that the player is in the correct position to catch the Quaffle.

### Conclusion:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the required functionalities and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
