### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the grid, elements dictionary, allPlayers dictionary, goal lists, and points counters.
   - It reads the grid dimensions and populates the grid, elements, and allPlayers dictionaries. It also identifies the goals and stores their positions.
   - The initialization seems correct, and the parsing of the input is done accurately.

2. **Command Processing:**
   - The function processes each command in the game steps.
     - For commands involving catching or throwing the Quaffle, it updates the state correctly.
     - For movement commands, it checks if the move is valid and updates the position accordingly.
     - It handles scoring scenarios by checking if a player has moved the Quaffle into the opponent's goal.
     - It prints the appropriate events and updates the points counter.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the handling of scoring scenarios. The function `goalIn` is used to determine which team's goal a given position belongs to. This function works correctly, but the logic in `func_1` for scoring is flawed.

3. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The `goalIn` function correctly determines which team's goal a given position belongs to.
   - The `isPlayer` function correctly identifies players based on their prefix ('R' or 'B') and suffix (not 'G').
   - The issue lies in how the scoring is handled. The function `func_1` does not correctly update the points when a player scores. Specifically, it should check if the Quaffle is placed in the opponent's goal and then update the points accordingly. Instead, it uses a simple check that is insufficient to handle all scenarios.

4. **Output Formatting:**
   - The function prints the events in the correct format and order.
   - It prints the final score at the end of the game.
   - The output formatting is correct, but the underlying logic for scoring needs to be fixed.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles various edge cases such as invalid movements, catching the Quaffle, and throwing the Quaffle.
   - However, the edge case where a player scores in the opponent's goal is not handled correctly. The function does not update the points when the Quaffle is thrown into the opponent's goal.

### Conclusion:

The provided Python program almost correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, but there is a critical flaw in the scoring logic. The function `func_1` does not correctly update the points when a player scores by moving the Quaffle into the opponent's goal. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Final:
**False**
