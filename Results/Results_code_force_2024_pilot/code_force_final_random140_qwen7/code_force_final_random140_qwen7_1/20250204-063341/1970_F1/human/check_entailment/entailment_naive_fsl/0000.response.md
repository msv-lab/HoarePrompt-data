Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal, which results in the opposing team winning a point. According to the problem description, if a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team wins the point. However, the provided code does not account for this specific case. For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5

.. .. R0 .. ..

RG .. .Q .. BG

.. .. B0 .. ..

12

R0 D

R0 C .Q

R0 L

R0 L

R0 T

```

In this case, the red player takes the Quaffle, moves it, and throws it into its own goal. The program should detect this and award a point to the blue team, but it does not do so. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
