N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string containing M characters. Each string in the list corresponds to a row in the field. The field contains unique identifiers for players (R0-R9, B0-B9), goals (RG, BG), and the Quaffle (.Q). T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. Each step is described by a string containing the identifier of the entity performing the action and the action itself (U, D, L, R, C, T).
