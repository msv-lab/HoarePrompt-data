Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`, `ls` is updated to a list of strings from input, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `ls = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This updates the list `ls`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `last`, `other`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
