Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading/trailing whitespace, `ls` is a list of strings, `last` is the last element of the updated `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input().strip())` reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. The value of `n` is now an integer, and the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 and the definitions of `i`, `n`, `ls`, `last`, and `other` remain valid.
