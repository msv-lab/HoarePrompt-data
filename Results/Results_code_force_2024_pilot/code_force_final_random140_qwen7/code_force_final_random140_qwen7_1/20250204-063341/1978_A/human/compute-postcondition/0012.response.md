Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this does not affect the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer (its value is unknown but it doesn't affect the print statement either).
- `ls` is a list of strings (its contents are unknown but it will be sorted later).
- `last` is the last element of the updated `ls` converted to an integer.
- `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(last + other)
```

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the components:
- `last` is the last element of the updated `ls` converted to an integer. This means `last` is the integer value of the last string in the sorted list `ls`.
- `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`. This means `other` is the integer value of the second largest string in the sorted list `ls`.

Therefore, the print statement will add these two values together and print the result.

Output: **last (converted to integer) + other (second largest element in sorted ls)**
