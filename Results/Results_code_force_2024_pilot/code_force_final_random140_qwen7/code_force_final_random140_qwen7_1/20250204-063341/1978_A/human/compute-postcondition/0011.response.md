Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings, `last` is the last element of the updated `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`, `ls` is updated to a list of strings from input, `n` is an input integer, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`.**

Explanation: The code `other = int(sorted(ls).pop())` sorts the list `ls`, removes the last element (which is now the smallest in the sorted list), and assigns its integer value to `other`. The other variables remain unchanged. The updated list `ls` is still a list of strings, and `last` is now the last element of the updated `ls` converted to an integer.
