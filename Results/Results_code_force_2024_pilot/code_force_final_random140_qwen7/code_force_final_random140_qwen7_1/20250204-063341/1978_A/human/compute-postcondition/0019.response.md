Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading/trailing whitespace for each iteration, `ls` is a list of strings with the last element removed in each iteration, `last` is the last element of the final updated `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`.

In this final state, the variable `t` will still hold its initial value, which is an integer between 1 and 500. The variable `i` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. For each iteration, `n` will be an integer input stripped of leading/trailing whitespace, and `ls` will be a list of strings, with the last element removed after processing. After all iterations, `last` will be the last element of the final updated `ls` converted to an integer, and `other` will be the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`.
