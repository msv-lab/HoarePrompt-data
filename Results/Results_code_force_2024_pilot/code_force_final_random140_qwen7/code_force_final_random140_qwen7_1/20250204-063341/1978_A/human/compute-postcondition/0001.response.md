State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
- For the loop `for i in range(t):` to execute, the value of `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
- Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.
- Since `i` is initialized to 0 within the loop, no adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts.

So, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect these conditions:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
