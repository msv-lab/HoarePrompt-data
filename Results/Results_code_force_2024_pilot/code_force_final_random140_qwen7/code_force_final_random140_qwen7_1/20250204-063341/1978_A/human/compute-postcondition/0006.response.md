Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ls` is a list of strings.
- `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `ls` converted to an integer.
- `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`.

The print statement is `print(last + other)`. To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the values of `last` and `other`.

1. **`last`**: This is the last element of the list `ls` converted to an integer.
2. **`other`**: This is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`.

Since the exact content of the list `ls` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `last` and `other`. However, we can describe them based on the information given.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the last element of the list `ls` (converted to an integer) and the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`.

Output: **last (the last element of `ls` converted to an integer) + other (the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`)**
