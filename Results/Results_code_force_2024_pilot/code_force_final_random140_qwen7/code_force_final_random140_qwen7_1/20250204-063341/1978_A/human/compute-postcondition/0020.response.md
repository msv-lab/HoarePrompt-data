Output State: `t` must be greater than 2, `i` is the final iteration count minus one, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading/trailing whitespace, `ls` is a list of strings with elements continuously removed based on the loop iterations, `last` is the last element of the updated `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` will be the total number of iterations the loop ran, which must be greater than 2.
- The variable `i` will be the last iteration index, which is `t - 1`.
- The variable `n` will be the last integer input provided during any of the iterations.
- The variable `ls` will be a list of strings, with elements being removed in each iteration based on the input provided.
- The variable `last` will be the last remaining element in the list `ls`, converted to an integer.
- The variable `other` will be the second largest element in the sorted version of the list `ls`.
