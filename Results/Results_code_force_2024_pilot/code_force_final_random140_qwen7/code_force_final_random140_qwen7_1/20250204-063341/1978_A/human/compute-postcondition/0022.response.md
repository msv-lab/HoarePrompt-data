Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of books, followed by another integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers representing the number of pages in each book. For each test case, it removes the last and the second largest page counts from the list, sums them, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it outputs the sum of the last and second largest page counts for each case.**
