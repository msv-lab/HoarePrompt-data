Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a set \( S \) with unique elements formed by adding the index \( i \) to each element \( a_i \) of the array \( a \), and then sorting this set in descending order to form the array \( b \).
2. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
3. Within each test case, the program correctly:
   - Reads the length \( n \) of the array \( a \).
   - Reads the array \( a \) and converts it into a list of integers.
   - Initializes an empty set \( st \).
   - Iterates through the array \( a \) and adds the value \( a_i + i + 1 \) to the set \( st \). This ensures that each element in the set is unique.
   - Sorts the set \( st \) in descending order.
   - Prints the sorted set \( st \).

Given the problem constraints and the steps taken by the program, the program correctly implements the required logic to generate the lexicographically largest possible array \( b \).

Correctness: **True**
