Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the required logic.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Inside the loop for each test case, the function `func_1()` is called.
   - The function `func_1()` initializes an empty set `st`.

3. **Inserting Elements into Set:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array, the program adds `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. This ensures that each element is unique because sets cannot have duplicate values.

4. **Sorting and Printing:**
   - The set `st` is converted to a list and sorted in descending order.
   - The sorted list is printed.

### Correctness Check

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Set Operations:**
   - The program correctly uses a set to ensure that each element added to the set is unique.
   
2. **Element Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates `arr[i] + i + 1` for each element before adding it to the set.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the set in descending order before printing, which is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - The problem asks for the lexicographically largest array `b`, but since the set inherently avoids duplicates and the sorting is done in descending order, the output will be the lexicographically largest possible array.

### Conclusion

Given that the program correctly handles the set operations, element calculations, and sorting, it meets the requirements of the problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
