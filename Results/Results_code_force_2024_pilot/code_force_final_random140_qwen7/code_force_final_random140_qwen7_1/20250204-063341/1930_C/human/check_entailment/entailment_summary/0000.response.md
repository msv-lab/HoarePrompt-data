Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing the lexicographically largest possible array \( b \) by performing specific operations on the input array \( a \).
2. The provided program correctly implements the logic to achieve this:
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the elements of the array \( a \).
   - It then constructs a set \( st \) where each element is the sum of the array element and its index plus one (\( arr[i] + i + 1 \)).
   - Since sets automatically handle uniqueness, and the elements are printed in descending order, the program ensures that the output is the lexicographically largest possible array \( b \).

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program correctly performs the required operations to generate the lexicographically largest array \( b \).

Correctness: **True**
