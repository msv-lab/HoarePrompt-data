### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the program. However, there is a subtle issue with the problem statement and the implementation that needs to be addressed.

1. **Problem Statement Analysis:**
   - The problem requires constructing the lexicographically largest array \( b \) by ensuring that each element in the set \( S \) is unique and sorted in descending order.
   - The set \( S \) is constructed by inserting \( a_i + i + 1 \) for each element \( a_i \) in the array \( a \).

2. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It uses a set to store unique elements \( a_i + i + 1 \).
   - The set is then sorted in descending order and printed.

3. **Key Issue:**
   - The original assessment assumes that the set inherently provides the lexicographically largest array. However, the set only ensures uniqueness, and the order of insertion does not guarantee the lexicographical order.
   - The problem requires selecting the maximum possible value for each operation to ensure the lexicographically largest result. The current implementation does not explicitly maximize the values during each insertion.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To achieve the lexicographically largest array, we need to ensure that the largest possible value is inserted into the set first. This can be achieved by sorting the array \( a \) in descending order and then performing the operations.

### Corrected Implementation:
```python
from typing import List

def func_1() -> None:
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort the array in descending order
    st = set()
    for i in range(n):
        st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)
    print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the original implementation does not ensure the lexicographically largest array \( b \). Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

**Final: False**
