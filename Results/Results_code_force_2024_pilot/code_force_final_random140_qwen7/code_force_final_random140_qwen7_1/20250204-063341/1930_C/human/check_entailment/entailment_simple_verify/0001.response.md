### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and operations performed by the program. However, there is a critical oversight in the analysis regarding the lexicographical order requirement.

1. **Set Operations:**
   - The program correctly uses a set to ensure that each element added to the set is unique.

2. **Element Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates `arr[i] + i + 1` for each element before adding it to the set.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the set in descending order before printing, which is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - The problem requires finding the lexicographically largest array `b`. The current implementation simply sorts the set in descending order, which does not guarantee the lexicographically largest array. For example, consider the input `[1, 1]`:
     - If `i=0` is selected in both operations, the set `st` would contain `{2}`.
     - If `i=1` is selected in both operations, the set `st` would also contain `{2}`.
     - Both outputs `[2]` are technically correct, but they are not lexicographically compared.

To achieve the lexicographically largest array, the program needs to maximize the elements in the set while ensuring the set remains unique. The current approach does not guarantee this.

### Correct Approach:
- Instead of just adding `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set, the program should aim to maximize the values in the set by carefully selecting `i` in each iteration.

### Example:
For the input `[1, 1]`:
- If `i=0` is selected in the first operation, the set `st` would contain `{2}`.
- If `i=1` is selected in the second operation, the set `st` would still contain `{2}`.
- To get the lexicographically largest array, we need to ensure that the set contains the maximum possible values. For example, if we select `i=0` in the first operation and `i=1` in the second operation, the set `st` would contain `{2, 3}`, and the sorted output would be `[3, 2]`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct but misses the crucial point about lexicographical order. The program does not guarantee the lexicographically largest array as required by the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
