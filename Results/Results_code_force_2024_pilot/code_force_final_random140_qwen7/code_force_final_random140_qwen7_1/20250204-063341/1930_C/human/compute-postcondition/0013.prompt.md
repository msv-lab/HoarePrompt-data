You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    st = set()
    for i in range(n):
        st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `st` is a set containing `n` elements, each element being one of the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value of `n`, indicating that all elements in the range of the loop have been processed. The set `st` will contain `n` unique elements, each of which is the sum of an element from the list `arr` and its index plus one (`arr[i] + i + 1`).
    print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))
    #This is printed: the n unique elements of st sorted in descending order
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives input through predefined constraints where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), each test case contains an integer `n` between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. It processes these inputs and returns a value based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
