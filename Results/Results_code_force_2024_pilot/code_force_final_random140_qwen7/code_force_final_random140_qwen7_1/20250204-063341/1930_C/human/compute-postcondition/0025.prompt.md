You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(sum, enumerate(map(int, input().split()), start=1)))
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    ans = [arr[0]]
    for x in arr[1:]:
        if x >= ans[-1]:
            ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        else:
            ans.append(x)
        
    #State: `ans` is a list containing all elements from `arr` after processing according to the given rules.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: what is printed (where what is printed is the elements of the list ans separated by spaces)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a` for each test case defined by `t`. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer in `a` is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns a result based on the processing of these lists for all test cases.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
