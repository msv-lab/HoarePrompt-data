Output State: **`ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends the value of the last element of `ans` decreased by 1 to the list `ans`. Since the initial state specifies that `ans` contains either the first element of `arr` followed by `x` (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and less than `ans[-1]`), or the first element of `arr` with its last element decreased by 1 (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and greater than or equal to `ans[-1]`), the last element of `ans` is decreased by 1 and appended to the list. Therefore, the last element of `ans` is now one less than its previous value.
