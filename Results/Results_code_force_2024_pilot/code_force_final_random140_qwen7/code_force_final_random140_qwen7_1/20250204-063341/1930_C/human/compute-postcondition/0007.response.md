Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `st` contains the value `arr[3] + 4`
   - `n` must be greater than 2

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The variable `st` is derived from `arr[3] + 4` and does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2, but since no information suggests `n` changes within the loop, we assume `n` remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` becomes 4
   - `st` remains `arr[3] + 4`
   - `n` must still be greater than 2

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `st` contains the value `arr[3] + 4`, `n` must be greater than 2**
