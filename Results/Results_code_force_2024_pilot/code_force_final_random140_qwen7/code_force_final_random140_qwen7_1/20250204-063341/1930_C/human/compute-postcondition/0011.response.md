Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `st` is a set containing `n` elements, where each element is of the form `arr[i] + i + 1` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.

Since `st` is a set, it contains unique elements. The expression `arr[i] + i + 1` will generate a unique value for each `i` because `arr[i]` and `i` are distinct for different indices `i`. Therefore, `st` will contain `n` unique values.

When the `print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the set `st` sorted in descending order.

Output: **the n unique elements of st sorted in descending order**
