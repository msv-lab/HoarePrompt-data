Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives input through predefined constraints where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), each test case contains an integer `n` between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. It processes these inputs and returns a value based on the given constraints.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly accepts a series of test cases defined by the constraints mentioned, processes each test case, and returns a result for each one.
