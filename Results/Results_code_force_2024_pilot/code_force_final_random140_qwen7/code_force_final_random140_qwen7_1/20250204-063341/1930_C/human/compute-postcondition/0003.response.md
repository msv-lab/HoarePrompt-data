Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the loop head, but it will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is already given as an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. Specifically, we need to set `i` to 0 (the starting value) and ensure that `n` is within its valid range.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- `n` should be within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).

The other variables (`t`, `arr`, and `st`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 1 and 300000 inclusive**
