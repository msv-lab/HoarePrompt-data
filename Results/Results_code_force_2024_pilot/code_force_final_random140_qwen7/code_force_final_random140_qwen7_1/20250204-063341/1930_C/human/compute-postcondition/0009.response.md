Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `st` is a set containing `arr[i-1] + i` for every `i` from 1 to `n`.

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and the set `st` will contain the elements `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[1] + 2`, `arr[2] + 3`, ..., `arr[n-1] + n`.
