Output State: **`i` is 4; `st` contains the value `arr[4] + 5`;**

Explanation: The code `st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)` updates the set `st` by adding the value of `arr[i] + i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 4, the value added to `st` is `arr[4] + 5`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 4, and `st` now contains the value `arr[4] + 5`.
