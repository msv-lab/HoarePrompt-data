Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays**: The code sorts both arrays `a` and `b`. Sorting helps in efficiently finding the maximum differences between corresponding elements.

3. **Two Pointers Technique**: The code uses a two-pointer technique to compare elements from the sorted arrays `a` and `b`. It maintains pointers `a1` and `a2` for array `a` and `b1` and `b2` for array `b`.

4. **Difference Calculation**: For each pair of elements from `a` and `b`, the code calculates four possible differences:
   - `dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`
   - `dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`
   - `dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`
   - `dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`

5. **Max Difference Selection**: The code selects the maximum of these four differences and adds it to the answer. It then adjusts the pointers based on which difference was selected.

6. **Pointer Adjustment**: Depending on which difference was the largest, the code either increments or decrements the appropriate pointer to move towards the next pair of elements.

7. **Output**: After processing all pairs, the code prints the total difference `ans`.

Given the logic and the approach used, the code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem. It handles the sorting and the two-pointer technique appropriately to maximize the total difference.

Correctness: **True**
