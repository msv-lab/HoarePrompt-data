Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The code correctly initializes the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`. This part is correct.

2. **Sorting Arrays**: The code sorts both arrays `a` and `b`. Sorting is a good approach to efficiently find the maximum differences.

3. **Main Logic Loop**: The main logic involves iterating through the sorted arrays `a` and `b` to calculate the maximum possible differences. The algorithm attempts to maximize the differences by strategically choosing elements from `b` to match with elements from `a`.

4. **Differences Calculation**: The code calculates four possible differences (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) for each pair of elements from `a` and `b` and chooses the maximum among them. This approach ensures that the differences are maximized.

5. **Index Management**: The indices `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are managed correctly to ensure that the algorithm progresses through the arrays `a` and `b` in a way that maximizes the differences.

6. **Output**: The final result (`ans`) is printed correctly after processing all test cases.

Given the above points, the code appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem correctly. It handles the input, sorts the arrays, and uses a strategic approach to maximize the differences.

Correctness: **True**
