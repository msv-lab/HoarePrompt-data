Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `dif4`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2-1] - b[b2])`, `a2` is now `a2 - 1` for the loop to continue.**

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state, except for `a2` which is now one less than its previous value. The loop continues as long as `a2` is greater than `a1`.
