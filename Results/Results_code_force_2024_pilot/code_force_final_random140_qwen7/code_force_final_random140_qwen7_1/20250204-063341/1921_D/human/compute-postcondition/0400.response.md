To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head and ensure that the condition `a1 <= a2` remains true.

Given the conditions:
- If `dif1 > dif2`, then:
  - `ans` is 1, `b2` is either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and could be `a1 + 1`, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, and the condition `dif3 <= dif4` remains true.
- Otherwise, `ans` is either 0 + `dif3` or 0 + `dif4` or 1, `b2` is either `m - 2`, `m - 3`, or `m - 2`, `b1` is either 1 or 0 or 0, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and equals `a1 + 1` or remains the same or `a1 + 1`, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`.

The loop condition is `a1 <= a2`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a1` is still less than or equal to `a2` for the next iteration.

From the given conditions, we can see that:
- `a1` can potentially increase by 1 (if `a1` is within the range of list `a` and `a1` is incremented).
- `a2` can remain the same or decrease by 1.

For the loop to continue, `a1` should not exceed `a2`. Since `a1` can only increase by 1, we need to ensure that `a2` does not decrease below `a1` during the next iteration.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `a2` to ensure it remains greater than or equal to `a1`.

State: **`ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4`, `b2` is either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and could be `a1 + 1`, `a2` must be greater than or equal to `a1`, and `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`. `b` remains sorted throughout the process.**
