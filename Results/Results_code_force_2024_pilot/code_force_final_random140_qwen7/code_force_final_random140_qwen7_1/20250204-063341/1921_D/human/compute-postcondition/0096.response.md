Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

Explanation: The line `ans += dif1` increases the value of `ans` by the value of `dif1`. Since `dif1` is defined as the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `ans` is now increased by this value. All other variables remain unchanged.
