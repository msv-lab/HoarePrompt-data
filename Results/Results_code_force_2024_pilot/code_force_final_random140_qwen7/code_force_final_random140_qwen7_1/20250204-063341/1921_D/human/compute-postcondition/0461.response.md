Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif1`, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is `b1 + 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`**.

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `b1` is now `b1 + 1`, while `ans`, `a1`, `a2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their original values relative to their initial conditions.
