To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given postconditions.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while a1 <= a2:
```
This means the loop will continue as long as `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`.

### States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4`.
- The conditions for updating `ans` involve comparing `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`.

### Loop Head Variables
The only variables in the loop head are `a1` and `a2`.

### Analysis
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `a1 <= a2` must still hold true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` at the start of the next iteration.

### Adjustments Needed
- Since the loop continues as long as `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, we need to ensure that this condition holds true.
- We do not have any information about the values of `b1`, `b2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a1`, and `a2` from the previous iteration that would affect the loop condition directly.

### Conclusion
The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time is to ensure that `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`.

### Final Answer
State: **`ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`**
