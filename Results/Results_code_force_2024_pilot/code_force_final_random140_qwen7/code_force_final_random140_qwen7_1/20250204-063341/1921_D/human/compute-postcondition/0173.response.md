Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`; `b1` is 0; `b2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the list `b` is updated to be sorted, while all other variables retain their original values.
