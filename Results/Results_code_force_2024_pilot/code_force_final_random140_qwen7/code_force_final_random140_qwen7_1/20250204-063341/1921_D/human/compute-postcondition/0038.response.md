Output State: **`ans` is `dif4`, `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, and `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`, and `dif4` is greater than `dif1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif4` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif4`. Since `ans` was initially 0, after this line, `ans` will be equal to `dif4`. The other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged.
