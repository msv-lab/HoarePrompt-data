Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged.
