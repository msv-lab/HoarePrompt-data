Postcondition: `ans` is the accumulated sum of differences, `a1` and `a2` are adjusted according to the condition, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2 - 1]` (or `b[b2] - 1` depending on the path taken), `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. If `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, `ans` includes `dif4`, and `a2` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` includes `dif2`, and `a1` is incremented by 1.
