Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 + `dif3` or 0 + `dif4` or 1, `b2` is either `m - 2`, `m - 3`, or `m - 2`, `b1` is either 1 or 0 or 0, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and equals `a1 + 1` or remains the same or `a1 + 1`, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` (unchanged), `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` (unchanged), `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]` (unchanged), and `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `ans` will be updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4`. Depending on which condition is true, `b2` and `b1` may change, and `a1` might increment. The differences `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged unless `a1` changes, and `b` remains sorted throughout the process.
