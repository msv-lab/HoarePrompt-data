Output State: **`ans` is `dif3`, `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, and `dif3` is greater than `dif1`, and `dif3` is greater than `dif4`, and `a2` is decreased by 1; `b1` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. The other variables (`ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `a2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
