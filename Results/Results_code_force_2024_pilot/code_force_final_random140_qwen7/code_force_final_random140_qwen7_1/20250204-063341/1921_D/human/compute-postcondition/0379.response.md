Output State: **`ans` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b1` is 0, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` (unchanged), `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` (unchanged), `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]` (unchanged)**.

Explanation: The line `ans += dif2` increments the value of `ans` by `dif2`. Since `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]`, the new value of `ans` is `0 + dif2`, which simplifies to `1` because `ans` was initially `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
