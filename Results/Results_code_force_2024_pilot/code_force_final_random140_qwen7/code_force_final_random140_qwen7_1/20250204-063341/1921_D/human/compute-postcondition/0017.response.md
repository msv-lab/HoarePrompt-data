Output State: **`a1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is 0, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `a[a2]` (which is `a[n - 1]`) and `b[b1]` (which is assumed to be `b[0]` since `b1` is not defined) to `dif3`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
