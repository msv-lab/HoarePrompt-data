Output State: **`ans` is `dif3`, `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, and `dif3` is greater than `dif1`, and `dif3` is greater than `dif4`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif3` adds the value of `dif3` to `ans`. Since `ans` was initially 0, after this operation, `ans` becomes `dif3`. The other conditions and relationships between the differences remain unchanged.
