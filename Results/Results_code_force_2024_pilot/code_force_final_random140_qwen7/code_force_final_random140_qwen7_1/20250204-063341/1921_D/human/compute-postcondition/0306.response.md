Output State: **`a2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif4`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1 <= a2` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `a2` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their original relationships and values as described in the initial state.
