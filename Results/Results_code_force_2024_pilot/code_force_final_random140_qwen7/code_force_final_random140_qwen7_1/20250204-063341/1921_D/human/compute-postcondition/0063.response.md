Postcondition: **`a1`, `b2`, `dif1`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a2`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their values as per the conditions of the if-else block. If `dif3 > dif2`, then `b1` is increased by 1, `a2` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `dif3`, and other values remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `dif2`, and other values remain unchanged.**
