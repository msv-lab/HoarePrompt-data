Output State: **`ans` is 1, `b2` is `m - 2`, `b1` is 0, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 2]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 2]` and `b[b1]`, the condition `dif1 > dif2` is true, and the current value of `dif3` is greater than the current value of `dif4`.**

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. Since `a2` was initially `n - 1`, after decrementing, it becomes `n - 2`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
