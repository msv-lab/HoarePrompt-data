Output State: **`a2` is decreased by 1, `a2` is now one less than its original value, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is updated by adding `dif3` to its current value, `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue, `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.**

This means that `a2` has been decremented by 1, while the conditions and relationships involving other variables remain as described in the initial state.
