Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1 and is now either equal to `a2` or less than `a2`, `b1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2]).**

Explanation:
- `b1` is incremented by 1.
- `a1` remains either equal to `a2` or less than `a2`.
- `ans` is increased by `dif1`, which is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.
- `dif1` is updated to the new absolute difference between `a[a1]` (which has not changed) and `b[b1]` (which has increased by 1).
- `dif2` remains the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`.
- `dif3` is updated to the new absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.
- `dif4` remains the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.
