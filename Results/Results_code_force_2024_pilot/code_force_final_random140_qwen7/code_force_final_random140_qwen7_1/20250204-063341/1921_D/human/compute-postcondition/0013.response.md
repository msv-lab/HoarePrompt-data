Output State: **`a1` is 0, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` was originally a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. After sorting, `a` is now a list of these integers sorted in ascending order.
