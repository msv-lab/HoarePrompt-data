Postcondition: **`a1`, `b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are as follows: if `dif4` is greater than `dif1`, then `ans` is `dif4`, `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`, and `dif4` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `a1` is 1, `b1` is `m`, `ans` is `dif1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, and `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`.**
