Postcondition: **`dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, and `ans` is updated according to the following rules:**

- If `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, then:
  - If `dif3` is greater than `dif1`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`.
  - Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`, `a1` is incremented by 1, and `b1` is incremented by 1.
  - If `dif3` is not greater than `dif1`, and `dif4` is greater than `dif1`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` are updated accordingly.
  - Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`, `a1` is incremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly.

- If `dif1` is not greater than `dif2`, then:
  - If `dif3` is greater than `dif2`, `ans` is set to the maximum of `dif3` and `dif4`, `a1` is adjusted to either `a2 - 1` or `a1 + 1` depending on the comparison, `b1` is adjusted to either `b1 + 1` or `b2`, and `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are recalculated accordingly.
  - Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by the minimum of `dif2` and `dif4`, `a1` is adjusted to either `a1 + 1` or `a2`, and `dif2` is updated to either `b[b2] - 1` or `b[b2 - 1]` accordingly.
