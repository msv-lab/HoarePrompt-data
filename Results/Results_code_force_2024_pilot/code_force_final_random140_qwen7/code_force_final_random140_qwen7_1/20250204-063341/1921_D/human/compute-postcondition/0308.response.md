Output State: **`ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1 <= a2` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time.**

In this case, the code snippet `ans += dif2` updates the value of `ans` by adding `dif2` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
