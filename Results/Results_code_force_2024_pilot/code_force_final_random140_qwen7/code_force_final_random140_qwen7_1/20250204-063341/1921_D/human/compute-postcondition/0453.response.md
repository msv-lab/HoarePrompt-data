Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif1`, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a2` is unchanged, `b1` is `b1 + 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`**.

This means that `b1` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `ans`, `a1`, `a2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated based on their definitions. Specifically, `a1` is now one more than its original value, and `b1` is also one more than its original value. The differences (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`) are recalculated based on these new indices.
