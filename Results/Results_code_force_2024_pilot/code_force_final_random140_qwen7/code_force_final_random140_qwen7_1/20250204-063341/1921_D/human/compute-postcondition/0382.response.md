Postcondition: **`ans` is either 0 + dif3 or 1, `b2` is `m - 2`, `b1` is either 1 or 0, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and equals `a1 + 1` or remains the same, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` (unchanged), `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` (unchanged), `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]` (unchanged).**
