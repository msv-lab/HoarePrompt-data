Output State: **`ans` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b1` is 0, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` updated to `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]`, and the condition `dif3 <= dif4` is true, where `dif4` is greater than `dif1`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif4` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif4`. Since `ans` was initially 0, after executing this line, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
