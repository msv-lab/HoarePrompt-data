Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

Explanation: The line `ans += dif4` increments the value of `ans` by `dif4`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated by adding `dif4` to its current value. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are as defined in the initial state.
