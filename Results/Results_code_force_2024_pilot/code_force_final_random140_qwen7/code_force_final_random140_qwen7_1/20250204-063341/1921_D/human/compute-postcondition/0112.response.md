Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2` - 1, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2]); `b2` is decreased by 1.**

The code `b2 -= 1` decreases the value of `b2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous values.
