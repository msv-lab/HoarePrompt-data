Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `dif4`, `b2` is either `m - 4`, `m - 3`, or `m - 2`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and could be `a1 + 1`, `a2` is now `a2 - 1`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `b2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decreases the value of `b2` by 1. Since `b2` was originally either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, after the operation, `b2` will be one less than its original value, making it either `m - 4`, `m - 3`, or `m - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
