Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `ans + dif2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`, and `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif2`, and `dif1` is less than or equal to `dif2`, and `dif3` is greater than `dif4`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `dif3 > dif2` is true, then `a2` becomes `n - 2`, `b1` becomes 1, `ans` is incremented by `dif3`, and `dif3` is updated to be less than or equal to `dif2`, and `dif3` is still greater than `dif4`. If the condition `dif3 > dif2` is false, then `b2` becomes `m - 2`, `ans` is incremented by `dif2`, and `dif3` is updated to be less than or equal to `dif2`, and `dif1` is less than or equal to `dif2`, and `dif3` is greater than `dif4`.
