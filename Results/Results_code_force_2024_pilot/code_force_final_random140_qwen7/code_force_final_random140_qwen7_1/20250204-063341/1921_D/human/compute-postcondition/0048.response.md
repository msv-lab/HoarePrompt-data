Postcondition: **`a1`, `b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated as follows: if `dif3` is greater than `dif1`, then `ans` is `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `dif3` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. Otherwise, `a1` is set to 1, `b1` is set to `m`, `ans` is `dif1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, and `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`.**
