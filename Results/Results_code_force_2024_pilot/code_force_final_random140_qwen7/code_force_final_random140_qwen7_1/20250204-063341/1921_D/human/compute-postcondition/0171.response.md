Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`; `b1` is 0; `b2` is `m - 1`.**

The code `b2 = m - 1` assigns the value of `m - 1` to `b2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
