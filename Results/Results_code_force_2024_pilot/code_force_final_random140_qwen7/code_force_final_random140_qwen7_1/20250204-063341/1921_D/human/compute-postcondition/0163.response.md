The loop head is defined by the condition `t > 0`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `t`.

Given that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, and since no specific value of `t` was provided, we can only ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
