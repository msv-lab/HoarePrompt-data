Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `dif3` to its current value, `b2` is either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `b1` is 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and could be `a1 + 1`, `a2` is now `a2 - 1`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The variable `b1` is incremented by 1. Given that `b1` was either 0, 1, or 1 (which means it was originally 1), after the increment, `b1` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
