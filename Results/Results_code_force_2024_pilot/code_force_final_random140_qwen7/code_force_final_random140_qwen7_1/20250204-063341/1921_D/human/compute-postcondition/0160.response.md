Output State: All variables `a1`, `b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` will have been updated according to the logic within the loop for all iterations until `a1` exceeds `a2`.

To understand the final state, consider the following:
- The variable `a1` starts from 0 and increases or decreases based on the conditions inside the loop, eventually reaching a value where `a1 > a2`.
- The variable `b1` starts from 0 and increases or remains unchanged during each iteration, reflecting the comparison logic with `b2`.
- The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of certain differences (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) based on the conditions inside the loop.
- The variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` represent the absolute differences between elements of lists `a` and `b` at specific indices, which are recalculated in each iteration.

After all iterations, the final state will reflect the complete traversal of both lists `a` and `b` as per the given conditions, with `ans` containing the total accumulated sum of the specified differences.
