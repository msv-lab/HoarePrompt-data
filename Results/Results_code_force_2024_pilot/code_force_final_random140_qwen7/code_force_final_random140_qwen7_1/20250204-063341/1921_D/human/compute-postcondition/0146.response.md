Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `dif3`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is increased by 1, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2-1] - b[b2])`, `a2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
