Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif4`, `a2` is `a2 - 1`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2 - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `ans` remains `ans + dif4`, `a2` becomes `a2 - 1`, and `a1` is still less than or equal to `a2`. Additionally, `dif2` now represents the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2 - 1]` instead of `b[b2]`. The other differences (`dif1` and `dif3`) remain unchanged.
