Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `a2 -= 1` decreases the value of `a2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `a2` is now one less than its previous value, while `a1` still needs to be less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is still increased by `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif1` is still the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is still the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is still `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, and `dif4` is still `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.
