Output State: **`a2` is decreased by 1, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2-1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`**.

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. Since `b2` was previously referenced in the calculation of `dif2` (as `b[b2]`), it now becomes `b[b2-1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
