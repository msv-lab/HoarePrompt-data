Output State: **`ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, `a2` remains unchanged, `dif1` is recalculated as the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` remains unchanged, `dif3` remains unchanged, `dif4` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a1 += 1` increments the value of `a1` by 1. Since `a1` was previously used to index into arrays `a` and `b`, the value of `a1` changes, which affects the calculation of `dif1` (which is now the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`). The values of `a2`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the increment operation. The value of `ans` remains the same because no operation directly modifies it; it only depends on the values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`.
