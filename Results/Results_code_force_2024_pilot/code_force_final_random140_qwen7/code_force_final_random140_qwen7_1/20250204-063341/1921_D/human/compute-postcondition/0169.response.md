Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`.**

The code `a2 = n - 1` assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
