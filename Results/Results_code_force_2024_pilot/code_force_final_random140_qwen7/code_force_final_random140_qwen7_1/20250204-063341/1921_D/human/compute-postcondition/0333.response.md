Output State: **`ans` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b1` is 0, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` updated to `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`, list `a` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dif2` to be the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`. Since `b2` is `m - 1`, `dif2` becomes `abs(a[a1] - b[m - 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
