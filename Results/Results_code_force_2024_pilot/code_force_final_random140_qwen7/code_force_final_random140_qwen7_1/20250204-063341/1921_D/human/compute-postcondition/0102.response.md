Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
