Output State: **`a1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is `dif2`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`, and `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif2`.**

The value of `a1` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
