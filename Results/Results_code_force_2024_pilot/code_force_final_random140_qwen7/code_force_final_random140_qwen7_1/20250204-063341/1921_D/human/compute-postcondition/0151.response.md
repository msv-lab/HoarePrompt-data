Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `dif4`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif4` adds the current value of `dif4` to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given conditions.
