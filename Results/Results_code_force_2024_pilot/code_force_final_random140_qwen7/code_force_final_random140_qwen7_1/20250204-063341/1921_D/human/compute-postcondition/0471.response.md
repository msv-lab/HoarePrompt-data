Postcondition: `ans` is the accumulated result based on the following rules: if `dif3` is greater than `dif2`, then `ans` is set to `dif3`, and `a1` is adjusted to `a2 - 1` while `b1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif2`, and `a1` is incremented by 1. `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is updated accordingly, and `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` are recalculated as specified.
