The loop condition is `a1 <= a2`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `a1 <= a2` must be true at the beginning of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `a1` and `a2` are such that the loop has just completed an iteration. To ensure the loop executes again, `a1` must still be less than or equal to `a2`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `a1` to ensure it remains less than or equal to `a2`.

State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged**
