Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and `dif1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `a1` is incremented by 1. The values of `ans` and `dif1` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. `dif1` is still defined as the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, but since `a1` has been incremented, `a1` now refers to the next index in array `a`. All other variables retain their original conditions.
