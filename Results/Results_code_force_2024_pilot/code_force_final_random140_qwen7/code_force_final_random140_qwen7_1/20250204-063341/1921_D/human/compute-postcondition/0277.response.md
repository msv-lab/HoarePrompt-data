To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `a1 <= a2`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `m` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers
- `a1` is an index within the list `a`
- `a2` is an index within the list `a`
- `b1` is an index within the list `b`
- `b2` is an index within the list `b`
- `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences

The loop condition is `a1 <= a2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` at the start of the next iteration.

Since the only variables in the loop head are `a1` and `a2`, we need to ensure that `a1 <= a2` holds true for the next iteration.

Given the current state, `a1` and `a2` are indices within the list `a`, and the loop will continue as long as `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for these variables to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

However, since the problem asks us to provide the state after the adjustment, we should note that the values of `a1` and `a2` must remain such that `a1 <= a2` for the loop to proceed.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is an index within the list `a`, `a2` is an index within the list `a`, `b1` is an index within the list `b`, `b2` is an index within the list `b`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences, and `a1 <= a2` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time**
