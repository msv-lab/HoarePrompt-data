Postcondition: **`a1`, `b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated according to the following rules:**

- If `dif1 > dif2` and `dif3 > dif1`, then `ans` is set to `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `dif3` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.
- If `dif1 > dif2` and `dif3 <= dif1`, then `a1` is set to 1, `b1` is set to `m`, `ans` is set to `dif1`, `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `dif3` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, and `dif4` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`.
- If `dif1 <= dif2` and `dif3 > dif2`, then `b1` is increased by 1, `a2` is set to `n - 2`, `ans` is set to `dif3`, and other values remain unchanged.
- If `dif1 <= dif2` and `dif3 <= dif2` and `dif3 <= dif4`, then `a1` is set to 0, `b2` is set to `m - 3`, `ans` is set to `dif4`, and other values remain unchanged.
- If `dif1 <= dif2` and `dif3 <= dif2` and `dif3 > dif4`, then `a1` is set to 1, `b2` is set to `m - 2`, `ans` is set to `dif2`, and other values remain unchanged.
