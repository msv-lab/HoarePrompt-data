Output State: **`dif3` is equal to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is updated based on certain conditions involving `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue, `dif2` is calculated as `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `dif3` as the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. All other conditions and updates remain unchanged from the initial state.
