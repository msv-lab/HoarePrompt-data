Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif4`, `a2` is `a2 - 1`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.**

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `a2` is now `a2 - 1`, while `a1` is still less than or equal to `a2`. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` are also unchanged as they depend on the indices `a1`, `b1`, `b2`, and `a2`, which only `a2` has been modified.
