Output State: **`ans` is `ans` + `dif2`, `a1` is `a1` + 1, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2] - 1`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `dif2`, which was initially the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, now becomes the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2] - 1`.
