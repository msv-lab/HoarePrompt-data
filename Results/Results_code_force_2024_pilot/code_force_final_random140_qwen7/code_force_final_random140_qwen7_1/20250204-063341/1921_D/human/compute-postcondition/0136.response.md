Output State: **`a2` is now `a2 - 1`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed, `ans` is updated by adding `dif4`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `dif3` is equal to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`.**

This means that the value of `a2` has been decremented by 1. The conditions and relationships between the other variables remain as described in the initial state, with the exception of `a2` which is now one less than its previous value.
