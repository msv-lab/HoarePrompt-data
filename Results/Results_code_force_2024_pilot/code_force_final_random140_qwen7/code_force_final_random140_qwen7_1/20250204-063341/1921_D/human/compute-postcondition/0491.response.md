Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers n and m (with 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and the sum of m across all test cases not exceeding 2 ⋅ 10^5) and lists a_i and b_i (where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving specific ranges and lists of integers, and it processes these inputs to produce a result for each test case without needing the test cases to be explicitly passed as parameters.
