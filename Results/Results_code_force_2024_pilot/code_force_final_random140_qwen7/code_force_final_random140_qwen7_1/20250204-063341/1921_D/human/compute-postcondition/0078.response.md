Postcondition: **`a1`, `b2`, `dif1`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a2`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their values as per the conditions of the if-else block. If `dif3 > dif2`, then `b1` is increased by 1, `a2` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `dif3`, and other values remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `dif2`, and other values remain unchanged. If `dif3 <= dif4`, then `a1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 3`, `ans` is `dif4`, and other values remain unchanged.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, the values of `a1`, `b2`, `dif1`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a2`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` will be adjusted according to the conditions specified in the if and else parts. Specifically, if `dif3 > dif2`, certain adjustments are made to `b1`, `a2`, and `ans`. Otherwise, `a1` and `b2` are adjusted, and `ans` is set to `dif2`. Additionally, if `dif3 <= dif4`, different adjustments are made to `a1` and `b2`, and `ans` is set to `dif4`.
