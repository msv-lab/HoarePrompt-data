Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a1 = 0
    a2 = n - 1
    b1 = 0
    b2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    b.sort()
    a.sort()
    while a1 <= a2:
        dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
        dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
        dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
        dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
        if dif1 > dif2:
            if dif3 > dif4:
                if dif3 > dif1:
                    ans += dif3
                    a2 -= 1
                    b1 += 1
                else:
                    ans += dif1
                    a1 += 1
                    b1 += 1
            elif dif4 > dif1:
                ans += dif4
                a2 -= 1
                b2 -= 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif2:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif2
                a1 += 1
                b2 -= 1
        elif dif4 > dif2:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. After all iterations, the final values of `a1`, `b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` will be determined based on the logic inside the loop. 

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `a1`, `b1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans`. However, we can describe the state in general terms:

- `a1` and `a2` will be adjusted until `a1` exceeds `a2`.
- `b1` and `b2` will be adjusted based on the comparisons of differences (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`).
- `ans` will accumulate the sum of the maximum differences found during the iterations.

In summary, after all iterations, `a1` will be greater than `a2`, `b1` and `b2` will be adjusted accordingly, and `ans` will contain the accumulated sum of the maximum differences found during the loop's execution.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than 0, n is greater than or equal to 1, m is an input integer, a is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, b is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, a1 and a2 are indices within the list a such that a1 <= a2, b1 and b2 are indices within the list b such that b1 <= b2, ans is the sum of certain absolute differences calculated during the loop's iterations, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2].
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration of the loop, `b2` is `m - 3`, `b1` is `2` (if `dif3 > dif4` was chosen in the last iteration), `a1` is `a1 + 3` (since we executed the loop 3 times), `a2` is `n - 3`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the sum of the maximum differences found between elements of lists `a` and `b` as per the conditions specified in the loop. The indices `b1` and `b2` will have been adjusted according to the decisions made during the iterations, with `b2` being reduced by 1 for each iteration, and `b1` being incremented when appropriate. The values of `a1` and `a2` will also have been adjusted to reflect the number of iterations completed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
