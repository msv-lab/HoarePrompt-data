Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `dif1`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif1` updates the value of `ans` by adding the current value of `dif1`. The other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
