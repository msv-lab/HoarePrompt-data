Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `dif1`, `a1` is increased by 1 to `a1 + 1`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is increased by 1, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1 + 1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue.**

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2` is still valid. The new value of `a1` is `a1 + 1`. The other conditions and relationships between variables also remain valid.
