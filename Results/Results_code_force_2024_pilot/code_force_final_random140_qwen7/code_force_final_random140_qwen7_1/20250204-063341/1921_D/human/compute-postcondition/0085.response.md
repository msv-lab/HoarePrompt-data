Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is `ans + dif3`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

Explanation: The code `ans += dif3` increments the value of `ans` by `dif3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, and `ans` is now `ans + dif3`. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain as they were initially defined.
