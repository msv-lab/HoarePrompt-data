Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif2`, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`, and `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif2`, and `dif1` is less than or equal to `dif2`, and `dif3` is greater than `dif4`.**

Explanation: The value of `a1` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged according to the initial state.
