Postcondition: **`ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4`. If `dif1 > dif2`, then `ans` is 1, `b2` is either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and could be `a1 + 1`, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, and the condition `dif3 <= dif4` remains true. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0 + `dif3` or 0 + `dif4` or 1, `b2` is either `m - 2`, `m - 3`, or `m - 2`, `b1` is either 1 or 0 or 0, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and equals `a1 + 1` or remains the same or `a1 + 1`, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`. `b` remains sorted throughout the process.**
