Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`; `b1` is 0; `b2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` and `a2` are indices within the list `a`, `b1` and `b2` are indices within the list `b`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. If `dif1 > dif2`, then either `a1` and `a2` are adjusted to cover the first and second last elements of `a`, `b1` and `b2` are adjusted accordingly, and `ans` is updated to include `dif2`; or `a1` and `a2` remain as the first and last elements of `a`, `b1` and `b2` are adjusted to cover the first and second last elements of `b`, and `ans` is reset to 0. If `dif1 <= dif2`, then `ans` is either `dif3` or `ans + dif4`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is an index within the list `a`, `a2` is an index within the list `a`, `b1` is an index within the list `b`, `b2` is an index within the list `b`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences, where if `dif1 > dif2`, then `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif1` and either `a1` is incremented by 1 or `b2` is the index within the list `b` decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated by adding `dif4`; otherwise, if `dif3 > dif4`, then `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif3` and `ans` is updated by adding `dif4`; otherwise, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif2` and `ans` is updated by adding `dif2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is an index within the list `a`, `a2` is an index within the list `a`, `b1` is an index within the list `b`, `b2` is an index within the list `b`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. If `dif1 > dif2` and `dif3 > dif4`, then either `b1` is increased by 1 and `ans` is updated accordingly, or `a1` and `b1` are increased by 1 and `ans` is updated accordingly. If `dif1 > dif2` and `dif4 > dif1`, then either `b2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is updated accordingly, or `a1` is increased by 1 and `ans` is updated accordingly. If `dif3 > dif4`, `ans` is increased by `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1+1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`. If `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, and `dif3` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `b2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
