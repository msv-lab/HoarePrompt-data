Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, n is greater than or equal to 1, m is an input integer, a is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, b is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, a1 and a2 are indices within the list a such that a1 <= a2, b1 and b2 are indices within the list b such that b1 <= b2, ans is the sum of certain absolute differences calculated during the loop's iterations, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2].**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships among the other variables (such as their sorting status and index relationships) are preserved.
