Postcondition: **`t` will be 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of the maximum differences found between corresponding elements of the lists `a` and `b` over all iterations. The indices `a1` and `a2` will satisfy `a1 > a2`, and `b1` and `b2` will reflect the last adjustments made during the loop. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` will be the absolute differences calculated during the last iteration of the loop.**
