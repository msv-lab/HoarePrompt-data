Postcondition: `ans` is the accumulated result based on the following rules: if `dif3` is greater than `dif2`, then `ans` is set to `dif3`, `a1` is adjusted to `a2 - 1`, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` are recalculated accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif2`, `a1` is incremented by 1, and `dif2` is decremented by 1 while `dif1`, `dif3`, and other variables are recalculated accordingly.
