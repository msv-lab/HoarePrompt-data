Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

Explanation: The line `ans += dif2` increases the value of `ans` by the value of `dif2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
