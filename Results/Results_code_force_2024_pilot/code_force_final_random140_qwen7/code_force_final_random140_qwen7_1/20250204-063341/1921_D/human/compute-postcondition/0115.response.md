Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1 and remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `b2` is decreased by 1, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `b2`.
