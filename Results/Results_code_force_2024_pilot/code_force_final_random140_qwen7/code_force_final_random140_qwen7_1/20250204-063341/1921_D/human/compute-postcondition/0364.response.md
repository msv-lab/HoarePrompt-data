Postcondition: `ans` is 1, `b2` is either `m - 3` or `m - 1`, `b1` is either 0 or 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and equals to `a1 + 1` when the else part is executed, `a2` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` updated to `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]`, and the condition `dif3 <= dif4` is true.
