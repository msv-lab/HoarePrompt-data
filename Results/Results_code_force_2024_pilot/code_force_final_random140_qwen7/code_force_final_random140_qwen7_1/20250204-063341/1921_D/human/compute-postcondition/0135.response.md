Output State: **`dif3` is equal to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is updated by adding `dif4`, `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif4` updates the value of `ans` by adding `dif4`. All other variables remain in their previous states. `dif4` is defined as `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, and `b2` might be decreased by 1 depending on the condition in the else part of the loop.
