Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`**

Explanation: The code calculates `dif3` as the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` (which is `a[a2]` and since `a2` is `n - 1`, it's `a[n - 1]`) and the first element of list `b` (which is `b[b1]` and since `b1` is 0, it's `b[0]`). All other variables remain unchanged.
