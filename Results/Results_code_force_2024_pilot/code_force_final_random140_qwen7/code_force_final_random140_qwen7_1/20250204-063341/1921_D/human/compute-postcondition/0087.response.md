Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `b1` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans + dif3`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])**.

The value of `b1` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged according to their previous definitions. The conditions and relationships among the variables specified in the initial state still hold.
