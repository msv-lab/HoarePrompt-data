Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b1` is 0, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` (unchanged), `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` (unchanged), `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]` (unchanged), and `dif3` is greater than `dif4`.
