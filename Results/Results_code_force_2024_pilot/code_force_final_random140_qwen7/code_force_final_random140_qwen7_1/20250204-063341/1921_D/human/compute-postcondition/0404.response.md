Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4`, `b2` is either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and could be `a1 + 1`, `a2` must be greater than or equal to `a1`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `dif4` as the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `b1`, `a1`, or `a2`. The values of `b2` and `dif3` remain unchanged. `dif4` is now set to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.
