Postcondition: `a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated as follows: 
- If `dif3 > dif4`, then `ans` is updated by adding `dif3` if `dif3 > dif1` is true, otherwise it is updated by adding `dif1`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `dif4` and `dif1`.
- `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2]).
