Based on the initial state described, the variables `a1`, `b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` will be adjusted within the loop until `a1` becomes greater than `a2`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of the maximum differences found during the iterations.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` will contain the sum of the maximum differences found during the loop's execution.

Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated sum of the maximum differences found during the loop's execution)**
