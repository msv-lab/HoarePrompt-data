Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif1`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `b1` was initially set to 0 and is now incremented by 1, making `b1` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
