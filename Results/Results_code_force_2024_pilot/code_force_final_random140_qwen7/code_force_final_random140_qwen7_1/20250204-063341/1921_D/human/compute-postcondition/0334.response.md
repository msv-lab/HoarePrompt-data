Output State: **`ans` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b1` is 0, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` updated to `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`, list `a` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code updates `dif3` to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. Since `b2` was previously `m - 1` and `b1` was `0`, and now `b2` remains `m - 1` and `b1` remains `0`, the only change is that `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
