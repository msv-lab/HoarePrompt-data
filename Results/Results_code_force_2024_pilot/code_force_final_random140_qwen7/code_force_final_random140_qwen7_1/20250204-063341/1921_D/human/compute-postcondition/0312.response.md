Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is an index within the list `a`, `a2` is an index within the list `a`, `b1` is an index within the list `b`, `b2` is an index within the list `b`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `a1 <= a2` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. If `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1.
