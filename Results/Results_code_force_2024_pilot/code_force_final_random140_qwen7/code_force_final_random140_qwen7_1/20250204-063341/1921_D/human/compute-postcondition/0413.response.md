Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `dif4`, `b2` is either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and could be `a1 + 1`, `a2` must be greater than or equal to `a1`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif4` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `dif4` to it. The other variables (`b2`, `b1`, `a1`, `a2`, and `dif4`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
