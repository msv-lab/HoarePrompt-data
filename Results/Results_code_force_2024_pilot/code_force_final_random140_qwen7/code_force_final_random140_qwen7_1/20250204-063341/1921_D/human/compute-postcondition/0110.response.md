Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

Explanation: The code `ans += dif4` increases the value of `ans` by `dif4`. The other variables (`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`) remain unchanged from their initial states. `a1` is still less than or equal to `a2`, and `b1` and `ans` are also unchanged.
