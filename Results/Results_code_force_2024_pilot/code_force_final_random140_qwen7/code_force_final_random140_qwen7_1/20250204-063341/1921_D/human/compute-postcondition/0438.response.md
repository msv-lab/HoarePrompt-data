Postcondition: `ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif4` and `dif2`. If `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, `ans` is updated by adding `dif4`, `b2` is either `m - 4`, `m - 3`, or `m - 2`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and could be `a1 + 1`, `a2` is now `a2 - 1`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, and `b2` is decreased by 1. If `dif4` is not greater than `dif2`, `ans` is updated by adding `dif2` to its current value, `b2` is either `m - 4`, `m - 3`, or `m - 2`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a2` must be greater than or equal to `a1`, and `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.
