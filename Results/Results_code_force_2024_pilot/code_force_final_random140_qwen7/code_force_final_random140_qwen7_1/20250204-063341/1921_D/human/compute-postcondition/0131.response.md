Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `dif1`, `a1` is increased by 1, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue.**

Explanation: The code `a1 += 1` increments the value of `a1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `a1` is now one more than its previous value, while the conditions involving `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `dif2`, and `dif4` remain the same as before the increment.
