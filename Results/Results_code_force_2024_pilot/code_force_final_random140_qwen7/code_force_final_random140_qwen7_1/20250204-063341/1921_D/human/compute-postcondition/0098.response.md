Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1 and is now either equal to `a2` or less than `a2`, `b1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

Explanation: The value of `b1` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `a1` is still either equal to `a2` or less than `a2`, `b1` is now one more than its previous value, `ans` is still increased by `dif1`, and `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their previous definitions based on the updated values of `a1` and `b1`.
