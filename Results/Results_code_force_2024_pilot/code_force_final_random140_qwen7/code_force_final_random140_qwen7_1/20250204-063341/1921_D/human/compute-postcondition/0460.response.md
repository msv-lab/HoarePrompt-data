Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif1`, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`**.

Explanation: The value of `a1` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions. Specifically, `ans` is still `ans + dif1`, `a1` is now `a1 + 1`, and the condition that `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` remains unchanged. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are recalculated based on the updated value of `a1`.
