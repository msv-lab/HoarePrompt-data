Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is an index within the list `a`, `a2` is an index within the list `a` decreased by 1, `b1` is an index within the list `b` increased by 1, `b2` is an index within the list `b`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif3`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`**

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `b1` is now one more than its previous value.
