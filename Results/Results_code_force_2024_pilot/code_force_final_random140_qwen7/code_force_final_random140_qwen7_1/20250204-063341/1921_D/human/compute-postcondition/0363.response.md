Output State: **`ans` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b1` is 1, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` updated to `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The variable `b1` is incremented by 1. Initially, `b1` was `0`, so after executing `b1 += 1`, `b1` becomes `1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial states.
