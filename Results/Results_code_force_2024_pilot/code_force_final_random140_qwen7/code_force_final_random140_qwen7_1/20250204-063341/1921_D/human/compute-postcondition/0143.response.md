Postcondition: **`dif3`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif4`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, and `ans` are updated based on the following conditions:**
- If `dif3 > dif1`, then `a2` is decreased by 1, `a2` becomes one less than its original value, `b1` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated by adding `dif3` to its current value, and `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `dif1`, `a1` is increased by 1 to become `a1 + 1`, `b1` is increased by 1, and `b2` remains unchanged.
- If `dif3 > dif1`, then `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `b2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is updated by adding `dif4`, and `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `dif1`, `a1` is increased by 1 to become `a1 + 1`, `b1` is increased by 1, and `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1 + 1]` and `b[b2]`.
