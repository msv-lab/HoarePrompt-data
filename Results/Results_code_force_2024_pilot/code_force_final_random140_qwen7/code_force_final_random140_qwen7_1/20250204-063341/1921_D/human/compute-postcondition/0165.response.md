Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `n` and the second to `m`. The initial condition that `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1` remains unchanged.
