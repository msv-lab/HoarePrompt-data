Output State: **`ans` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b1` is 0, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`**.

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b`. This operation changes the order of elements in `b` but does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the values of `ans`, `b2`, `b1`, `a1`, `a2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. The only change is that `b` is now sorted.
