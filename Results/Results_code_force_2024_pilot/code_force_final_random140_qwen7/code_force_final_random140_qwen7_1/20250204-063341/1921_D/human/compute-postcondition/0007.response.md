Output State: **`a1` is 0, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

In this case, the code simply initializes `a1` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
