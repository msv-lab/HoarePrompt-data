Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is an index within the list `a`, `a2` is an index within the list `a`, `b1` is an index within the list `b`, `b2` is an index within the list `b`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `dif3` as the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `dif1`, and `dif2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
