Postcondition: `a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `dif3` (if `dif3 > dif1`) or `dif1` (if `dif3 <= dif1`), `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2]).
