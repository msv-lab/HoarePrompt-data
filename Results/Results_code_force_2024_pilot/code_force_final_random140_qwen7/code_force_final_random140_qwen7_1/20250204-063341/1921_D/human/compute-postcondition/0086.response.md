Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is `ans + dif3`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])**.

Explanation: The value of `a2` is decremented by 1. This affects the condition that `a1` should remain less than or equal to `a2`. All other variables (`b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) remain unchanged with their respective values or expressions.
