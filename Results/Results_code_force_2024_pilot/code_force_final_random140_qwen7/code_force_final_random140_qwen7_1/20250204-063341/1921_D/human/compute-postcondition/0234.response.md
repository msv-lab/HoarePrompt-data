Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`, and `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`. After the if-else block executes, if `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, then `b2` is `m - 2`, `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`, and all other variables retain their original values or conditions. Otherwise, `b2` remains `m - 1`, `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`, and all other variables retain their original values or conditions.
