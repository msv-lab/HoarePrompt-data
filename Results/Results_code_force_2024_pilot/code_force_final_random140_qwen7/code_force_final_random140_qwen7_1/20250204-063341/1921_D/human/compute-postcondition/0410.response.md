Output State: **`b1` is 2, `b2` is either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a2` must be greater than or equal to `a1`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is now `ans + dif1`.**

Explanation: The value of `b1` is incremented by 1. Since `b1` was initially either 0, 1, or 1 (which is essentially 1), after incrementing by 1, `b1` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
