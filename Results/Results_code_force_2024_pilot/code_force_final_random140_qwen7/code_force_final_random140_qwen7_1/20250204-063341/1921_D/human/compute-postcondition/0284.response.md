Output State: **`b1` is increased by 1, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`, `a1 <= a2-1` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers.**

In this output state, `b1` is incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
