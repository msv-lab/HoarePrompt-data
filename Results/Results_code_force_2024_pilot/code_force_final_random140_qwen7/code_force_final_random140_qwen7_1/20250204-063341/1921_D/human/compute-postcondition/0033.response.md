Postcondition: **`ans` is either `dif3` or `dif1`, depending on whether `dif3` is greater than `dif1`. If `dif3` is greater than `dif1`, `a2` is decreased by 1 and `b1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a1` is set to 1 and `b1` is set to `m`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a2`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) retain their original values or are updated according to the conditions specified in the if and else parts.**
