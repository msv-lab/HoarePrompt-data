Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 + `dif3` or 0 + `dif4` or 1, `b2` is either `m - 2`, `m - 3`, or `m - 2`, `b1` is either 1, 0, or 0, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and equals `a1 + 1`, `a1 + 2`, or `a1 + 1`, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` (unchanged), `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` (unchanged), `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]` (unchanged), and `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`.
