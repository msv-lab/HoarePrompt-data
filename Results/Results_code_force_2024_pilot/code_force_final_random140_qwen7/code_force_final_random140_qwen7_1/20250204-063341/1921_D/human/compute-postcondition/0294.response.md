Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1; `ans` is the sum of `ans` and `dif1`; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `b1` is increased by 1.**

This means that `b1` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `a1`, `ans`, and `dif1` remain as they were described in the initial state, with `dif1` being updated to reflect the new value of `b1`.
