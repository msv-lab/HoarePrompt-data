Output State: **`b1` is 2, `b2` is either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a2` must be greater than or equal to `a1`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is now `ans + dif1`.**

Explanation: The variable `b1` is incremented by 1. Since `b1` was initially either 0, 1, or 1 (which is redundant as 0 and 1 are the same), after incrementing, `b1` will be 1. However, since the exact initial value of `b1` was not specified, we keep it as `b1` is 2 (implying it was originally 1). The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state as no operations were performed on them.
