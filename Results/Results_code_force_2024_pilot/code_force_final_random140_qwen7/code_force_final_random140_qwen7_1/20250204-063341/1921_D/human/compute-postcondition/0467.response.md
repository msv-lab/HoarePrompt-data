Output State: **`ans` is `dif3`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` - 1, `b1` is `b1 + 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`**.

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `ans` remains `dif3`, `a1` is still less than or equal to `a2` - 1, `b1` is now `b1 + 1`, `dif1` is recalculated as the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` remains the same, and `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.
