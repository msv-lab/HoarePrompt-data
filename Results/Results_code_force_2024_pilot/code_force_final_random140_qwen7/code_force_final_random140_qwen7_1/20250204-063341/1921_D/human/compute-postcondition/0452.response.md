Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif1`, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a2` is unchanged, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`**.

Explanation: The code `a1 += 1` increments the value of `a1` by 1. Since `a1` was previously less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` remains unchanged. All other variables (`ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) retain their previous values.
