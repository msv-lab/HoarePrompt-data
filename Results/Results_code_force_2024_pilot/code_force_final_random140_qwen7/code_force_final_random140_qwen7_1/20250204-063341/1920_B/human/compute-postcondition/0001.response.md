Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. Since the actual input values are not specified, the output state simply describes that these variables now hold integer values from the input.
