Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` contains the value of `sums` appended with `sums`, `sums` is increased by `a[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` remains within the range 1 to `k`, and `sums` is increased by `a[i - 1]` before being appended to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` now contains the previous value of `sums` appended with the updated value of `sums`.
