Output State: **`sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`, `i` is at least 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2; `ans` now contains the value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The conditions and values of `sums`, `i`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
