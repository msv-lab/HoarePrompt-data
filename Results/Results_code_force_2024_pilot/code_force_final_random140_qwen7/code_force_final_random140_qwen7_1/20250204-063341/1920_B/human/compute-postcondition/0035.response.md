Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated according to the formula `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update, and `ans` has an additional element which is the updated value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since the initial state of `sums` is updated according to the given formula, the new value of `sums` is added to `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and the formula for updating `sums` remain unchanged from their initial state.
