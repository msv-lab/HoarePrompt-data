Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `sum1`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
