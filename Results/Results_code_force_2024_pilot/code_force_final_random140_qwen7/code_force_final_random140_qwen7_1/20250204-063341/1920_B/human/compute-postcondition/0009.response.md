Output State: **`sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `sums` is assigned the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 0. The values of `sum1` and `a` are not specified, so they remain as they are. The variable `x` is also not specified, so its value is used directly in the calculation.
