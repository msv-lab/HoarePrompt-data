Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is within the range 0 to `k`.
   - `ans` contains the value of `sums`.
   - If `i` is 0, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
   - If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. Otherwise, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should still be within the range 0 to `k`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `ans` will still contain the value of `sums` from the previous iteration.
   - The value of `sums` will depend on the conditions mentioned in the postcondition. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to specify the exact value of `sums` unless it changes based on the loop condition.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `ans` will still contain the value of `sums` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` contains the value of `sums`.**
