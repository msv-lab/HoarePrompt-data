Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the integers from the input, `n`, `k`, and `x` are replaced by the integer values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are replaced by the integer values from the input split by spaces, and the list `a` is updated to contain these integers in sorted order. The original values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are no longer relevant since they have been replaced by the input values.
