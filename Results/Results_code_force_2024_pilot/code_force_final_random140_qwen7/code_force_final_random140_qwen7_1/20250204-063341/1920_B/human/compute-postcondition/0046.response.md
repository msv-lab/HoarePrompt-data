Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be equal to `k + 1` after all iterations of the loop.
- `x` and `n` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `sums` will hold the final value after all updates based on the conditions provided in the loop.
- `ans` will be a list containing all the intermediate values of `sums` updated in each iteration of the loop, with `k + 1` elements.

The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value among all the intermediate values stored in the list `ans`.

Since the exact values of `x`, `n`, and the intermediate values of `sums` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `ans`.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of k+1 elements representing the intermediate values of sums after each iteration of the loop)**
