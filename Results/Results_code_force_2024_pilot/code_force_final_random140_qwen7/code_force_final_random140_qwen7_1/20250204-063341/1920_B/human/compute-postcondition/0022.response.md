Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `k` inclusive.

3. **Determine the Current Value of `i`:**
   - From the postcondition, we know that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `0` or `1`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `1` each iteration, if `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `1` at the start of the next iteration. If `i` was `1`, it will be `2` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to adjust the state of `i` to the next value it will take in the next iteration.
   - If `i` was `0`, it will become `1`.
   - If `i` was `1`, it will become `2`.

Given the above steps, we can conclude that the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- If `i` was `0`, it becomes `1`.
- If `i` was `1`, it becomes `2`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified (it could be `0` or `1`), we need to consider both possibilities. However, the key point is that `i` will increase by `1` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated according to the given conditions, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.**

If `i` was `1`, then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated according to the given conditions, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.**

To generalize, the state at the start of the next iteration can be expressed as:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated according to the given conditions, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.**
