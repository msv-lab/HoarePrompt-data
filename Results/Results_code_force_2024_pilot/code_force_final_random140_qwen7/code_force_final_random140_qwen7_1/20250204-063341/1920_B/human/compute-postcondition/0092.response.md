Postcondition: `i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list with one additional element. If `i` is 0, then the new element is `sums`, where `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0, then the new element is `sums`, where `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`, otherwise `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
