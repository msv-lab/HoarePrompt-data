Output State: **`sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `i` is at least 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
