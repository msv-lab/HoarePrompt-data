Output State: **`ans` contains the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value, `i` is within the range 0 to `k`, `i` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation does not change the value of `sums`, `i`, `k`, `n`, or `x`. It only adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Therefore, the updated state includes that `ans` now contains the value of `sums`, while the conditions on `i`, `k`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
