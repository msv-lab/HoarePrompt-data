Output State: **`i` is at least 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`, `ans` contains the value of `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` from the precondition, but since the code only appends the value without changing `sums` itself, the updated value of `sums` remains as `sums + a[i - 1]`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
