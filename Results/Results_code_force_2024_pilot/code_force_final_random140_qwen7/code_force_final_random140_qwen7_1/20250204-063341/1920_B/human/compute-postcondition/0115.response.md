Postcondition: `i` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. Otherwise, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `ans` still contains the value of `sums`.
