Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and typically represents the iteration count. However, since `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any meaningful state, we don't need to adjust its value.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. This input determines how many times the loop will run. Therefore, the key state to adjust is the input itself, which dictates the number of iterations.

3. **Initial State Provided**: The initial state provided is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` represents the number of test cases, and the loop will run exactly `t` times.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is within the specified range.
