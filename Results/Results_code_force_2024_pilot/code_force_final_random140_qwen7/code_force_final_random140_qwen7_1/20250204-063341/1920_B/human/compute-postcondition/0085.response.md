Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list with one additional element where the new element is `sums`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Since no other variables are affected, the ranges and values of `i` and `sums` remain unchanged except for the addition of `sums` to the list `ans`.
