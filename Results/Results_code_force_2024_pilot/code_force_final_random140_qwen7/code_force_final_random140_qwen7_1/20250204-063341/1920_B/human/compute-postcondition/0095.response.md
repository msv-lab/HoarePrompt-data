To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed on the variables step by step.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is within the range 0 to `k`.
   - `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements.
   - `sums` is initially set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` when `i` is 0.
   - For subsequent iterations, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value.
   - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value.

2. **Operations**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = k`.
   - In each iteration, `sums` is updated based on the conditions provided.

3. **Final Step**:
   - After all iterations, `ans` contains the values of `sums` after each iteration.
   - The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value among these `k + 1` elements.

Given this breakdown, the output will be the maximum value among the `k + 1` elements stored in the list `ans`.

Output: **max value among the k + 1 elements in ans**
