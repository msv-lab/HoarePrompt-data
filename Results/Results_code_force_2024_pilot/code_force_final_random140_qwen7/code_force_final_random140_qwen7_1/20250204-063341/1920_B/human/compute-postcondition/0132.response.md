Output State: **`ans` now contains the value of `sums`, `i` is at least 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
