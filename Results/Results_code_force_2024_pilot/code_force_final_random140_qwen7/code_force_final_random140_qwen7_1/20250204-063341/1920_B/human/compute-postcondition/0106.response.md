Output State: **`i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `ans` contains the value `sums`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is at least 1 but currently 0, and `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, these values remain unchanged. After executing the line `ans.append(sums)`, the list `ans` now includes the value of `sums`.
