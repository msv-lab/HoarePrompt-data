Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is at least 2.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` starts from at least 2 and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is at least 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
