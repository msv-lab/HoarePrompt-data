Output State: **`sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value, `i` is within the range 0 to `k`, and `i` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding the value of `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. The conditions on `i` (it is within the range 0 to `k`, not equal to 0, and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`) remain unchanged.
