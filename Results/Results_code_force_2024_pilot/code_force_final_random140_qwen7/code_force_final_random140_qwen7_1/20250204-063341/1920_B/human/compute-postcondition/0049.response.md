Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `x` and `n` remain unchanged, `sums` holds the updated value, `ans` contains the intermediate values up to the current iteration.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list `a`. The variables `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `sums`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
