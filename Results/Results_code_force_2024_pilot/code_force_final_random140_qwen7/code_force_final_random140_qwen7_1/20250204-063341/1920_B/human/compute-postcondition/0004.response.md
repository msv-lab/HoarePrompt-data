Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of the integers from the input, `n`, `k`, and `x` are replaced by the integer values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a`. Since `a` was initially a sorted list of integers from the input, after executing this line, `a` will be a reversed version of that list. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
