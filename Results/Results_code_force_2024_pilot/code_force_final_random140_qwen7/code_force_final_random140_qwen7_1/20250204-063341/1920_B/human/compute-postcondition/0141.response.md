Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k + 1`. The variable `ans` will be a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element represents the maximum value of `sums` calculated during each iteration of the loop. The final output of the program will be the maximum value found in the `ans` list, which corresponds to the best possible `sums` value after considering all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = k`.

In more detail, the `ans` list will contain the intermediate sums calculated for each `i` from 0 to `k` according to the rules specified in the loop. The final output printed by the program will be the maximum value among these intermediate sums, indicating the optimal result after processing all the given test cases.
