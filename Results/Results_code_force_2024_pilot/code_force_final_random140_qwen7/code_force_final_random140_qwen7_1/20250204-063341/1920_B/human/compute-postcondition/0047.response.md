Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for` loop:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
   ```
   The only variable involved in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. However, since it is a placeholder and does not hold any meaningful value (it is typically ignored), we do not need to consider it for state adjustments.

2. **Identify the variables that might change inside the loop**: The problem statement mentions that `x` and `n` are not modified within the loop. Therefore, these variables will remain unchanged.

3. **Identify the variables that are modified inside the loop**: The problem states that `i` will be equal to `k + 1` after all iterations, and `sums` will hold the final value after all updates. Additionally, `ans` will contain all intermediate values of `sums` updated in each iteration.

4. **Determine the initial state for the next iteration**: Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the number of iterations will be determined by the user input. Let's denote the user input as `m`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 after each iteration. If there are `m` iterations, `i` will be `m` after the last iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be `m + 1`.
   - `sums` will be updated in each iteration, and `ans` will store these intermediate values.
   - `x` and `n` will remain unchanged.

Given that the loop will run `m` times, where `m` is the user input, the state at the start of the next iteration (if there is one) would be:
- `i` is `m + 1`
- `x` remains unchanged
- `n` remains unchanged
- `sums` will be updated based on the current iteration
- `ans` will store the intermediate values of `sums`

Since we do not know the exact value of `m` from the given information, let's assume `m` is the user input `k + 1` (as per the problem statement).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x` and `n` remain unchanged, `sums` holds the updated value, `ans` contains the intermediate values up to the current iteration**.

However, since we need to provide a specific state format, we can represent it as follows:

State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x` and `n` remain unchanged, `sums` holds the updated value, `ans` contains the intermediate values up to the current iteration.**
