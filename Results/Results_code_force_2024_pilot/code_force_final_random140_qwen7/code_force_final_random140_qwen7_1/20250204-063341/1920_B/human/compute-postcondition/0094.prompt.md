Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `sums` holds the updated value, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is within the range 0 to `k`, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. Otherwise, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list. If `i` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is updated to contain the value of `sums` appended with `sums`, and `sums` is increased by `a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list with one additional element. If `i` is 0, then the new element in `ans` is `sums`, where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0, then the new element in `ans` is `sums`. Furthermore, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
