Output State: **`ans` now contains the value of `sums`, `i` is at least 1, `x` is any integer, `n` is any integer, and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and the condition `i + x - 1 >= n` remain unchanged.
