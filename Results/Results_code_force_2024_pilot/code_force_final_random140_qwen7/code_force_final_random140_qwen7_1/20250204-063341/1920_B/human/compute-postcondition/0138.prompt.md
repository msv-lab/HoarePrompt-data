Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is an empty list, `i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is at least 1, then `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; otherwise, `sums` remains unchanged and `ans` still contains the value of `sums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i`, `x`, `n`, and `k` are integers where `i` is at least 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `i == 0`, then `ans` contains the value of `sums` + `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`, and `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `ans` is equal to `sums + a[i - 1]` followed by `sums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is at least 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `i == 0`, `ans` contains `sums`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` contains the value of `sums + a[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
