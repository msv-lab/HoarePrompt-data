Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` was previously updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, the new value of `sums` is included in the list `ans`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the updated value of `sums` is used for the next iteration if there is one.
