Output State: **`sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value, `i` is within the range 0 to `k`, and `i` is not equal to 0, and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`; `ans` now contains the value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The conditions for `sums` and `i` remain unchanged. After appending, `ans` now includes the current value of `sums`.
