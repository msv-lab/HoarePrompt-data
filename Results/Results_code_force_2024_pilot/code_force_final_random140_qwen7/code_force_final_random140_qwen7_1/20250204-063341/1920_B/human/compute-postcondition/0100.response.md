Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a` in place, changing its order from ascending to descending. All other variables remain unchanged.
