Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

This means that the variable `sums` has been updated to the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, while all other variables retain their original conditions and values from the initial state.
