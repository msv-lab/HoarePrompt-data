Output State: **`sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value, `i` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and the value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `ans` now contains the value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `sums`, `i`, `x`, `n`, and the condition that `i + x - 1` is less than `n` remain unchanged. The only new information is that `ans` now includes the current value of `sums`.
