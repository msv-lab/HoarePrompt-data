Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `sums + a[i - 1]` followed by `sums`, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated state of `ans` includes its previous value `sums + a[i - 1]` followed by the current value of `sums`.
