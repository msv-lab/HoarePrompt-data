Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, `sums` is increased by `a[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` to it. The variable `i` remains within the range 1 to `k`, and `ans` still contains the value of `sums` before the addition.
