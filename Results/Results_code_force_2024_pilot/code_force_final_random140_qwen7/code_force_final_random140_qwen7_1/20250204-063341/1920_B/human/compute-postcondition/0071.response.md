Postcondition: `i` is within the range 0 to `k`, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. Otherwise, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value.
