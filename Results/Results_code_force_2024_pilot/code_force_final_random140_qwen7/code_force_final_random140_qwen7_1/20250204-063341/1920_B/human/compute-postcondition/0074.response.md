Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `sums` remains equal to its previous definition, which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. The list `ans` now includes the updated value of `sums`.
