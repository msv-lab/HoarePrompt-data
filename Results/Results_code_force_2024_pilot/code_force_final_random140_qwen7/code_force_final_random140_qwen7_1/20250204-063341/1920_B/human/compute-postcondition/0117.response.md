Postcondition: `i` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is at least 1, then `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; otherwise, `sums` remains unchanged and `ans` still contains the value of `sums`.
