Output State: **`sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value, `i` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and the value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**

This means that the `sums` variable is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. The conditions on `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
