Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` to it. The value of `i` is incremented by 2, but its new value is not specified. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`.
