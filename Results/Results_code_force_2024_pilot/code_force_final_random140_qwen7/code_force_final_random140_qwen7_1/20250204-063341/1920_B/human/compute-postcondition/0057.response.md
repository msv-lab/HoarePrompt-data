Output State: **`i` is within the range 0 to k, and the current value of `i` is 0; `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`**.

This means that the variable `i` remains unchanged and is still within the range 0 to k with its current value being 0. The variable `sums` is newly assigned the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. The other variables (`sum1`, `a`, and `x`) are not directly mentioned in the code snippet, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
