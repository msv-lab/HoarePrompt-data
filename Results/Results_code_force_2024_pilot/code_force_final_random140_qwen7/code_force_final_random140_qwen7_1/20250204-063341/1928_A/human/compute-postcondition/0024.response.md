Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial states**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the first integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer.
   - `b` is the second integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer.

3. **Condition for loop execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the first integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer.
   - `b` is the second integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer.

5. **Adjusting the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, after one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

6. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains the same: a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` remains the same: greater than 0.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `a` remains the same: the first integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer.
   - `b` remains the same: the second integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer, `b` is the second integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer.**
