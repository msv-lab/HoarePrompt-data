Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer, `b` is the second integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer, the input has been split into two integers and assigned to `a` and `b` respectively. If `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0`, or if `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`, then the program does not change the values of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
