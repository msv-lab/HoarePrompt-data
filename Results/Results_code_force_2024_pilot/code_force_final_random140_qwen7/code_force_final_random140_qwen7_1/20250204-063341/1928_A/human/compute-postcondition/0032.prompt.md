Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, then no changes are made. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and either `a / 2 == b` with `b` being odd, `b / 2 == a` with `a` being odd, or the condition `(a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0))` is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer, `b` is the second integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer. If the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` is true, the program performs some unspecified action. If the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` is false, the program also performs some unspecified action.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user. After executing the if-else block, if `a % 2 != 0` and `b % 2 != 0`, then the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0`, or if `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`, the values of `a` and `b` also remain unchanged. In all other cases, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
