Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer, `b` is the second integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer, the input has been split into two integers and assigned to `a` and `b` respectively.**

This means that the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` have been updated based on user input, while the conditions and values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged.
