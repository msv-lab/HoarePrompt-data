Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
