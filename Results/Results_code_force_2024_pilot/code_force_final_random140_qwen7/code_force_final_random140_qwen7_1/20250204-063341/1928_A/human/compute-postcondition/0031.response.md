Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user. After executing the if-else block, if `a % 2 != 0` and `b % 2 != 0`, then the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0`, or if `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`, the values of `a` and `b` also remain unchanged. In all other cases, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
