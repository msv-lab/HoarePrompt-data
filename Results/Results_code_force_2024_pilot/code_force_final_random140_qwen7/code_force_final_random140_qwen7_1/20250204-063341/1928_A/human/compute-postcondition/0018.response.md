Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer, `b` is the second integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The value of `i` remains 1 as the code does not affect it.
