Output: **NO**

Explanation: Based on the initial state described, `t` is a positive integer within the range of \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Variables `i`, `a`, and `b` are defined as follows: `i` is set to 2, `a` is the first integer entered by the user after conversion, and `b` is the second integer entered by the user after conversion. The `print('NO')` statement simply outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, or any other variables.
