Output: **NO**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, `t` is a positive integer within the range of \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Variables `i`, `a`, and `b` are defined such that `i` is set to 2, `a` is the first integer entered by the user after conversion, and `b` is the second integer entered by the user after conversion. However, these specific values do not affect the print statement `print('NO')`, which directly outputs the string 'NO'. Therefore, the output is simply 'NO'.
