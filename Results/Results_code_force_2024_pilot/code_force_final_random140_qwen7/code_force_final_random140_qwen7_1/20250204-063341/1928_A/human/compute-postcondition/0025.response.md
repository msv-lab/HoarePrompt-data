Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` is the first integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer
   - `b` is the second integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as no information suggests it should change.

5. **Final state**:
   - `t` remains the same (it is not part of the loop head).
   - `n` remains the same (it is not part of the loop head).
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same (they are not part of the loop head).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer, `b` is the second integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer**.
