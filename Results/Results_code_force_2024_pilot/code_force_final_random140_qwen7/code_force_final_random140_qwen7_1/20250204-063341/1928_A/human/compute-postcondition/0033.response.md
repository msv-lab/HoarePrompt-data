Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and potentially `t`.**

Given the constraints and the implied processing, the function likely iterates over multiple test cases, performing some operation involving `a`, `b`, and possibly `t`, and returns a result for each case. However, without more specific details on the operations, the primary description focuses on the nature of the input and output as described.
