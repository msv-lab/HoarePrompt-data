Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` must be 0
   - `a` is the first integer entered
   - `b` is the second integer entered
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, then no changes are made. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and either `a / 2 == b` with `b` being odd, `b / 2 == a` with `a` being odd, or the condition `(a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0))` is false.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop head only involves `i`, we need to update the value of `i` to `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `t`, `a`, `b` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

6. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` must be updated to `i + 1`, which means `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `t`, `a`, `b` remain the same.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered.**
