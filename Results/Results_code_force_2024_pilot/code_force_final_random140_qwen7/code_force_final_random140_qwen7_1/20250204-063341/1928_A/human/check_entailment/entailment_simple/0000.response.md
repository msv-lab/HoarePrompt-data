Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle allow for the formation of another rectangle through the specified operations. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case by reading the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Conditions for "NO"**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the program prints "NO". This is correct because cutting an odd-sized rectangle results in two smaller odd-sized rectangles, and no further transformation can produce a new rectangle.
   - If \(a / 2 = b\) and \(b\) is odd, or \(b / 2 = a\) and \(a\) is odd, the program also prints "NO". This condition checks if the rectangle can be split into two identical smaller rectangles where one dimension is half of the other, but this would result in two identical smaller rectangles that cannot form a new distinct rectangle.

3. **Condition for "YES"**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "YES". This means that the rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles in a way that allows forming a new distinct rectangle.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the conditions in the code are correctly implemented to determine whether a new rectangle can be formed. The logic ensures that if the initial rectangle cannot be split in a way that allows forming a new distinct rectangle, it will print "NO". Otherwise, it will print "YES".

Therefore, the given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
