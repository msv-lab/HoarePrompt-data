Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions for "NO" Output**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd.
     - If both dimensions are odd, it prints "NO". This is correct because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle without a 90-degree rotation.
   - The program also checks if either `a / 2` equals `b` and `b` is odd, or if `b / 2` equals `a` and `a` is odd.
     - If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO". This condition is incorrect because it does not cover all cases where a rectangle can be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.

3. **Conditions for "YES" Output**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES".
     - This means the program assumes that if the previous conditions are not met, a new rectangle can always be formed. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, a 2x2 rectangle can be split into two 1x2 rectangles, but those cannot form a new distinct rectangle.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: \(1 \times 1\)
  - Both dimensions are odd, so it correctly prints "NO".

- **Test Case 2**: \(2 \times 1\)
  - One dimension is even, so it should print "YES". However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" due to the incorrect condition check.

- **Test Case 3**: \(2 \times 6\)
  - One dimension is even, so it should print "YES". The program correctly prints "YES".

- **Test Case 4**: \(3 \times 2\)
  - Both dimensions are odd, so it should print "NO". However, the program incorrectly prints "YES" due to the incorrect condition check.

- **Test Case 5**: \(2 \times 2\)
  - Both dimensions are even, so it should print "YES". The program correctly prints "YES".

- **Test Case 6**: \(2 \times 4\)
  - One dimension is even, so it should print "YES". The program correctly prints "YES".

- **Test Case 7**: \(6 \times 3\)
  - Both dimensions are even, so it should print "YES". The program correctly prints "NO" due to the incorrect condition check.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle certain cases properly. Specifically, the conditions for printing "NO" are too restrictive and do not cover all scenarios where a new rectangle cannot be formed.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
