Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

2. **Key Conditions**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no new rectangle can be formed since cutting an odd-sized side results in two smaller odd-sized sides.
   - If one dimension is exactly twice the other and the smaller dimension is odd, no new rectangle can be formed because the only possible cut would result in two identical smaller rectangles.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks the following conditions:
     - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints 'NO'.
     - If one dimension is exactly twice the other and the smaller dimension is odd, it also prints 'NO'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the condition where both dimensions are odd.
   - The program correctly handles the condition where one dimension is exactly twice the other and the smaller dimension is odd.
   - The program correctly prints 'YES' for all other cases where a different rectangle can be formed.

Given the analysis, the program logic matches the problem requirements and correctly determines whether Bob can form a different rectangle.

Correctness: **True**
