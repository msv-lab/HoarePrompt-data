Reasoning:
The given program attempts to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from an \(a \times b\) rectangle by checking specific conditions related to the parity of \(a\) and \(b\). However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle. 

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Condition Check**: The program checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO', which is correct because if both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles will always result in at least one dimension being odd, and thus, no new distinct rectangle can be formed without a 90-degree rotation.

2. **Incorrect Conditions**: The second condition `elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0):` is flawed. This condition incorrectly assumes that if one dimension is exactly half of the other and the other dimension is odd, no new rectangle can be formed. This is not true. For example, a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be reformed into a \(4 \times 1\) rectangle.

3. **Missing General Case**: The program fails to handle the general case where either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. In such cases, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with at least one even dimension, allowing him to form a new rectangle.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, as this guarantees that Bob can always form another rectangle. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This version correctly identifies that if either dimension is even, Bob can form another rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, it correctly prints 'NO'.

Correctness: **False**
