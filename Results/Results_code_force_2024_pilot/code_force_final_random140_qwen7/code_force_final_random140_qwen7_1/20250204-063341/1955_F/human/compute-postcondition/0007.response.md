Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` (num_test_cases) must be greater than 1 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes four space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The initial state of `i` and `t` remains unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 still holds. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are now set to the integers entered by the user.
