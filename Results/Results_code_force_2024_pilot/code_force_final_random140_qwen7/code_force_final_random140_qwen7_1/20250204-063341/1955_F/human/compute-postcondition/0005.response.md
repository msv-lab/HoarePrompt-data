Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `t` (num_test_cases) must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `a` is the first integer input.
   - `b` is the second integer input.
   - `c` is the third integer input.
   - `d` is the fourth integer input.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `a // 2`: This is the integer division of `a` by 2.
   - `b // 2`: This is the integer division of `b` by 2.
   - `c // 2`: This is the integer division of `c` by 2.
   - `d // 2`: This is the integer division of `d` by 2.
   - `a % 2`: This is the remainder when `a` is divided by 2.
   - `b % 2`: This is the remainder when `b` is divided by 2.
   - `c % 3`: This is the remainder when `c` is divided by 3.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`: This expression evaluates to 1 if the sum of `a % 2`, `b % 2`, and `c % 3` equals 3, otherwise it evaluates to 0.

4. **Combining the Expressions:**
   - The sum `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` is the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2.
   - The term `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)` will contribute either 0 or 1 to the final result depending on the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final output will be the sum of the integer divisions plus the additional term based on the condition involving the remainders.

Given the initial state, the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(a // 2) + (b // 2) + (c // 2) + (d // 2) + int((a % 2) + (b % 2) + (c % 3) == 3)**
