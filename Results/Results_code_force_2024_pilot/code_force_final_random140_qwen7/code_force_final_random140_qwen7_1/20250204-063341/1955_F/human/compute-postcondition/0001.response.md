Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` (num_test_cases) must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` reads four space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and still holds the value 0. The variable `t` (num_test_cases) is not directly affected by this line of code, so its condition of being greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid.
