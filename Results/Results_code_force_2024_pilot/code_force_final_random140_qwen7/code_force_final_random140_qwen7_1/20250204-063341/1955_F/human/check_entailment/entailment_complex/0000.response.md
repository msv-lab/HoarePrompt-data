Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of times Bob can win. However, the logic used in the program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The winning condition is that Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero. Therefore, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

The program uses the formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)` to calculate the result. This formula does not accurately reflect the strategy to maximize Bob's wins. Instead, the correct approach would involve ensuring that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero by strategically removing numbers.

Given the complexity of the optimal strategy, the provided formula is incorrect and does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
