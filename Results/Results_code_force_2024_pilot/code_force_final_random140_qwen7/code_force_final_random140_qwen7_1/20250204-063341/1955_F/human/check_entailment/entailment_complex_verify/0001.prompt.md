You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i is a list of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, where 0 ≤ p_i[0] + p_i[1] + p_i[2] + p_i[3] ≤ 200.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `t` (the number of test cases), `t` (num_test_cases) is exactly `t`, and it is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the integers obtained from the last input before the loop ended. The output of the loop for each test case is calculated as `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from their final values during the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each represented by four non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which denote the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these counts using the formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`. After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.

2. **Objective**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining sequence is zero after each removal by Eve.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates the result using the formula: `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`.

4. **Formula Breakdown**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: This part counts the number of pairs of identical numbers (since each pair can be removed without changing the overall XOR value).
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`: This part checks if the sum of the remainders of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s is exactly 3, which indicates a specific condition where Bob can win.

### Verification Against Examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: 
     - Pairs: `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
     - Remainder check: `1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Result: `0 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation:
     - Pairs: `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
     - Remainder check: `1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 3 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`
     - Result: `1 + 0 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation:
     - Pairs: `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
     - Remainder check: `2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 3 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2`
     - Result: `3 + 0 = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation:
     - Pairs: `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
     - Remainder check: `3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 3 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`
     - Result: `3 + 0 = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation:
     - Pairs: `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
     - Remainder check: `0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 3 = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1`
     - Result: `12 + 0 = 12`
   - Output: `12` (Correct)
