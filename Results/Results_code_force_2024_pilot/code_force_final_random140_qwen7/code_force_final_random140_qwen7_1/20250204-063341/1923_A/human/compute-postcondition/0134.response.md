Postcondition: **`cnt1` is 2, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` retains its initial value based on the final count of 0s encountered in `arrs` except when `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0, `ans` retains its initial value based on the final `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` is decremented by the number of iterations which is `len(arrs)` and the current value of `t` is `len(arrs) - 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `arrs[idx] == 1` is true, then `cnt1` becomes 2, `idx` becomes 1, and `t` is decremented by `len(arrs)`, making the current value of `t` `len(arrs) - 1`. If the condition is false, the postcondition remains as per the initial state described in the precondition, with `cnt0` and `ans` retaining their initial values.
