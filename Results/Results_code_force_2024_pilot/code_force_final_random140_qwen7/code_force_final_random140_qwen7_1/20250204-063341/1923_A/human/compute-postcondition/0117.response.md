Output State: **`idx` is within the range `[0, len(arrs) - 1]` and equal to the previous `idx + 1`, `arrs` is a list of integers created from user input, and `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt0 += 1` increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. The condition that `idx` is within the range `[0, len(arrs) - 1]` and equal to the previous `idx + 1` remains unchanged, and `arrs` is still a list of integers created from user input. Therefore, the only change is that `cnt0` is now one more than its previous value.
