Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `cnt1` is either 1 or 0.
   - `idx` is 8.
   - `cnt0` is modified based on the condition: `cnt0 - 1` if `arrs[len(arrs) - 1]` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` is 0 if `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, and `ans` is `cnt0` if `cnt1` is either 5 or 4.
   - `t` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - Since `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, the condition for `ans` simplifies to `ans` being 0.
   - The value of `cnt0` depends on the last element of `arrs`. However, since `cnt1` is only 1 or 0, it does not affect the value of `ans`.

Given that `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, the value of `ans` will always be 0.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **0**
