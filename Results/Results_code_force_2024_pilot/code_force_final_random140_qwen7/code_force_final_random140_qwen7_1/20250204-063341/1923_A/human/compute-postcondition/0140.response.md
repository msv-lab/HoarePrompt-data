Output State: **`cnt1` is 4, `idx` is 3, `cnt0` retains its initial value, `ans` retains its initial value, `t` is `len(arrs) - 2`**

Explanation: The variable `cnt1` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 3 or 2 to 4. The other variables (`idx`, `cnt0`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
