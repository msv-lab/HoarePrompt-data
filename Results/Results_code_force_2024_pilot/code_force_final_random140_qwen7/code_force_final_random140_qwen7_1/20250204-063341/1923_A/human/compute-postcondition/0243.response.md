Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by t test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, each being either 0 or 1. The function returns a result for each test case indicating the presence of at least one chip in the cells.**

This means the function is designed to process multiple test cases, each containing information about a set of cells where some cells may contain chips. For each test case, it checks if at least one cell contains a chip and returns a result based on this check.
