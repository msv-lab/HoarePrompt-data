Output State: **`cnt1` is either 1 or 0, `idx` is 8, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from input, `cnt0` is 0, `ans` is 0 if `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, and `ans` is `cnt0` if `cnt1` is either 5 or 4, and `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `cnt0 = 0` sets the value of `cnt0` to 0. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `cnt1`, `idx`, `length`, `arrs`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
