Output State: `cnt1` is either 5 or 4, `idx` is 4, `cnt0` retains its initial value based on the final count of 0s encountered in `arrs` except when `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0, `ans` retains its initial value based on the final `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` is `len(arrs) - len(arrs)` which simplifies to 0.

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `idx` will be equal to the length of `arrs`, `cnt1` will be the total count of 1s in `arrs` (either 4 or 5 depending on whether the last element is 1), `cnt0` will retain its initial value as determined by the count of 0s in `arrs` under the specified condition, `ans` will retain its initial value based on `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` will be 0 since it is decremented by the length of `arrs` and then further decremented with each iteration until it reaches 0.
