Output State: **`arrs[0]` is not equal to 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `cnt0` is 1, and all other elements in `arrs` are as they were in the precondition.**

Explanation: The code increments `cnt0` by 1. Since `cnt0` was initially 0 (implied from the precondition), after executing `cnt0 += 1`, `cnt0` becomes 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged according to the initial state.
