Postcondition: `cnt1` is 2, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` retains its initial value based on the final count of 0s encountered in `arrs` except when `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0, `ans` retains its initial value based on the final `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` is decremented by the number of iterations which is `len(arrs)` and the current value of `t` is `len(arrs) - 1`.

This means that if `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `cnt1` becomes 2, `idx` becomes 1, and `t` is decremented by `len(arrs)`, making the new value of `t` `len(arrs) - 1`. The values of `cnt0` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial values based on the counts of 0s and 1s encountered in `arrs`. If `arrs[idx]` is not 1, the values of `cnt1`, `idx`, `t`, `cnt0`, and `ans` remain as they were before the if-else block executed.
