Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `idx` and `arrs`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range of the length of `arrs`. This means the loop continues as long as `idx` is less than the length of `arrs`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cnt0` is 1
   - `_` is 0
   - `length` is an input integer
   - `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element
   - `idx` is 0
   - Either the first element of `arrs` is 0 or the first element of `arrs` is 1

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the range of `len(arrs)`, at the end of the previous iteration, `idx` would have been incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if `idx` was 0 at the start of the previous iteration, it would now be 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must be less than the length of `arrs`. Given that `arrs` has at least one element, `idx` can be incremented to 1, and the loop will continue if there are more elements in `arrs`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `cnt0` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `_` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `length` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
   - `arrs` remains unchanged as it is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `idx` is now 1.
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `idx < len(arrs)` must hold true. Since `arrs` has at least one element, `idx` being 1 means the loop can continue if there are more elements in `arrs`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`cnt0` is 1, `_` is 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `idx` is 1, and either the second element of `arrs` is 0 or the second element of `arrs` is 1**.
