Output State: **`cnt0` is decreased by 1, `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs`, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in `arrs`, `ans` is either 0 (if `cnt1` is 0 or 1) or `cnt0` (if `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1), and `t` is decreased by 1, `arrs` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `arrs`. The other variables (`cnt0`, `idx`, `cnt1`, `ans`, `t`, and `length`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values, but `arrs` now holds the newly created list of integers.
