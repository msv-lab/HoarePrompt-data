Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `idx` and `arrs`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `arrs`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `idx` is less than the length of `arrs`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt0` is 2
   - `_` is 0
   - `length` is an input integer
   - `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element
   - `idx` is 1
   - The second element of `arrs` is set to 0

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `idx` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `idx` must be incremented to 2 (the next index).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `idx < len(arrs)`. Therefore, `idx` must be 2 for the loop to continue.
   - The list `arrs` must still have at least one element.
   - The second element of `arrs` is already set to 0, so no change is needed here.

5. **Final state**:
   - `cnt0` remains 2
   - `_` remains 0
   - `length` remains an input integer
   - `arrs` must still have at least one element
   - `idx` must be 2
   - The second element of `arrs` is set to 0

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`cnt0` is 2, `_` is 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `idx` is 2, and the second element of `arrs` is set to 0**.
