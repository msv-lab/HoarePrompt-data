Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is equal to `idx + 2`, and `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `cnt0` by 1. The value of `idx` is updated to `idx + 2`, but since the initial value of `idx` was not specified, we only note that `idx` is now `idx + 2`. The list `arrs` and the variable `cnt0` remain in their respective initial conditions except for the increment of `cnt0`.
