Postcondition: `cnt1` is either 5 or 4, `idx` is 8, `cnt0` is `cnt0 - 1`, `ans` retains its initial value based on `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` is 0, if `arrs[len(arrs) - 1]` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt1` is either 5 or 4, `idx` is 8, `cnt0` retains its initial value, `ans` retains its initial value based on `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` is 0.
