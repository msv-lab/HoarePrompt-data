Output State: `cnt1` is either 5 or 4, `idx` is 4, `cnt0` retains its initial value based on the final count of 0s encountered in `arrs` except when `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0, `ans` retains its initial value based on the final `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` is `len(arrs) - len(arrs)` which simplifies to 0.

This means after all iterations of the loop, `idx` will be equal to the length of `arrs` (since it increments with each iteration and the loop runs until `idx` equals `len(arrs)`), `cnt1` will be the total count of 1s in `arrs` (either 4 or 5 depending on whether the last element is 1 or 0), `cnt0` will retain its initial value determined by the count of 0s in `arrs`, `ans` will also retain its initial value based on `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` will be 0 since it starts as `len(arrs)` and decreases by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.
