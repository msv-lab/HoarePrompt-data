Output State: **`idx` is the length of `arrs`, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in `arrs`, the first element of `arrs` is 0, the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is decreased by 1 if the last element of `arrs` is 0, and `ans` is `cnt0`, and `cnt1` is neither 1 nor 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = cnt0` assigns the value of `cnt0` to `ans`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the value of `ans` is updated to `cnt0`, while all other variables remain in their initial states relative to the conditions given.
