Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, and `length` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `length = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `length`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the loop variable `_` is initialized to 0 but not yet modified by the code.
