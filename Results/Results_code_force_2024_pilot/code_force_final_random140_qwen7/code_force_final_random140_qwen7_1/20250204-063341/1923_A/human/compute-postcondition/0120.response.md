Output State: **`idx` is within the range `[0, len(arrs) - 1]` and equal to the previous `idx + 1`, `arrs` is a list of integers created from user input, and `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt0 += 1` increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. Since `idx` was previously equal to `idx + 1`, it remains unchanged. The list `arrs` and its creation from user input also remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `cnt0` being increased by 1 while keeping the other conditions and values intact.
