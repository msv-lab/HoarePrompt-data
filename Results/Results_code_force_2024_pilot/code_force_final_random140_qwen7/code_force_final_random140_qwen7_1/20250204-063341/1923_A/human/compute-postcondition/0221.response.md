Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `idx`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `idx` is less than the length of `arrs`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `cnt1` is either 2 if `arrs[1]` equals 1, or remains 1 if `arrs[1]` does not equal 1.

4. **Next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `idx` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `cnt1` will depend on the value of `arrs[2]`. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we do not need to change `cnt1` here.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `idx` will be 2.
   - `cnt1` remains unchanged based on the current value of `arrs[1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`idx` is 2, and `cnt1` is either 2 if `arrs[1]` equals 1, or remains 1 if `arrs[1]` does not equal 1.**
