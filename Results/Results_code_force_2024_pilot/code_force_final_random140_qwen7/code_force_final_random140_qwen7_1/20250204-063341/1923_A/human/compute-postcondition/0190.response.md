Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an integer and is equal to `idx + 1`, `cnt0` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the `cnt0` variable has been incremented by 1, while the `arrs` list and the `idx` variable, which was previously set to `idx + 1`, remain unchanged in terms of their specific values.
