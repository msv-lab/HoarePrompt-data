Output State: **`idx` is 0; `cnt1` is 1**

Explanation: The initial state has `idx` set to 0 and `arrs[idx]` equal to 1. The code increments `cnt1` by 1. Since `cnt1` was not initialized before, it starts from 0. After executing `cnt1 += 1`, `cnt1` becomes 1. The value of `idx` remains unchanged as the code did not affect it.
