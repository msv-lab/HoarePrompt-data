Output State: **`cnt1` is 3, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` retains its initial value, `ans` retains its initial value, `t` is `len(arrs) - 2`**

The code `cnt1 += 1` increments the value of `cnt1` by 1. Initially, `cnt1` was 2, so after executing this line, `cnt1` becomes 3. The values of `idx`, `cnt0`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
