Output State: cnt0 is 3, _, is 0, length is an input integer, arrs is a list of integers that must have at least one element, idx is equal to the length of arrs minus 1, and the second element of arrs remains 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `idx` will be equal to the length of the list `arrs` minus 1 because the loop increments `idx` for each iteration until it reaches the end of the list. The value of `cnt0` remains 3 as it was incremented three times according to the given conditions in the loop body. The other variables (`_`, `length`, and the elements of `arrs` except for the second one) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
