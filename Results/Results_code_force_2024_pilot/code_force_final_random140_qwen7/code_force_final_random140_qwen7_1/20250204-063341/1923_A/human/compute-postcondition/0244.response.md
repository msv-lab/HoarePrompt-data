Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a sequence of n binary values (0 or 1). For each test case, it counts the number of consecutive 0s between the first and last 1s in the sequence. If there is only one 1 or no 1s, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the count of consecutive 0s. The function outputs the result for each test case.**
