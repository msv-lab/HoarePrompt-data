Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `idx` will be equal to the length of `arrs`, and `cnt1` will be the total count of 1s in `arrs`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `idx` will have gone through every index in `arrs`, starting from 0 up to `len(arrs) - 1`. The variable `cnt1` will hold the total number of 1s found in the array `arrs` during these iterations.
