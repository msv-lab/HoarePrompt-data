Output State: **`cnt0` is 3, `_` is 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1, and `cnt1` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt1` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cnt0`, `_`, `length`, `arrs`, or `idx`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as in the initial state.
