Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `idx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `idx` is within the range of `len(arrs)`. This means `idx` should be incremented by 1 each iteration until it reaches the length of `arrs`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `cnt1` is 1 (this is a postcondition, meaning it holds true when `arrs[idx]` equals 1).

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `idx` will become 1.

5. **Check the postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - The postcondition `cnt1` is 1 when `arrs[idx]` equals 1.
   - Since `idx` is now 1, the postcondition will depend on whether `arrs[1]` equals 1.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `idx` is now 1.
   - The postcondition for `cnt1` remains the same, but it will only hold true if `arrs[1]` equals 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`idx` is 1, `cnt1` is 1 (if `arrs[1]` equals 1)**
