Output State: **`cnt0` is 0, `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs`, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in `arrs`, `ans` is either 0 (if `cnt1` is 0 or 1) or `cnt0` (if `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1), and `t` is decreased by 1, `arrs` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The line `cnt0 = 0` sets the value of `cnt0` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `cnt0` being set to 0, while `idx`, `cnt1`, `ans`, `t`, and `arrs` retain their initial conditions.
