Output State: **`cnt1` is either 1 or 0, `idx` is 8, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from input, `cnt0` is `cnt0 - 1` if `arrs[len(arrs) - 1]` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged, `ans` is 0 if `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, and `ans` is `cnt0` if `cnt1` is either 5 or 4, and `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from input and converts them into a list of integers named `arrs`. The initial values of `cnt1`, `idx`, `length`, `cnt0`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `cnt0` is updated based on the condition `arrs[len(arrs) - 1]` being 1 or not, and `ans` is set based on the value of `cnt1`.
