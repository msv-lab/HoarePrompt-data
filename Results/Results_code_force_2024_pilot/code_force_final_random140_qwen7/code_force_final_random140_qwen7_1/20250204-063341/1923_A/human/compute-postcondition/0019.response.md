Output State: **`cnt0` is 1, `_` is 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `idx` is 0, `arrs[0]` is equal to 0**.

Explanation: The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `_`, `length`, `arrs`, `idx`, and `arrs[0]` remain unchanged.
