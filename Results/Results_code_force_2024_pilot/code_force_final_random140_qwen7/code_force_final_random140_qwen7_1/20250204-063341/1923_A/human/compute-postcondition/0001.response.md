Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and we have read an input integer which is the number of test cases; each test case will involve an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and an array of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.**

This means that after executing the code `t = int(input())`, the variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, and we are ready to process each test case by reading the value of `n` and the array of integers for each test case.
