Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an index within the range of `arrs` and is equal to the previous `idx` plus 1, `cnt1` is the previous `cnt1` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `cnt1` by 1. Since `idx` and `cnt1` were previously defined, they retain their respective properties. `cnt1` is now one more than its previous value.
