Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `idx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range of the length of `arrs`, meaning `idx` will increment from 0 to `len(arrs) - 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arrs` is a list of integers.
   - `idx` is an integer and is equal to `idx + 1` (implying `idx` was incremented in the previous iteration).
   - If `arrs[idx]` is equal to 0, then the count of zeros (`cnt0`) is increased by 1.
   - If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, the value of `cnt0` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `idx` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration, `idx` should be `idx + 1`.
   - The value of `cnt0` remains unchanged unless `arrs[idx]` is 0, but since we are only adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time, we do not change `cnt0` here.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `arrs` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `idx` is incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `cnt0` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an integer and is equal to `idx + 2`, and `cnt0` remains unchanged.**
