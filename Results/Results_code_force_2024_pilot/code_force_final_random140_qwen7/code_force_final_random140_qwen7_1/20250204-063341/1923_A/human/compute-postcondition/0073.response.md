Output State: **`cnt0` is decreased by 1, `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs`, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in `arrs` and is either 1 or 0, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `cnt0`, `idx`, or `cnt1`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
