Output State: **`cnt0` is decreased by 1, `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs`, and `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in `arrs`. The last element of `arrs` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `cnt0 -= 1` decreases the value of `cnt0` by 1. The values of `idx` and `cnt1` remain unchanged, and the last element of `arrs` remains 0.
