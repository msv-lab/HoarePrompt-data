Let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. `idx` is the length of `arrs`. Since the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, and no other elements are specified, we can infer that `arrs` has at least two elements (0 and 0), making `idx` at least 2.
2. `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in `arrs`. Given that the only elements explicitly mentioned are 0, and no other elements are specified, `cnt1` must be 0.
3. The first element of `arrs` is 0, and the last element of `arrs` is 0. This confirms our assumption about the minimum size of `arrs`.
4. `cnt0` is decreased by 1 if the last element of `arrs` is 0. Since the last element is 0, `cnt0` is indeed decreased by 1. However, the initial value of `cnt0` is not provided, but it doesn't affect the final value of `ans` since `cnt1` is 0.
5. `ans` is determined as follows:
   - If `cnt1` equals 1 or 0, then `ans` is 0.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is `cnt0`.

Given that `cnt1` is 0, `ans` will be 0 according to the rules provided.

Therefore, the print statement will output 0.

Output: **0**
