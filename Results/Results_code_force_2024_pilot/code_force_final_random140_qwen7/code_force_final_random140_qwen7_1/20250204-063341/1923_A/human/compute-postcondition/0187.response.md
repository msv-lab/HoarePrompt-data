Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an integer and is equal to `idx + 1`, `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, while the lists `arrs` and the integer `idx` remain unchanged from their previous states, with `idx` being set to `idx + 1`.
