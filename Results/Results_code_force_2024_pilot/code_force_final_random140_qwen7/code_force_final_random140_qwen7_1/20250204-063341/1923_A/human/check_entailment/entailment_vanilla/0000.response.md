Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arrs` which represents the state of the cells (0 for free, 1 for chip).

2. **Counting Zeros (`cnt0`):**
   - The program attempts to count the number of zeros to the right of the first chip (if any).
   - This logic is flawed because it incorrectly counts zeros even when the first element itself is a zero, which should not be counted as part of the "middle" zeros.

3. **Counting Chips (`cnt1`):**
   - It correctly counts the number of chips in the array.

4. **Adjusting Zero Count:**
   - If the first element is zero, it subtracts one from `cnt0`. This adjustment is unnecessary and incorrect because it doesn't account for the correct position of the first chip.

5. **Determining the Answer:**
   - If there is only one chip (`cnt1 == 1`), the answer is 0.
   - Otherwise, the answer is assumed to be `cnt0`, which is incorrect due to the flawed counting of zeros.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the first chip.
2. Count the number of zeros to the right of this first chip until the next chip.
3. Sum these counts to get the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.

### Revised Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the index of the first chip
        first_chip_index = None
        for i in range(length):
            if arrs[i] == 1:
                first_chip_index = i
                break
        
        # If no chips, no operations needed
        if first_chip_index is None:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Count the number of zeros to the right of the first chip
        cnt0 = 0
        for i in range(first_chip_index + 1, length):
            if arrs[i] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(cnt0)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Finding the First Chip:**
   - We find the index of the first chip using a loop.

2. **Counting Zeros:**
   - We start counting zeros from the position right after the first chip until we encounter another chip.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - The count of zeros gives us the minimum number of operations needed.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis and the corrected approach, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
