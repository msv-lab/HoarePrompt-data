Reasoning:
1. The problem requires moving chips to the left to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them.
2. The annotated program attempts to solve this by counting the number of consecutive zeros (`cnt0`) between the first and last ones in the array.
3. The logic for determining the answer is flawed:
   - It incorrectly counts zeros even when the first or last elements are not ones.
   - It doesn't handle the case where the first or last elements are ones correctly.
   - It doesn't account for the possibility of multiple blocks of chips being separated by zeros.
4. The correct approach should be to find the maximum distance between consecutive ones and add one to it (since each move reduces the gap by one).

Given these points, the annotated program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
