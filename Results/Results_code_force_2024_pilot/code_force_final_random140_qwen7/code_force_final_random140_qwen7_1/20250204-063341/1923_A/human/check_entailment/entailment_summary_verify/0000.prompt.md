You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a sequence of n binary values (0 or 1). For each test case, it counts the number of consecutive 0s between the first and last 1s in the sequence. If there is only one 1 or no 1s, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the count of consecutive 0s. The function outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the logic for counting `cnt0` (the number of consecutive zeros) is flawed. Here’s an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

According to the problem description, the correct output should be `1`, because moving the chip in the 7th cell to the 5th cell will result in all chips forming a single block. However, the program incorrectly counts `cnt0` as `3` (for the three zeros between the first and last chips), leading to an incorrect output of `3`.

The program should focus on counting the number of gaps between consecutive chips, which is equivalent to the number of zeros between them. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the first and last positions of chips
        first_chip = None
        last_chip = None
        for i in range(length):
            if arrs[i] == 1:
                if first_chip is None:
                    first_chip = i
                last_chip = i
        
        # Calculate the number of operations needed
        if first_chip is not None and last_chip is not None:
            cnt0 = 0
            for i in range(first_chip, last_chip):
                if arrs[i] == 0:
                    cnt0 += 1
            print(cnt0)
        else:
            print(0)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.
