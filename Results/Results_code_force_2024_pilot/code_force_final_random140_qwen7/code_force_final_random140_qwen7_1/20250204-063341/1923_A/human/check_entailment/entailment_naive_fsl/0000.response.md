Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the logic for counting `cnt0` (the number of consecutive zeros) is flawed. Hereâ€™s an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

According to the problem description, the correct output should be `1`, because moving the chip in the 7th cell to the 5th cell will result in all chips forming a single block. However, the program incorrectly counts `cnt0` as `3` (for the three zeros between the first and last chips), leading to an incorrect output of `3`.

The program should focus on counting the number of gaps between consecutive chips, which is equivalent to the number of zeros between them. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the first and last positions of chips
        first_chip = None
        last_chip = None
        for i in range(length):
            if arrs[i] == 1:
                if first_chip is None:
                    first_chip = i
                last_chip = i
        
        # Calculate the number of operations needed
        if first_chip is not None and last_chip is not None:
            cnt0 = 0
            for i in range(first_chip, last_chip):
                if arrs[i] == 0:
                    cnt0 += 1
            print(cnt0)
        else:
            print(0)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.
