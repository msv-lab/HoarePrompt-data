### Reasoning

The original program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Counting of Zeros (`cnt0`):**
   - The program attempts to count zeros to the right of the first chip but does so in a flawed manner. It incorrectly counts zeros even when the first element itself is a zero, which should not be counted as part of the "middle" zeros.

2. **Unnecessary Subtraction (`cnt0 -= 1`):**
   - The program subtracts one from `cnt0` if the first element is zero. This subtraction is unnecessary and incorrect because it doesn't account for the correct position of the first chip.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Multiple Chips:**
   - The program assumes that the count of zeros (`cnt0`) is the correct answer if there are multiple chips. However, the correct logic involves counting the zeros between the first chip and the next chip, and summing these counts.

The corrected program provided above addresses these issues by:
1. Identifying the index of the first chip.
2. Counting the number of zeros to the right of the first chip until the next chip.
3. Summing these counts to get the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.

Given the analysis and the corrected approach, the original program is indeed incorrect.
