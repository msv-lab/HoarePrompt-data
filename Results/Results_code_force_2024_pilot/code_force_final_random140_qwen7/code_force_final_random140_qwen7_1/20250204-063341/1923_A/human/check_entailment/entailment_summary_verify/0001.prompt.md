You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a sequence of n binary values (0 or 1). For each test case, it counts the number of consecutive 0s between the first and last 1s in the sequence. If there is only one 1 or no 1s, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the count of consecutive 0s. The function outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arrs` which represents the state of the cells (0 for free, 1 for chip).

2. **Counting Zeros (`cnt0`):**
   - The program attempts to count the number of zeros to the right of the first chip (if any).
   - This logic is flawed because it incorrectly counts zeros even when the first element itself is a zero, which should not be counted as part of the "middle" zeros.

3. **Counting Chips (`cnt1`):**
   - It correctly counts the number of chips in the array.

4. **Adjusting Zero Count:**
   - If the first element is zero, it subtracts one from `cnt0`. This adjustment is unnecessary and incorrect because it doesn't account for the correct position of the first chip.

5. **Determining the Answer:**
   - If there is only one chip (`cnt1 == 1`), the answer is 0.
   - Otherwise, the answer is assumed to be `cnt0`, which is incorrect due to the flawed counting of zeros.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the first chip.
2. Count the number of zeros to the right of this first chip until the next chip.
3. Sum these counts to get the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.

### Revised Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the index of the first chip
        first_chip_index = None
        for i in range(length):
            if arrs[i] == 1:
                first_chip_index = i
                break
        
        # If no chips, no operations needed
        if first_chip_index is None:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Count the number of zeros to the right of the first chip
        cnt0 = 0
        for i in range(first_chip_index + 1, length):
            if arrs[i] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(cnt0)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Finding the First Chip:**
   - We find the index of the first chip using a loop.

2. **Counting Zeros:**
   - We start counting zeros from the position right after the first chip until we encounter another chip.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - The count of zeros gives us the minimum number of operations needed.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis and the corrected approach, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
