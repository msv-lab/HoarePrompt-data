You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (p, q, r) = map(int, line.split())
        q += r
        print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it updates the value of `p` by subtracting one-third of `q` (where `q` is initially the sum of the second and third integers of the test case, and then incremented by the third integer) from `p`. The final state of `p` is the initial value minus the cumulative subtraction across all test cases. The function prints the result of this calculation for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate participants based on their preferences.
   - Each tent can hold up to 3 people.
   - Introverts need a tent alone.
   - Extroverts need a tent with 2 others.
   - Universals can share a tent with anyone.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads input from standard input (stdin).
   - For each test case, it takes three integers \( p \), \( q \), and \( r \) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
   - It calculates \( q + r \) and assigns it back to \( q \). This means the number of extroverts and universals combined is considered together.
   - It then checks if the remainder when \( r \) is divided by 3 is less than \( r \). If true, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints \( p - q // 3 \).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for handling introverts is correct. Each introvert needs a separate tent, so \( p \) tents are needed for \( p \) introverts.
   - The logic for handling extroverts and universals is flawed. The code incorrectly combines the number of extroverts and universals and then checks a condition that does not correctly account for the distribution of people into tents.
   - The condition `r < q % 3` is not sufficient to determine the correct number of tents needed. It does not consider the optimal distribution of people into tents.

4. **Correct Solution Approach:**
   - Calculate the number of tents needed for introverts: \( p \).
   - Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. Since each extrovert needs a tent with 2 others, we need to find the minimum number of tents such that each extrovert gets a partner. This can be done by dividing the sum of extroverts and universals by 3 and rounding up.
   - The total number of tents is \( p + \lceil \frac{q}{3} \rceil \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, it is incorrect.
