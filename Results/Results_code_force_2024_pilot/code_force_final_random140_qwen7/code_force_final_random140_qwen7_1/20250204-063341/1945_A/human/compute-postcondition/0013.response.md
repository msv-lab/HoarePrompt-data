Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `p` will be an integer that started as a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) minus the total number of times `q // 3` was added across all iterations, and `q` will be the sum of all `q` values from each iteration. The value of `r` will be the sum of all `r` values from each iteration.

This means that for each line processed, `p` is decreased by one-third of `q` rounded down, and `q` and `r` are updated based on the current line's values before moving to the next line.
