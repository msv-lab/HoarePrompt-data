To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `line` is a valid line from standard input.
   - `p` is the first integer from `line`.
   - `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from `line` plus the third integer from `line`.
   - `r` is the third integer from `line`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])
   ```

Let's analyze the expression inside the `print` function:

- `q` is defined as the sum of the second and third integers from `line` plus the third integer from `line`. So, if the integers from `line` are `a`, `b`, and `c`, then:
  \[
  q = b + c + c = b + 2c
  \]
- The expression inside the `print` function is a tuple `(p - q // 3, -1)`.
- The condition `r < q % 3` determines which element of the tuple is selected. Here, `q % 3` gives the remainder when `q` is divided by 3.

Since `q = b + 2c`, the remainder `q % 3` can be either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the values of `b` and `c`.

- If `r < q % 3` is `True`, the element `-1` is selected.
- If `r < q % 3` is `False`, the element `p - q // 3` is selected.

Given that `q % 3` can be any value between 0 and 2, we need to consider the possible outcomes:

- If `r < q % 3` is `True`, the output will be `-1`.
- If `r < q % 3` is `False`, the output will be `p - q // 3`.

Since the exact values of `p`, `q`, and `r` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions.

Output: **-1 if r is less than the remainder of q divided by 3, otherwise p - q // 3**
