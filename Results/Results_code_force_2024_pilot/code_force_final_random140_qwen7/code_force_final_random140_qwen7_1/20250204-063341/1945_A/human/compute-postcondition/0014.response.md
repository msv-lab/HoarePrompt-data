Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, if the given values satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the function determines the validity of the test case and returns the result accordingly. If t (the number of test cases) is within the specified range, it processes each set of a, b, and c values; otherwise, it returns an error message indicating that the number of test cases is out of the allowed range.**
