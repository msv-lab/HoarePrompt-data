Output State: **`line` must be a valid line from standard input, `p` is the first integer from `line`, `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from `line`, and `r` is the third integer from `line`.**

Explanation: The code `p, q, r = map(int, line.split())` splits the line into individual strings based on spaces and converts them to integers. `p` is assigned the first integer, `q` is assigned the sum of the second and third integers, and `r` is assigned the third integer. The precondition that `line` must be a valid line from standard input remains unchanged.
