Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `line`. This means the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `line`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are lines available to read from standard input.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `line` must be a valid line from standard input.
   - The next line from standard input will be the current value of `line` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `line` must be a valid line from standard input (the next line from standard input).

Given the initial conditions:
- `p` is the first integer from `line`.
- `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from `line` plus the third integer from `line`.
- `r` is the third integer from `line`.

Since these values depend on the current `line`, they will be recalculated based on the new `line` in the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`line` must be a valid line from standard input**
