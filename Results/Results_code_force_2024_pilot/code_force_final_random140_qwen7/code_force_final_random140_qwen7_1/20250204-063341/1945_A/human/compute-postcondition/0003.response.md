Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `line` is a valid line from standard input.
   - `p` is the first integer from `line`.
   - `q` is the second integer from `line` plus the third integer from `line`.
   - `r` is the third integer from `line`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` function: `(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]`.
   - The expression uses a tuple `(p - q // 3, -1)` and selects one of its elements based on the boolean value of `r < q % 3`.
   - If `r < q % 3` is `True`, the expression will select the first element of the tuple, which is `p - q // 3`.
   - If `r < q % 3` is `False`, the expression will select the second element of the tuple, which is `-1`.

4. **Determine the Value of `q % 3`:**
   - Since `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from `line`, let's denote these integers as `a` and `b` respectively. So, `q = a + b`.
   - The remainder when `q` is divided by 3, i.e., `q % 3`, can be either 0, 1, or 2.

5. **Evaluate the Condition `r < q % 3`:**
   - `r` is the third integer from `line`, so it is one of `a` or `b`.
   - Depending on the value of `q % 3`, the condition `r < q % 3` will be evaluated as follows:
     - If `q % 3 == 0`, then `r < 0` is always `False`.
     - If `q % 3 == 1`, then `r < 1` can be `True` if `r == 0` and `False` otherwise.
     - If `q % 3 == 2`, then `r < 2` can be `True` if `r == 0` or `r == 1` and `False` otherwise.

6. **Final Output Determination:**
   - If `r < q % 3` is `True`, the expression will evaluate to `p - q // 3`.
   - If `r < q % 3` is `False`, the expression will evaluate to `-1`.

Given the nature of the problem and the fact that `r` is one of the integers `a` or `b`, and `q` is their sum, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **p - q // 3 (if r is less than q % 3) or -1 (otherwise)**
