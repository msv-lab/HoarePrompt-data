Output State: **`line` must be a valid line from standard input, `p` is the first integer from `line`, `q` is the second integer from `line`, and `r` is the third integer from `line`.**

Explanation: The code splits the input line into three integers using `map(int, line.split())` and assigns them to `p`, `q`, and `r` respectively. The precondition that `line` must be a valid line from standard input remains true, and now `p`, `q`, and `r` hold the integer values from the split line.
