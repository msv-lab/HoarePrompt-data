Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `line`. This means the loop continues as long as there are lines available from the standard input.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as there are lines available in the file opened using `[*open(0)][1:]`. This means the loop will keep running until all lines have been read.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `line` must be a valid line from standard input.
   - `p` is the first integer from `line`.
   - `q` is the second integer from `line` plus the third integer from `line`.
   - `r` is the third integer from `line`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop reads lines from the standard input, the next line will be the current `line` for the next iteration.
   - `p`, `q`, and `r` will be updated based on the new line.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `line` will now be the next valid line from standard input.
   - `p` will be the first integer from the new `line`.
   - `q` will be the second integer from the new `line` plus the third integer from the new `line`.
   - `r` will be the third integer from the new `line`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`line` must be a valid line from standard input, `p` is the first integer from `line`, `q` is the second integer from `line` plus the third integer from `line`, and `r` is the third integer from `line`**.
