Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`.
   - It then reads `m` edges, each consisting of two vertices `u` and `v` and their weight `w`.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`).
   - Each edge is stored in a list (`edges`) along with its weight.

3. **Sorting Edges**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - A DSU data structure is used to keep track of connected components.
   - This helps in identifying cycles efficiently.

5. **Finding Minimum Weight Cycle**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges.
   - For each edge, it checks if the two vertices form a cycle by checking if they belong to the same component.
   - If a cycle is found, it records the weight of the edge and the starting and ending vertices of the cycle.

6. **Cycle Path Reconstruction**:
   - Using a breadth-first search (BFS), the program reconstructs the path from the starting vertex to the ending vertex.
   - The path is printed in reverse order to match the required format.

### Verification Against Problem Statement

1. **Test Cases Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over them.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is correctly represented using an adjacency list.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights, ensuring that the first cycle found will have the minimum weight edge.

4. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The use of DSU ensures efficient cycle detection.
   - The BFS correctly reconstructs the cycle path.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the required format: the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in traversal order.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately. The program correctly identifies a simple cycle with the minimum weight edge and prints the required output.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
