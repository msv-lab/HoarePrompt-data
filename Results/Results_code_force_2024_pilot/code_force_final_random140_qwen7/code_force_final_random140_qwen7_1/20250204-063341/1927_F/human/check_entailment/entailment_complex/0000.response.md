Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions**: The provided functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7`) correctly read input from standard input and process it as required by the problem description.
2. **Graph Construction**: `func_6` constructs the graph correctly using adjacency lists and initializes the DSU structure.
3. **Edge Sorting and MST Construction**: The edges are sorted in descending order of weight, and the DSU is used to detect cycles. The minimum edge weight in a cycle is identified.
4. **Path Finding**: A BFS is used to find the shortest path from a node to another node, ensuring the path is part of the cycle with the minimum edge weight.
5. **Output**: The function prints the weight of the minimum edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in traversal order.

Given the above points, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It handles the input reading, graph construction, cycle detection, and path finding as required.

Correctness: **True**
