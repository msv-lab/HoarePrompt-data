Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle in a graph where the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case appropriately.
2. **Graph Representation**: It uses an adjacency list (`defaultdict(list)`) to represent the graph and stores edges in a list.
3. **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights. This ensures that when we process the edges, we prioritize heavier edges first, which helps in finding cycles with lighter edges.
4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**: A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to detect cycles. When an edge connects two nodes in the same set, it indicates a cycle.
5. **Cycle Detection and Path Reconstruction**: Once a cycle is detected, the program reconstructs the path using a BFS approach, ensuring that the path is a simple cycle.
6. **Output**: The program outputs the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in traversal order.

The program handles all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement, making it correct.
