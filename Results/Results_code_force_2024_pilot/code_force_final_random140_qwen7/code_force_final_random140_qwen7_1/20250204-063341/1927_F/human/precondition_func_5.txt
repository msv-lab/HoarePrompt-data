n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, and graph is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. Additionally, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the weight of the edge and the two vertices it connects.
