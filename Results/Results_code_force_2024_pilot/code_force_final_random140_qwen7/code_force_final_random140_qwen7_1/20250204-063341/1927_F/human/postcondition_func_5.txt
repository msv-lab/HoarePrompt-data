The function constructs a graph using the given number of vertices, edges, and adjacency information. It then sorts the edges in descending order of weight and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find a minimum spanning tree (MST). After constructing the MST, it performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from a specified start node to an end node. Finally, it prints the weight of the last edge processed during MST construction and the length of the shortest path, followed by printing the shortest path itself in reverse order.
