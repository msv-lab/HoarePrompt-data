Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `nei` and the object `graph[node]`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `nei`: This variable will take on the values of the neighbors of `node` as the loop iterates.
   - `graph[node]`: This is a collection (likely a list or set) of neighbors of the node.

3. **Understand the loop condition and behavior**:
   - The loop will iterate over each neighbor of `node`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop will continue until all neighbors of `node` have been processed.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - Since `nei` is a variable that will take on different values during each iteration, we don't need to adjust its initial value.
   - We need to ensure that `graph[node]` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. If `graph[node]` is empty, the loop will not run.

5. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - After the loop, `que` should be a deque that does not contain the node that was first in the original deque.
   - `node` should be the element that was removed from the front of `que`.
   - If `node` equals `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- Ensure that `graph[node]` is not empty, so the loop can iterate at least once.
- `node` should be the element that was removed from the front of `que`.

Thus, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`graph[node]` must have at least one element, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`**
