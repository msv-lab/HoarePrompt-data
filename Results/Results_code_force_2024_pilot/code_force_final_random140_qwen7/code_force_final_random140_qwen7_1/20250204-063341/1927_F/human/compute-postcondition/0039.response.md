Output State: **`parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu`, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU object `dsu`, `w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge, `parent_v` is updated to the root of `v` found by `dsu.find(v)`**.

In this step, the code updates the value of `parent_v` to the root of `v` found by calling the `dsu.find(v)` method. The other variables remain unchanged.
