Output State: **`prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `nei` is not in `prev`; `que` contains `nei` added to it; if `node` equals `start` and `nei` equals `end`, we continue the loop or iteration.**

Explanation: The code snippet `que.append(nei)` appends the value of `nei` to the list `que`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition involving `start` and `end` continues the loop or iteration, which is noted in the output state.
