Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `node` will be a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary will be an empty collection. `prev` will contain mappings from each node reachable from `start` to the node that was traversed to reach it. `que` will be an empty deque.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, the variable `node` will no longer be used to traverse any more nodes since the loop will stop when there are no more neighbors in the graph for the current `node`. The `prev` dictionary will map every node that can be reached from the starting node (`start`) to the node that was traversed to reach it. The `que` will be empty because all nodes that could potentially be added to it have been processed.
