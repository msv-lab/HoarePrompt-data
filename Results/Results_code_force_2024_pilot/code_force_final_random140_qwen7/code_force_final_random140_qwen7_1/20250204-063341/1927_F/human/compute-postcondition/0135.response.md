Output State: **`prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `graph[node]` has at least one element; `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`; `que` now contains `nei` as its last element; `nei` is not in `prev`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `que.append(nei)` appends the value of `nei` to the end of the list `que`. This means that `nei` is added as the last element in the queue. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
