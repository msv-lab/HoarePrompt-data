Postcondition: `que` is a deque with one less element than before, `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`), `nei` is the next neighbor being processed, and `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`. This holds true whether `node` is the `start` and `nei` is the `end`, or in any other case where the else part does not apply.
