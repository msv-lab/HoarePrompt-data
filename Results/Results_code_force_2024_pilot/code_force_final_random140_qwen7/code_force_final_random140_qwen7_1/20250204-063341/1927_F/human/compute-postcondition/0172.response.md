The function `func_6` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `graph`. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `m` is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, and `graph` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. Additionally, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the weight of the edge and the two vertices it connects.

The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but it processes the graph and its edges based on the provided parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `graph`, and processes the graph based on the number of vertices, number of edges, and the adjacency information provided.**
