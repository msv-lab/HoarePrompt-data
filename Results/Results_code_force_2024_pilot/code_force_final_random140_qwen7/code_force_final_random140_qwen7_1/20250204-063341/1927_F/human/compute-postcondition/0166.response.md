Output State: **`que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, `curr` must not be equal to -1, and `path` now includes the node `curr` and the new value of `path` is `[node, curr]`**.

This means that the `path` list has been updated to include the new node `curr`, making the path from the start node to the current node. All other variables remain in their original state except for `path`, which now contains both `node` and `curr`.
