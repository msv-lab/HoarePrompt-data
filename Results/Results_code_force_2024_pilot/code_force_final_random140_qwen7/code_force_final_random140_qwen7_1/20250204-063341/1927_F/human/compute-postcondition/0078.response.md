Postcondition: `node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `nei` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `nei` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `prev[nei]` is now assigned the value of `node`; `que` contains `nei` and `nei` added to it; `nei` is now the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary. This remains true whether `node` equals `start` and `nei` equals `end`, or not. If `nei` is not already in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.
