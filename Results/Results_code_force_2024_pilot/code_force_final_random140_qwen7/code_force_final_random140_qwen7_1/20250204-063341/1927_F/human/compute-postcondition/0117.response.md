Output State: **`que` is a deque with one less element than before, `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`), `nei` is the next neighbor being processed, and `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`.**

Explanation: The line `prev[nei] = node` updates the `prev` dictionary such that the key `nei` now maps to the value `node`. The other variables (`que`, `node`, `nei`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
