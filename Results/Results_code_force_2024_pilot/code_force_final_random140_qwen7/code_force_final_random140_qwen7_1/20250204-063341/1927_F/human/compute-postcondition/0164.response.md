Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `curr != -1`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `que` is an empty deque.
   - `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty.
   - `prev` is a dictionary containing the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`.
   - `curr` is updated to the predecessor of `curr` in the shortest path tree.
   - `path` now includes the node `curr`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `curr` must not be `-1`. 

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `que` is already empty and `node` is the last node processed, these states do not affect the loop condition.
   - The key state to adjust is `curr`. For the loop to continue, `curr` must not be `-1`. This means `curr` should be set to a valid node (i.e., not `-1`).

5. **Final State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `curr` to ensure it is not `-1`.

Therefore, the state at the end of the current iteration, ready for the next iteration, is:

**State: `que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, `curr` must not be -1, and `path` now includes the node `curr`.**
