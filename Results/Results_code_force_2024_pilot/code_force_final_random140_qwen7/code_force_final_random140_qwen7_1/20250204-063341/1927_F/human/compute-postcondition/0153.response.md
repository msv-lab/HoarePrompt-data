Output State: **The queue `que` is empty, and `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty. The dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed, except for the `start` node which has no predecessor.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the queue `que` will be empty because every node that was initially in it has been processed. The variable `node` will hold the last node that was processed before the queue became empty. The dictionary `prev` will map each node (except the `start` node) to its immediate predecessor in the path from `start` to that node, forming a valid path through the graph.
