Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `m-1`. At this point, `i` must still be less than `m`. The variable `u` will hold the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration, `v` will hold the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration, and `w` will hold the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration. The `graph` dictionary will have updated its adjacency lists such that for every edge added, both vertices `u` and `v` will have each other in their respective adjacency lists. The `edges` list will contain tuples `(w, u, v)` for each of the `m` edges added during the loop's iterations.

In summary, the graph will be fully constructed with all `m` edges, and the `edges` list will contain all the weights and corresponding vertex pairs that were added during the loop's execution.
