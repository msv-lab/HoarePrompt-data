Output State: **`start` is `u`, `_min_edge` is `w`, `w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge, `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `u` to the variable `start`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the initial values of `_min_edge`, `w`, `v`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain unchanged.
