Output State: **`graph[node]` has at least one element remaining, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the statement itself, the values of `graph[node]`, `node`, and `nei` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions as the initial state.
