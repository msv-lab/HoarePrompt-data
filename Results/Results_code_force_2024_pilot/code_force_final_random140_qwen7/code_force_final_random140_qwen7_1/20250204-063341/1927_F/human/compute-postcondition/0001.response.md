Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0. Since the loop runs `test_cases` times, `test_cases` must be a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the State**: Given that `test_cases` is initially set by the function `func_1()` and the value is between 1 and \(10^4\), we need to ensure that `test_cases` is a positive integer for the loop to execute.

4. **Final State Adjustment**: The initial state is that `test_cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq test_cases \leq 10^4\) after calling `func_1()`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
