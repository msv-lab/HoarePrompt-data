Output State: **`prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `graph[node]` has at least one element, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, and the current value of `node` is either equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, or the loop continues without changing the values of `node` and `nei`. Additionally, `nei` is not in `prev`.**

This means that the variable `prev[nei]` now holds the value of `node`. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
