Output State: **`que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, `curr` is equal to `prev[curr]`, and `path` now includes the node `curr` with the updated value of `[node, prev[curr]]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to be the predecessor of the current `curr` as stored in the `prev` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
