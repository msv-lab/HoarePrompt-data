Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `que` is a deque with one less element, `node` is the first element that was removed from `que`, `prev` remains unchanged, and if `node` equals `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `que` is a deque with one less element. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` has the element `end` added to it, `node` is the first element that was removed from `que` and has the value `start`, `nei` is the value `end`, and `prev[nei]` is updated to `node`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `que` is a deque with one less element than before, `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`), `nei` is the value of `end` from the previous iteration, `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`, and `prev[nei]` equals `node`. This holds whether `nei` is not in `prev` or not, as the else part does not change the state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `que` is a deque with one less element than before, `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`), `nei` is the next neighbor being processed, and `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`. This holds true whether `nei` is not in `prev` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
