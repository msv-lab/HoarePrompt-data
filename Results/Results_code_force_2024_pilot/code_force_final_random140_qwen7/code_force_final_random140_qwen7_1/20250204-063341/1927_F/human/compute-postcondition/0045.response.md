Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `w`, `u`, and `v`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each edge `(w, u, v)` in the `edges` list.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - `w`: This is the weight of the current edge being processed.
   - `u`: This is one endpoint of the current edge.
   - `v`: This is the other endpoint of the current edge.

4. **Check the Conditions Inside the Loop**:
   - If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then:
     - `_min_edge` is set to `w`.
     - `parent_v` is updated to the root of `v` found by `dsu.find(v)`.
     - `start` is set to `u`.
     - `end` is set to `v`.
   - Otherwise, the union of `u` and `v` has been performed by `dsu.union(u, v)`, and `w` remains the weight of the next edge, `u` and `v` remain their respective endpoints.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is about to process the next edge, `w`, `u`, and `v` will be updated to the next values in the `edges` list.
   - The states of `parent_u`, `parent_v`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` are not directly adjusted by the loop itself but are determined based on the current edge being processed.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are simply the values of `w`, `u`, and `v` from the next edge in the `edges` list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge**.
