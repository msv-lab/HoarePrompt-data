Output State: **`que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, the variable `curr` is updated to the predecessor of `end` in the shortest path tree, and the final `node` equals `end`.**

Explanation: The line `curr = prev[curr]` updates the value of `curr` to the predecessor of the current `curr` (which is `end`) in the shortest path tree stored in the dictionary `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged.
