Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `prev` is a dictionary with `{start: -1}`, `que` is a deque containing `start`, `w` is the weight of the last edge processed, `u` is one endpoint of that edge, `v` is the other endpoint, `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`, the `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weights of the edges, the `graph` dictionary reflects the final adjacency list structure of the graph after all edges have been added and union operations have been performed, and we create a deque with `start` as its first element.
Code of the loop:
while que:
    node = que.popleft()
    if node == end:
        break
    for nei in graph[node]:
        if node == start and nei == end:
            continue
        if nei not in prev:
            prev[nei] = node
            que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `node` will be a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary will be an empty collection. `prev` will contain mappings from each node reachable from `start` to the node that was traversed to reach it. `que` will be an empty deque.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last element that was removed from `que` before `que` became empty, `prev` is a dictionary containing the shortest path from `start` to every node in the graph that was reachable within the given constraints, and if the final `node` equals `end`, the loop would have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The queue `que` is empty, and `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty. The dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed, except for the `start` node which has no predecessor.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
