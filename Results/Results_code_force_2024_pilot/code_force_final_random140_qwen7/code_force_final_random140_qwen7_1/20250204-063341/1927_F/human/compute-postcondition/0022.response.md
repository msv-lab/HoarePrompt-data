Output State: **_min_edge is positive infinity (float('inf')), dsu is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `i` is equal to `m - 1`, `i` is still less than `m`, `u` holds the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration, `v` holds the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration, `w` holds the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration, the `graph` dictionary has updated its adjacency lists such that for every edge added, both vertices `u` and `v` have each other in their respective adjacency lists, the `edges` list contains tuples `(w, u, v)` for each of the `m` edges added during the loop's iterations, the `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weight `w` of the edges.**

Explanation: The line `_min_edge = float('inf')` initializes `_min_edge` to positive infinity. All other variables and structures remain unchanged from their previous states.
