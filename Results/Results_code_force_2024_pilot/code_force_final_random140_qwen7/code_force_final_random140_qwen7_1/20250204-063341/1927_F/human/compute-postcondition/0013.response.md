Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `i` must be less than `m`
   - `u` and `v` are the values returned by `func_3()`
   - `w` is the same as before
   - `graph[u]` now includes `v` and `graph[v]` now includes `u`
   - `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)`
   - `edges` now includes the tuple `(w, u, v)` appended.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (assuming the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).
   - The value of `m` must remain the same as it was at the start of the current iteration because the loop condition is based on `i < m`.
   - `u` and `v` will be the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `w` will be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `graph[u]` and `graph[v]` will still include `v` and `u` respectively.
   - `edges` will include the tuple `(w, u, v)` from the previous iteration and will be updated with the new tuple if the loop body adds another edge.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `u` and `v` remain the same.
   - `w` remains the same.
   - `graph[u]` and `graph[v]` remain the same.
   - `edges` will include the tuple `(w, u, v)` from the previous iteration and will be updated if the loop body adds another edge.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `i` must be less than `m`, `u` and `v` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `w` is the same as before, `graph[u]` now includes `v` and `graph[v]` now includes `u`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)` and the tuple `(w, u, v)` appended.**
