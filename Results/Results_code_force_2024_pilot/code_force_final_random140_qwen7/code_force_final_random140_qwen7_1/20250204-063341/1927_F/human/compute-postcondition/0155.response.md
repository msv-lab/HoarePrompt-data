Output State: `que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, and the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`. If the final `node` equals `end`, the loop would have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. All nodes reachable from `start` are now in `prev`, with each node pointing to the node that was traversed to reach it. The `graph` dictionary reflects the final adjacency list structure of the graph after all edges have been added and union operations have been performed.
