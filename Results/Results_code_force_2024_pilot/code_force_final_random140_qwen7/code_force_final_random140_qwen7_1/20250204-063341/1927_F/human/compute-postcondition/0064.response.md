Output State: **`node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection. The current value of `node` is equal to `start`, and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `node` and `nei`, their values remain the same as they were in the initial state. The precondition that `node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary and its value is a non-empty collection also remains unchanged.
