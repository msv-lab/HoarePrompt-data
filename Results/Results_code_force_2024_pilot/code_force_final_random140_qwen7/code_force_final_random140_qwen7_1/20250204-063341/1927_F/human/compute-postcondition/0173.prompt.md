You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, and graph is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. Additionally, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the weight of the edge and the two vertices it connects.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `m-1`. At this point, `i` must still be less than `m`. The variable `u` will hold the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration, `v` will hold the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration, and `w` will hold the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration. The `graph` dictionary will have updated its adjacency lists such that for every edge added, both vertices `u` and `v` will have each other in their respective adjacency lists. The `edges` list will contain tuples `(w, u, v)` for each of the `m` edges added during the loop's iterations.
    #
    #In summary, the graph will be fully constructed with all `m` edges, and the `edges` list will contain all the weights and corresponding vertex pairs that were added during the loop's execution.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    start = -1
    end = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            _min_edge = w
            start = u
            end = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, meaning all `m` edges have been processed. At the end of the loop, `w` is the weight of the last edge processed, `u` is one endpoint of that edge, and `v` is the other endpoint. `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, and `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` is the weight of the last edge processed, `start` is `u`, and `end` is `v`. Otherwise, the union operation between `u` and `v` has been performed by `dsu.union(u, v)`, and the DSU structure reflects the union-find relationships among all nodes. The `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weights of the edges, and the `graph` dictionary reflects the final adjacency list structure of the graph after all edges have been added and union operations have been performed.
    que = deque([start])
    prev = {start: -1}
    while que:
        node = que.popleft()
        
        if node == end:
            break
        
        for nei in graph[node]:
            if node == start and nei == end:
                continue
            if nei not in prev:
                prev[nei] = node
                que.append(nei)
        
    #State: Output State: `que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, and the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`. If the final `node` equals `end`, the loop would have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. All nodes reachable from `start` are now in `prev`, with each node pointing to the node that was traversed to reach it. The `graph` dictionary reflects the final adjacency list structure of the graph after all edges have been added and union operations have been performed.
    path = []
    curr = end
    while curr != -1:
        path.append(curr)
        
        curr = prev[curr]
        
    #State: Output State: `que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, `curr` is equal to `prev[curr]` until `curr` becomes `-1`, and `path` is a list containing the shortest path from `end` to `start` in reverse order.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `path` will contain the entire shortest path from the `end` node back to the `start` node, listed from the `end` node to the `start` node. The `curr` variable will eventually become `-1` when there are no more predecessors to trace back, indicating that the shortest path has been fully constructed in the `path` list.
    print(_min_edge, len(path))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(path)
    print(*path[::-1])
    #This is printed: the shortest path from end to start
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `graph`, and processes the graph based on the number of vertices, number of edges, and the adjacency information provided.
