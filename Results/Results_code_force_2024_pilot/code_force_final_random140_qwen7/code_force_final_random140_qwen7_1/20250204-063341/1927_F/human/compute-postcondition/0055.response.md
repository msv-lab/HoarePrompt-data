Output State: **`que` is a deque containing `start`, `w` is the weight of the last edge processed, `u` is one endpoint of that edge, `v` is the other endpoint, `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`, the `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weights of the edges, the `graph` dictionary reflects the final adjacency list structure of the graph after all edges have been added and union operations have been performed, and we create a deque with `start` as its first element.**

This means that a deque named `que` has been initialized with the value of `start`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
