The only variable in the loop head is `curr`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `curr`. For the loop to execute the first time, `curr` must be different from `-1`.

Right before the loop, the state is as follows:
- `que` is an empty deque
- `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty
- The dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`.
- The variable `path` is an empty list
- `curr` is set to `end`
- The final `node` equals `end`, indicating the loop would have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.

For the loop to execute the first time, `curr` must not be `-1`. Since `curr` is initially set to `end`, and assuming `end` is not `-1`, no adjustment is necessary for `curr`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

State: **`que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, the variable `path` is an empty list, `curr` is set to `end`, and the final `node` equals `end`**
