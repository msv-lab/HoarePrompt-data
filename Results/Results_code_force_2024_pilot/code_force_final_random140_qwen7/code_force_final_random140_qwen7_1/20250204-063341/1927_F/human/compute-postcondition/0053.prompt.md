Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: end is -1, _min_edge is positive infinity (float('inf')), dsu is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `i` is equal to `m - 1`, `i` is still less than `m`, `u` holds the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration, `v` holds the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration, `w` holds the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration, the `graph` dictionary has updated its adjacency lists such that for every edge added, both vertices `u` and `v` have each other in their respective adjacency lists, the `edges` list contains tuples `(w, u, v)` for each of the `m` edges added during the loop's iterations, the `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weight `w` of the edges, start is -1.
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        _min_edge = w
        start = u
        end = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu` and `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU object `dsu`. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is `w`, `end` is `v`, and `start` is `u`. Otherwise, `parent_u` becomes the root of both `u` and `v` after the union operation, and `end` remains `-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu`, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU object `dsu`. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is `w`, `parent_v` is updated to the root of `v` found by `dsu.find(v)`, `start` is `u`, and `end` is `v`. Otherwise, the union of `u` and `v` has been performed by `dsu.union(u, v)` and `w` remains the weight of the next edge, `u` and `v` remain their respective endpoints.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge, `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then `start` is `u`, `_min_edge` is `w`, and `end` is `v`. Otherwise, the union operation between `u` and `v` has been performed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
