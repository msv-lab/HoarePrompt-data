Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `que` is now a deque that does not contain the node that was first in the original deque; `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`. If `node` equals `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `graph[node]` has at least one element, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, and `nei` is added to `que` as its last element. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `graph[node]` has at least one element remaining, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`, and `nei` is appended to `que`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `graph[node]` has at least one element remaining, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, and `prev[nei]` is either `node` or unchanged (if the condition `nei not in prev` is true, then `prev[nei]` is set to `node`; otherwise, no changes are made).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
