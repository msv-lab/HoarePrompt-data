Output State: **`que` is a deque with one less element than before, `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`), `nei` is the next neighbor being processed, and `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`.**

The `continue` statement in the code does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `que`, `node`, `nei`, and `prev[nei]` remain unchanged from their previous states.
