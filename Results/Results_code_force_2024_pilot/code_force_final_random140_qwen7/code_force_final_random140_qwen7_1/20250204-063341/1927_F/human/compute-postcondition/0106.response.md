Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is iterating over `nei` for each `node` in `graph[node]`. The relevant variables in the loop head are `node`, `nei`, and `prev`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `que` is a deque with one less element.
   - If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` has the element `end` added to it.
   - `node` is the first element that was removed from `que` and has the value `start`.
   - `nei` is the value `end`.
   - `prev[nei]` is updated to `node`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `node` is the first element removed from `que`, and `que` had one less element, `que` now has one less element than before.
   - `nei` is the value of `end`, which means `nei` is the neighbor of `node` in the graph.
   - `prev[nei]` is updated to `node`, meaning the previous node leading to `nei` is now `node`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values and the reduced size of `que`.

**State:**
- `que` is a deque with one less element than before.
- `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`).
- `nei` is the value of `end` from the previous iteration.
- `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`que` is a deque with one less element, `node` is the next neighbor of the current node in the graph, `nei` is the value of `end`, and `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`.**
