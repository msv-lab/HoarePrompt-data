Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( m \), followed by \( m \) lines of input. Each line contains three integers \( u \), \( v \), and \( w \), representing an edge between vertices \( u \) and \( v \) with weight \( w \). The function iterates through all test cases, and after processing, ensures that the number of test cases is at least 3. The function does not return any value.**
