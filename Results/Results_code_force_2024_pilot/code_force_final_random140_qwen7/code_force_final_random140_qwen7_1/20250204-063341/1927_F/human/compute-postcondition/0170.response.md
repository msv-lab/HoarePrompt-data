Based on the initial state provided:

- `que` is an empty deque.
- `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty.
- `prev` is a dictionary containing the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`.
- `curr` is set to `prev[curr]` until `curr` becomes `-1`, indicating that the shortest path has been fully constructed in the `path` list.
- `path` is a list containing the shortest path from `end` to `start` in reverse order.

Given this information, let's break down the print statement:

- `_min_edge` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it is not clear what its value is. Since it is not mentioned in the initial state and no calculation is shown for it, we cannot determine its value precisely. Therefore, we will leave it as `_min_edge`.
- `len(path)` refers to the length of the `path` list, which contains the shortest path from `end` to `start` in reverse order. Since `path` is constructed by tracing back from `end` to `start` using the `prev` dictionary, the length of `path` is the number of edges in the shortest path plus one (including the start node).

Thus, the print statement will output `_min_edge` and the length of the `path` list.

Output: **_min_edge, len(path)**
