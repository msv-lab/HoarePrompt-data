Output State: **`que` is a deque with one less element, `node` is the first element that was removed from `que`, `prev` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `node = que.popleft()` removes the leftmost (first) element from the deque `que` and assigns it to the variable `node`. The `prev` dictionary remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it. The `que` deque now has one less element than before.
