Output State: `que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, `curr` is equal to `prev[curr]` until `curr` becomes `-1`, and `path` is a list containing the shortest path from `end` to `start` in reverse order.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `path` will contain the entire shortest path from the `end` node back to the `start` node, listed from the `end` node to the `start` node. The `curr` variable will eventually become `-1` when there are no more predecessors to trace back, indicating that the shortest path has been fully constructed in the `path` list.
