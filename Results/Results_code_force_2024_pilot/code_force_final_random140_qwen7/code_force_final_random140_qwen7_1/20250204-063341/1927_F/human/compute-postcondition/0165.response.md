Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `curr != -1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `curr` is not equal to `-1`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `que` is an empty deque.
   - `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty.
   - `prev` is a dictionary containing the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`.
   - `curr` is updated to the predecessor of `curr` in the shortest path tree.
   - `path` now includes the node `curr`.

3. **Determine What Needs Adjustment**: For the loop to execute one more time, `curr` must not be equal to `-1`. Since `curr` is updated to the predecessor of itself in each iteration, we need to ensure that `curr` still has a valid predecessor (i.e., `curr` is not `-1`).

4. **Adjusting the State**: The only state that directly affects the loop condition is `curr`. We need to ensure that `curr` is not `-1` for the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `curr` to ensure it is not equal to `-1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, `curr` must not be equal to -1, and `path` now includes the node `curr`.**
