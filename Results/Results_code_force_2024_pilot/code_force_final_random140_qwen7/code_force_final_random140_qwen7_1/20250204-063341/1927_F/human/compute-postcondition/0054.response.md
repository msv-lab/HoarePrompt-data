Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, meaning all `m` edges have been processed. At the end of the loop, `w` is the weight of the last edge processed, `u` is one endpoint of that edge, and `v` is the other endpoint. `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, and `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` is the weight of the last edge processed, `start` is `u`, and `end` is `v`. Otherwise, the union operation between `u` and `v` has been performed by `dsu.union(u, v)`, and the DSU structure reflects the union-find relationships among all nodes. The `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weights of the edges, and the `graph` dictionary reflects the final adjacency list structure of the graph after all edges have been added and union operations have been performed.
