Output State: **`i` is 1, `i` must be less than `m`, `u` and `v` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `w` is the same as before, `graph[u]` now includes `v` and `graph[v]` now includes `u`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)`**

Explanation: The code `graph[v].append(u)` appends the value `u` to the list `graph[v]`. Since `u` and `v` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `graph[u]` now includes `v`, after executing the code, `graph[v]` will also include `u`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
