The loop condition is `while que:`. This means the loop continues as long as `que` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `que` is an empty deque.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `que` must be non-empty. Since `que` is currently empty, we need to adjust its state to be non-empty.

State: **`node` will be a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary will be an empty collection. `prev` will contain mappings from each node reachable from `start` to the node that was traversed to reach it. `que` will be a non-empty deque.**
