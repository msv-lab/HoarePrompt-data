Output State: **`node` remains the same, `nei` becomes the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary, `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`, and `que` now contains the new `nei` and `nei` is added to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `que.append(nei)` appends the variable `nei` to the list `que`. This means that `nei` is added to the existing elements in `que`. All other variables (`node`, `nei`, and `prev[nei]`) remain in their previous states as described in the initial state.
