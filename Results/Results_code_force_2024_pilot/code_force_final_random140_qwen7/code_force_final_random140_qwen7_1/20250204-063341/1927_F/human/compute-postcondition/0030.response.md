Output State: **_min_edge is w, parent_u is the root of u in the DSU object dsu, parent_v is the root of v in the DSU object dsu, and all other variables retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The line `_min_edge = w` assigns the value of `w` to `_min_edge`. Since `w` is the weight of the last edge added during the loop's iterations, `_min_edge` now holds this value. The values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` remain unchanged as they are the roots of `u` and `v` respectively in the DSU object `dsu`. All other variables (`end`, `dsu`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `graph`, `edges`, and `start`) retain their previous values as no changes were made to them in the given code snippet.
