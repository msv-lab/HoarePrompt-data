Output State: **`prev` is a dictionary with `{start: -1}`, `que` is a deque containing the element that was previously in the front (now removed) as its first element, `w` is the weight of the last edge processed, `u` is one endpoint of that edge, `v` is the other endpoint of that edge, `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`, the `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weights of the edges, `graph` dictionary reflects the final adjacency list structure of the graph after all edges have been added and union operations have been performed, and we create a deque with the element that was previously in the front (now removed) as its first element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we have exited the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables listed. The `que` and the `graph` remain unchanged, and the other variables retain their previous values.
