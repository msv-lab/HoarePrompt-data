Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `prev` is a dictionary with `{start: -1}`, `que` is a deque containing the element that was previously in the front (now removed) as its first element, `w` is the weight of the last edge processed, `u` is one endpoint of that edge, `v` is the other endpoint of that edge, `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`, the `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weights of the edges, `graph` dictionary reflects the final adjacency list structure of the graph after all edges have been added and union operations have been performed, and we create a deque with the element that was previously in the front (now removed) as its first element, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection. `nei` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `nei` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection. `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `que` contains `nei` added to it. If `node` equals `start` and `nei` equals `end`, we continue the loop or iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `nei` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `nei` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `prev[nei]` is now assigned the value of `node`; `que` contains `nei` and `nei` added to it; `nei` is now the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary. This remains true whether `node` equals `start` and `nei` equals `end`, or not. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `node` remains the same, `nei` becomes the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary, `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`, and `que` now contains the new `nei` and `nei` is added to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
