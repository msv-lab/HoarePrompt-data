Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `w`, `u`, `v`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(w, u, v)` from the `edges` list.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`w`**: This is the weight of the edge being processed.
   - **`u`**: This is one endpoint of the edge.
   - **`v`**: This is the other endpoint of the edge.

4. **Initial States**:
   - `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu`.
   - `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU object `dsu`.

5. **Loop Execution**:
   - If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` is set to `w`, `end` is set to `v`, and `start` is set to `u`.
   - Otherwise, `parent_u` becomes the root of both `u` and `v` after the union operation, and `end` remains `-1`.

6. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, we need to consider the next tuple `(w, u, v)` from the `edges` list.
   - The values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` will change based on the union operation if they were different in the previous iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are the values of `w`, `u`, and `v` from the next tuple in the `edges` list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu`, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU object `dsu`, `w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge**.
