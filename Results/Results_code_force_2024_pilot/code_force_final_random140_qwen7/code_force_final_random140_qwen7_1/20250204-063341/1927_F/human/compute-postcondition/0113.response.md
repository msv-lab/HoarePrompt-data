Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for nei in graph[node]:`. The variables involved in this loop are `nei` and `node`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `que` is a deque with one less element than before.
   - `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`).
   - `nei` is the value of `end` from the previous iteration.
   - `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`, and `prev[nei]` equals `node`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `nei` for each neighbor of `node`, the next iteration will consider the next neighbor of `node`.
   - Therefore, `node` will be updated to the next neighbor in the iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `que` remains a deque with one less element than before because each iteration processes one element.
   - `node` will be the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph.
   - `nei` will be the next neighbor being processed.
   - `prev[nei]` will be updated to the current `node`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `node` is now the next neighbor, and `nei` is the next neighbor being processed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`que` is a deque with one less element than before, `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`), `nei` is the next neighbor being processed, and `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`.**
