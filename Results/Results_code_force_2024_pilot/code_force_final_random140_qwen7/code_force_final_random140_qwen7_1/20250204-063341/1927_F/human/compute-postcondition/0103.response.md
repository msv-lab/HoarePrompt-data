Output State: **`que` is a deque with the element `end` added to it, `node` is the first element that was removed from `que` and has the value `start`, `nei` is the value `end`, and `prev[nei]` is updated to `node`.**

Explanation: The code `que.append(nei)` appends the value of `nei` (which is `end`) to the deque `que`. The other variables (`node` and `prev[nei]`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
