Output State: **`i` is 1, `i` must be less than `m`, `u` and `v` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `w` is the same as before, `graph[u]` now includes `v` and `graph[v]` now includes `u`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)`, `edges` now includes the tuple `(w, u, v)` appended.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains 1 and the condition `i` must be less than `m` is still valid. The values of `u` and `v` remain unchanged as they are the return values from `func_3()`. The lists `graph[u]` and `graph[v]` each include the other value (`v` in `graph[u]` and `u` in `graph[v]`). The list `edges` now includes the tuple `(w, u, v)` appended to its previous content.
