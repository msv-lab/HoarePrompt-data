Postcondition: `node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `nei` is not in `prev`; `que` contains `nei` added to it; if `node` equals `start` and `nei` equals `end`, we continue the loop or iteration; otherwise, no change occurs in `prev` or `que`.
