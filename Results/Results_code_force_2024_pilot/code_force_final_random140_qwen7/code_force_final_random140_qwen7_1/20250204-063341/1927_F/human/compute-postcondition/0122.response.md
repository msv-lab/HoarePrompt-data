The loop condition in the given `while` statement is `que`, which means the loop continues as long as the deque `que` is not empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `que` must contain at least one element.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `que` is an empty deque.
- `node` is the last element that was removed from `que` before `que` became empty.
- `prev` is a dictionary containing the shortest path from `start` to every node in the graph that was reachable within the given constraints.
- The loop would break if the final `node` equals `end`.

Since `que` is currently empty, the loop cannot continue unless `que` contains at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `que` is no longer empty.

State: **`que` is not an empty deque**
