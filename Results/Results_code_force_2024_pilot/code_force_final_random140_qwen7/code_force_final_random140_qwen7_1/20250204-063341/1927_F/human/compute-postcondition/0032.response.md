Output State: **_min_edge is w, parent_u is the root of u in the DSU object dsu, parent_v is the root of v in the DSU object dsu, end is v, start is u**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `v` to the variable `end`. The values of `_min_edge`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`, and `start` remain unchanged from their initial states.
