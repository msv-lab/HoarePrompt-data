Output State: **`que` is a deque with one less element, `node` is the first element that was removed from `que` and has the value `start`, `nei` is the value `end`, `prev` remains unchanged**.

The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the variables `que`, `node`, `nei`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values or affect the deque `que`. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state.
