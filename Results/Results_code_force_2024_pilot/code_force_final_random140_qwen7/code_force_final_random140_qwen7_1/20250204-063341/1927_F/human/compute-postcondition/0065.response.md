Postcondition: `node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, we continue the loop or iteration. If the condition `node == start and nei == end` is not met, the postcondition remains unchanged.
