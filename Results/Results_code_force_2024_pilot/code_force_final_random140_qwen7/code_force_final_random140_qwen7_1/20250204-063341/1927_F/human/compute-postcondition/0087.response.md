Output State: The loop continues to iterate over each neighbor (`nei`) of the current `node` in the `graph` dictionary. For each `nei` that is not already a key in `prev`, the `prev` dictionary is updated such that `prev[nei]` is set to the current `node`. Additionally, `nei` is appended to the `que` deque. This process repeats until there are no more neighbors of the current `node` to process or the `que` is empty.

The final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
- `node` will be the starting node of the traversal, which remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `que` will contain a sequence of nodes representing the path from the start node to the current node, where each node in `que` points to the previous node in the path via the `prev` dictionary.
- `prev` will be a dictionary where each key-value pair represents a node and its parent in the traversal path, starting from the `start` node.

In summary, the `prev` dictionary will map each node visited during the traversal to its parent node, and the `que` deque will contain the nodes in the order they were visited, starting from the `start` node.
