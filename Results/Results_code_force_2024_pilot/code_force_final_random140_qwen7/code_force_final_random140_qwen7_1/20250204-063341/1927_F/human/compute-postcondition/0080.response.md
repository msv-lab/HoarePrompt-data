Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `nei` in `graph[node]`.
   - The relevant variables in the loop head are `node`, `nei`, `prev`, and `que`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and its value is a non-empty collection.
   - `nei` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and its value is a non-empty collection.
   - `prev[nei]` is now assigned the value of `node`.
   - `que` contains `nei` and `nei` was added to it.
   - `nei` is now the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `nei` must be the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary.
   - `prev[nei]` should be updated to the current `node`.
   - `que` should contain the next `nei` and `nei` should be added to it.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `node` remains the same as it is not being modified within the loop.
- `nei` becomes the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary.
- `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`.
- `que` contains the new `nei` and `nei` is added to it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `nei` is the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary; `prev[nei]` is now assigned the value of `node`; `que` contains `nei` and `nei` added to it.**
