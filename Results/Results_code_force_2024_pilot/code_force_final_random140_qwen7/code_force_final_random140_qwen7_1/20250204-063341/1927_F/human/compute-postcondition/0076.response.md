Output State: **`node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `nei` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `nei` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `prev[nei]` is now assigned the value of `node`; `que` contains `nei` added to it; `nei` is now the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary.**

Explanation: The code `prev[nei] = node` updates the `prev` dictionary such that the key `nei` now maps to the value `node`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
