Output State: **`prev` is a dictionary with `{start: -1}`, `que` is a deque containing `start`, `w` is the weight of the last edge processed, `u` is one endpoint of that edge, `v` is the other endpoint, `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`, the `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weights of the edges, the `graph` dictionary reflects the final adjacency list structure of the graph after all edges have been added and union operations have been performed, and we create a deque with `start` as its first element.**

The code initializes the `prev` dictionary with a key-value pair where the start node maps to -1. This does not affect the values of `que`, `w`, `u`, `v`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`, `edges`, or `graph`. The deque `que` remains unchanged, still containing only the `start` node.
