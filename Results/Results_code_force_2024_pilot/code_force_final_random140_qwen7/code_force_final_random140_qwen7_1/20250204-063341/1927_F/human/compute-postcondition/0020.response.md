Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `m-1`; `i` is still less than `m`; `u` holds the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration; `v` holds the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration; `w` holds the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration; the `graph` dictionary has updated its adjacency lists such that for every edge added, both vertices `u` and `v` have each other in their respective adjacency lists; the `edges` list contains tuples `(w, u, v)` for each of the `m` edges added during the loop's iterations; the `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weight `w` of the edges.**

In simpler terms, the `edges` list now contains all the edges added during the loop, sorted in descending order by their weights.
