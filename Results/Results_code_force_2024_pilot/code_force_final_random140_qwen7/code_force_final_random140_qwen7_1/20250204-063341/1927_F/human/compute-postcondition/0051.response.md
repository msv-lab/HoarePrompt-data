Output State: **`w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge, `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`, and the union operation between `u` and `v` has been performed.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v)` operation merges the components containing `u` and `v`. This means that `parent_u` and `parent_v` will now point to the same root node, indicating that `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component. The values of `w`, `u`, `v`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain unchanged except for the fact that their respective components have been united.
