Postcondition: **`parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu` and `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU object `dsu`. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is `w`, `end` is `v`, and `start` is `u`. Otherwise, `parent_u` becomes the root of both `u` and `v` after the union operation, and `end` remains `-1`.**
