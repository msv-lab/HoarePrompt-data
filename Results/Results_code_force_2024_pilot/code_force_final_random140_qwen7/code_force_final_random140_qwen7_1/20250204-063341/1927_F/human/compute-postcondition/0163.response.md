Output State: **`que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, `curr` is updated to the predecessor of `curr` in the shortest path tree, and `path` now includes the node `curr`.**

Explanation: The code `curr = prev[curr]` updates the value of `curr` to the predecessor of the current `curr` in the shortest path tree. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
