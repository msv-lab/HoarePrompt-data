Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 3.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` must be at least 3. This is because the loop continues as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0, and we know it has run through at least 3 iterations, meaning `test_cases` was initially greater than or equal to 3 and has not been reduced below 3 during the loop's execution.
