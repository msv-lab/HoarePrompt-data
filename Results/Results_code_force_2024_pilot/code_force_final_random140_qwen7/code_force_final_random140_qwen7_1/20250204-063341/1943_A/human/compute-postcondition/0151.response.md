Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 2 but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- The current value of `c` is 0 but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `j`.

Output: **1**
