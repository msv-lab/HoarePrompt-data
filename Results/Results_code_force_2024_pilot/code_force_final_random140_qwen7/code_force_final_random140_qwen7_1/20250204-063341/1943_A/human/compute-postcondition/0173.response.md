Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that `cntl[2]` indicates. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify them.
