Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and the iterable `a`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.
   - `i` is the next element in the iterable `a`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be the next element in the iterable `a`.
   - The value of `cntl[i]` does not directly affect the loop continuation; it is just an internal state.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in the iterable `a`, it means the loop can continue as long as there are more elements in `a`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to the next element in `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` is the next element in the iterable `a`.

Since the state of `cntl[i]` does not affect the loop continuation, it remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is the next element in the iterable `a`**
