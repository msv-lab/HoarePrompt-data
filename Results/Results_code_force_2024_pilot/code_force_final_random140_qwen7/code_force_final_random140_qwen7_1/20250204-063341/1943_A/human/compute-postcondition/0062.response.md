Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cntl[i]` for each index `i` in the list will be equal to the frequency of occurrence of `i` in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then `j` is 4, `n` is at least 4, and `cntl[j]` is at least 2 for all `j` from 1 to `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but does not affect the values of `cntl[i]`, `j`, or `n`'s conditions related to `cntl[0]` and `cntl[j]`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `cntl[0]`, `j`, and `n` remain as specified in the initial state.
