Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, the values of `j`, `n`, and `cntl[j]` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the program exits the current loop or if statement.
