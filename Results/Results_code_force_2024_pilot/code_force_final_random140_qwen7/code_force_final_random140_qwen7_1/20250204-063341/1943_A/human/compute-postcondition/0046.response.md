Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `cntl[j]` is at least 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is `cntl[j] - 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `cntl[j]` is at least 2, `c` is `cntl[j] - 1` and the values of `j`, `n`, `cntl[j]`, and `c` remain unchanged.
