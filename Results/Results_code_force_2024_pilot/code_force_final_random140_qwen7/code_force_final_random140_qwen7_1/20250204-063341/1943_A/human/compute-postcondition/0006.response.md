Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the iterable `a`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop condition for the `for i in a` construct is that `i` should be an element of the iterable `a`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in the iterable `a`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is the variable that changes with each iteration, it needs to be updated to the next element in the iterable `a`.
   - The state of `cntl[i]` will be incremented by 1 for the current value of `i`, but since we are moving to the next iteration, we need to consider the new value of `i`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- The variable `i` will be the next element in the iterable `a`.
- The state of `cntl[i]` will be incremented by 1 for the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is the next element in the iterable `a`**
