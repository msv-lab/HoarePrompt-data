Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and either `cntl[j]` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 2 and `c` is `c - 1`. If `c` is 0, the current value of `c` remains `c - 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
