Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is either 1 or 2.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - Either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or if the condition `cntl[j] < 2` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` can be either 1 or 2, the next value of `j` will be 2 if it was 1, and 1 if it was 2. However, since the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is at least 1, both values (1 and 2) are valid for `j`.

5. **Ensure the Loop Condition is Met**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is at least 1, `j` can be 1 or 2.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `j` is set to the next possible value, which is 2 if `j` was 1, and 1 if `j` was 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 2 if it was 1, otherwise 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
