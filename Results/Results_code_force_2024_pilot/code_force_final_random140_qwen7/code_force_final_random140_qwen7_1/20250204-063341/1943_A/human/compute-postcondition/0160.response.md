Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly set to 2.
- `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the `print(j)` statement.
- `cntl[2]` can either be 0 or greater than or equal to 2, but this does not affect the value of `j`.

The `print(j)` statement will simply print the value of `j`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
