Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `n` is stated to be greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[j]` is explicitly stated to be equal to 0.

The print statement `print(j)` will simply print the value of `j`.

Output: **1**
