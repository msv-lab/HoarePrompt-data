Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged as no assignment or modification is performed on these variables within the `break` statement. The condition regarding `cntl[2]` being less than 2 or not does not affect the outcome since the `break` statement itself does not modify any variables.
