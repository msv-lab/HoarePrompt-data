Output State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `a` must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. The precondition that `a` must have at least one element remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, while `a` still must have at least one element.
