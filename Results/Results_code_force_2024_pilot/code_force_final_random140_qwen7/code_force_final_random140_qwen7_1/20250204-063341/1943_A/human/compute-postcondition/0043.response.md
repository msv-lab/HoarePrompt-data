Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `cntl[j]` is at least 1. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is at least 1, `c` is set to `cntl[j] - 1`, and if `c` is not zero, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
