Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least one element.
   - `i` must be an element of `a`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1 (this is not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `a` must have at least one element.
   - `i` is an element of `a`.

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `a` must have at least one element, and `i` must be an element of `a`, for the loop to execute again, `a` must still have at least one element, and `i` must still be an element of `a`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1 (this remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head).
   - `a` must have at least one element.
   - `i` must be an element of `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `a` must have at least one element, and `i` is an element of `a`**
