Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[j]` is now `cntl[j] - 1`, but the exact value of `cntl[j]` after this operation is not needed for the print statement.
- The condition `not c` is true, meaning `c` is false, but this information is not required to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `j`.

Output: **1**
