Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list a containing n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). The function returns different values based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases where each case involves a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. The function processes these inputs according to certain conditions and returns appropriate outputs for each test case.
