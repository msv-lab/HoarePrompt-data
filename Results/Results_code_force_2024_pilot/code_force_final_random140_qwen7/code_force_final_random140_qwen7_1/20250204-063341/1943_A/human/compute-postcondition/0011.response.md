Output State: The value of `cntl[i]` for each index `i` in the list will be equal to the frequency of occurrence of `i` in the list `a`. After all iterations of the loop, `cntl[i]` will contain how many times each integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

This means that if the integer `k` appears `x` times in the list `a`, then `cntl[k]` will be `x` after the loop completes. All other elements in `cntl` that do not correspond to any integer in `a` will still be `0`.
