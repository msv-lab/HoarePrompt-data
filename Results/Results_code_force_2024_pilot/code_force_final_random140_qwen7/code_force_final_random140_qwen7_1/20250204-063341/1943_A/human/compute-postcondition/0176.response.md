Output State: **`j` is 3, `cntl[2]` is 0 or `cntl[2]` is greater than or equal to 2 with `c` being `c - 1`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, since there is no loop or switch statement specified, the `break` statement does not alter the values of any variables. It simply indicates the exit point of a loop or case. Therefore, the values of `j`, `cntl[2]`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
