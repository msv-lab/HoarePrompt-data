Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement. However, the values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial state. The condition regarding `cntl[2]` does not affect the outcome because the `break` statement itself is the only action taken by the code snippet.
