Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and if `cntl[j]` is less than 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is at least 2, then `c` is set to `cntl[j] - 1`. If `c` is not zero, the values of `j`, `n`, `cntl[j]`, and `c` remain unchanged. If `c` is zero, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
