Output State: **j is 3, n is greater than 0, and either `cntl[3]` is 0 indicating the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or `cntl[3]` is greater than or equal to 2 with `c` being `c - 1`. If `c` is not zero, the condition remains unchanged.**

Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop continues to increment `j` until it reaches the maximum value of `n`. After three iterations, `j` will be 3. The conditions for breaking out of the loop depend on the values of `cntl[j]` and `c`. If `cntl[3]` is 0, the loop breaks immediately. Otherwise, `c` decreases by 1 with each iteration, and if `c` becomes 0, the loop also breaks. Since the loop has executed three times, `j` will be 3, and the conditions for `cntl[3]` and `c` will apply as described.
