Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- There is a condition involving `cntl[2]`:
  - If `cntl[2]` is less than 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
  - If `cntl[2]` is not less than 2, the most internal loop or if statement is not broken.

However, the value of `cntl[2]` is not explicitly given, and the code snippet does not include any loops or conditions that would change the value of `j`. Therefore, the value of `j` remains 1.

Output: **1**
