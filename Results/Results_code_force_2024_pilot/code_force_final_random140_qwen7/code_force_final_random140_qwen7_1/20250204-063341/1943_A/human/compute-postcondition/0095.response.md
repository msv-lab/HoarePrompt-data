Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - Either `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `cntl[j]` is not less than 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is not broken.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` (which will be 2) must still be less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it can potentially be greater than or equal to 2 as well.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to 1.
   - The condition involving `cntl[j]` needs to be checked again for `j = 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and either `cntl[2]` is less than 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `cntl[2]` is not less than 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is not broken**.
