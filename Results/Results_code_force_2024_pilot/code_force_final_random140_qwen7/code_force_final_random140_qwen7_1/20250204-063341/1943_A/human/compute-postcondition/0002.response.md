Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 20000, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, splits the input string into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was defined in the initial state, but now there is a new variable `a` which is a list of integers derived from the input.
