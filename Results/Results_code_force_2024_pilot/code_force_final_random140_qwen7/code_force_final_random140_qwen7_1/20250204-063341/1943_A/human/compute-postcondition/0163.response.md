Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is greater than 0 but does not affect the value of `j`.
- `cntl[2]` can either be 0 (indicating the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of) or it can be greater than or equal to 2 (in which case `c` is `c - 1`). However, since `j` is being printed and `j` is not dependent on `cntl[2]` or `c`, the value of `j` remains 2 regardless of the value of `cntl[2]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `j`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
