Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `cntl[j]` is at least 2. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cntl[j]` is at least 2, `c` is `cntl[j] - 1`, and if `c` is not zero, the program continues without changing the values of `j`, `n`, `cntl[j]`, and `c`. If `c` is zero, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
