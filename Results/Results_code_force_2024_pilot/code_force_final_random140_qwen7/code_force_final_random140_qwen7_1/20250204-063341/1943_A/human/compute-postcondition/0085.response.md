Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is now `cntl[j] - 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1 (`c -= 1`). However, since the initial state does not specify what `c` is or its relationship to `cntl[j]`, we can only say that `cntl[j]` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
