Postcondition: `j` is either 2 or 3, and `n` must be at least 3. If the condition `cntl[j] == 0` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `cntl[j] == 0` is false and the condition `not c` is true, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `not c` is false, `j` remains 3 and `n` must still be at least 3.
