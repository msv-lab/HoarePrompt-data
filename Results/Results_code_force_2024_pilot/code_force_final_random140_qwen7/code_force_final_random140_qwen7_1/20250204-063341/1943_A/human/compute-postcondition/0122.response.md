Output State: **All elements in `cntl` are incremented by 3. If `cntl[0]` equals 0, then `cntl[0]` remains 0. Otherwise, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is 0, and `cntl[1]` and `cntl[2]` are both greater than or equal to 2; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. It does not affect the values of `cntl`, `j`, `n` (which is now assigned), `c`, or the conditions related to `cntl[0]`, `cntl[1]`, and `cntl[2]`. Therefore, the values of these variables and conditions remain as described in the initial state, with `n` being updated to the input integer value.
