Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cntl[i]` will be incremented by 1 for each `i` in `a`, and `a` must contain at least three distinct elements. The final values of `cntl` will reflect the count of occurrences of each element in `a`.

This means that if `a` contains elements like `[2, 3, 2, 4, 5]`, then `cntl[2]` will be 2, `cntl[3]` will be 1, `cntl[4]` will be 1, and `cntl[5]` will be 1, assuming these are the only elements in `a`. Elements not present in `a` will remain 0.
