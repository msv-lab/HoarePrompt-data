Output State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `a` must have at least two elements, and `i` is an element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Since `i` is an element of `a` and `a` must have at least two elements, these conditions remain unchanged. Only the value of `cntl[i]` is updated.
