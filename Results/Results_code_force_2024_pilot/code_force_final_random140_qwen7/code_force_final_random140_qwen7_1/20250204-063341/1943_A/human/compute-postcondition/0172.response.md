Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is greater than 0, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[2]` can either be 0 or greater than or equal to 2, but this does not affect the value of `j`.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `j`.

Output: **3**
