You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    if cntl[j] == 0:
                        print(j)
                        break
                    else:
                        c -= 1
                        if not c:
                            print(j)
                            break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. It calculates the frequency of each number in the list \( a \) and determines the smallest index \( j \) (from 1 to \( n \)) that appears fewer than twice in the list. If no such index exists, it prints 0. If the number 0 does not appear in the list, it directly prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the smallest index of 0 if it appears fewer than twice, or the smallest index of any other number that appears fewer than twice.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It populates `cntl` by iterating through `a` and incrementing the count for each element.

3. **Initial MEX Check:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, it prints `0`. This means there are no zeros in the array, and since Alice can always pick a zero, the MEX would be `0`.

4. **Calculating Optimal MEX:**
   - Otherwise, it calculates the initial value of `c` as `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is because Alice can pick up to two zeros.
   - It then iterates through the rest of the elements (from 1 to `n`) and checks the counts:
     - If any element `j` has a count less than 2, it decrements `c` by 1.
     - If `c` becomes zero, it prints `j` and breaks the loop.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Handling Zeros:**
   - The logic correctly identifies if there are no zeros (`cntl[0] == 0`) and outputs `0`, which is correct because Alice can always pick a zero to ensure MEX is `0`.

2. **Handling Other Elements:**
   - The logic of decrementing `c` for elements with count less than 2 is correct. This ensures that the MEX is calculated optimally by considering the maximum number of times Alice can pick a zero and then checking other elements.
   - However, the logic should handle the case where Alice and Bob play optimally more comprehensively. Specifically, it should consider the parity of the number of moves and the distribution of elements.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement using the given program:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 0 0 1 1`
  - `cntl` after processing: `[2, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `c = min(2, 2) = 2`
  - Since `cntl[1]` is `0`, it prints `1`. This is incorrect; the correct MEX should be `2`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4 0 1 2 3`
  - `cntl` after processing: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `c = min(2, 1) = 1`
  - Since `cntl[1]` is `1`, it prints `1`. This is correct; the correct MEX should be `1`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `2 1 1`
  - `cntl` after processing: `[0, 2]`
  - `c = min(2, 0) = 0`
  - Since `cntl[0]` is `0`, it prints `0`. This is correct; the correct MEX should be `0`.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and optimal strategies. Specifically, it does not fully account for the optimal play of both players, especially in scenarios where the distribution of elements affects the MEX calculation.
