Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It populates `cntl` by iterating through `a` and incrementing the count for each element.

3. **Initial MEX Check:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, it prints `0`. This means there are no zeros in the array, and since Alice can always pick a zero, the MEX would be `0`.

4. **Calculating Optimal MEX:**
   - Otherwise, it calculates the initial value of `c` as `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is because Alice can pick up to two zeros.
   - It then iterates through the rest of the elements (from 1 to `n`) and checks the counts:
     - If any element `j` has a count less than 2, it decrements `c` by 1.
     - If `c` becomes zero, it prints `j` and breaks the loop.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Handling Zeros:**
   - The logic correctly identifies if there are no zeros (`cntl[0] == 0`) and outputs `0`, which is correct because Alice can always pick a zero to ensure MEX is `0`.

2. **Handling Other Elements:**
   - The logic of decrementing `c` for elements with count less than 2 is correct. This ensures that the MEX is calculated optimally by considering the maximum number of times Alice can pick a zero and then checking other elements.
   - However, the logic should handle the case where Alice and Bob play optimally more comprehensively. Specifically, it should consider the parity of the number of moves and the distribution of elements.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement using the given program:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 0 0 1 1`
  - `cntl` after processing: `[2, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `c = min(2, 2) = 2`
  - Since `cntl[1]` is `0`, it prints `1`. This is incorrect; the correct MEX should be `2`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4 0 1 2 3`
  - `cntl` after processing: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `c = min(2, 1) = 1`
  - Since `cntl[1]` is `1`, it prints `1`. This is correct; the correct MEX should be `1`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `2 1 1`
  - `cntl` after processing: `[0, 2]`
  - `c = min(2, 0) = 0`
  - Since `cntl[0]` is `0`, it prints `0`. This is correct; the correct MEX should be `0`.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and optimal strategies. Specifically, it does not fully account for the optimal play of both players, especially in scenarios where the distribution of elements affects the MEX calculation.

**Correctness: **False**
