Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `t` must be at least 1, `_rep` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `k` is an integer from the second input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the standard input, splits them by whitespace, converts each to an integer, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `a`, `b`, `t`, and `_rep` remain unchanged from their initial states.
