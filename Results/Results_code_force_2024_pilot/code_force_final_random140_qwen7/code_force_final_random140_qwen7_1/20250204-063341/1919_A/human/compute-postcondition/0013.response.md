Postcondition: `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `k` is an integer from the second input split, and if `n` is less than `k`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
