Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _rep in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n > k:
        print('Bob')
    elif n < k:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `k` is an integer from the second input split. If `n` is greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `t` must be at least 1, `_rep` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `k` is an integer from the second input split. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of the variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` and `k` are integers input from the user split by space and converted to an integer. If `n` is greater than `k`, no change is made to `n` and `k`. Otherwise, no change is made to `n` and `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
