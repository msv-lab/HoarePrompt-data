### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Both players take turns, starting with Alice.
   - In each turn, a player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallets.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - The program then checks if `n > k` and prints "Bob", if `n < k` and prints "Alice", and if `n == k` it also prints "Bob".

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in the program does not fully capture the game mechanics.
   - The program assumes that the player with more coins always wins, which is not true because the player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - The program fails to account for the optimal strategy where players would swap wallets to force the opponent into a losing position.

4. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the test case `1 1`, the program correctly outputs "Bob" because both players have the same number of coins and swapping does not change the outcome.
   - However, for the test case `1 4`, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" instead of "Alice". Alice can swap wallets, leaving Bob with 1 coin, and then Alice can remove her last coin, forcing Bob to lose.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game logic and fails to determine the winner based on the optimal moves. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
