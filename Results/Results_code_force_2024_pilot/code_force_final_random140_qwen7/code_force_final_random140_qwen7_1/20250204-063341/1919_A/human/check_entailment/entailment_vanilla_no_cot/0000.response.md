Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Game Logic Misunderstanding**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the player with more coins always wins. However, the game involves strategic exchanges and reducing the number of coins in each turn. The key insight is that the player who is forced to have 0 coins in their wallet first loses.

2. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach involves checking the parity (odd or even nature) of the initial number of coins in each player's wallet. If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because:
   - Each move reduces the total number of coins by 1.
   - The player who makes the last move (when the total number of coins becomes 1) will force the opponent to lose since the opponent will be left with 0 coins.

### Correct Solution:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This solution checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. If the sum is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
