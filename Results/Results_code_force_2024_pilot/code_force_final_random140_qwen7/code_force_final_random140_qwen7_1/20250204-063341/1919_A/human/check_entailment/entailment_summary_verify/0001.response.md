### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Both players take turns, starting with Alice.
   - In each turn, a player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallets.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - The program then checks if `n > k` and prints "Bob", if `n < k` and prints "Alice", and if `n == k` it also prints "Bob".

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in the program does not fully capture the game mechanics.
   - The program assumes that the player with more coins always wins, which is not true because the player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - The program fails to account for the optimal strategy where players would swap wallets to force the opponent into a losing position.

4. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the test case `1 1`, the program correctly outputs "Bob" because both players have the same number of coins and swapping does not change the outcome.
   - However, for the test case `1 4`, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" instead of "Alice". Alice can swap wallets, leaving Bob with 1 coin, and then Alice can remove her last coin, forcing Bob to lose.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary states that the function reads pairs of integers \(n\) and \(k\), compares them, and prints "Bob" if \(n > k\), "Alice" if \(n < k\), and "Bob" if \(n = k\).
   - This summary is misleading because it does not reflect the actual game mechanics and the optimal strategy.

6. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If \(n > k\), Bob can swap wallets and then Alice will be forced to have fewer coins than Bob after her turn, leading to a situation where Alice eventually runs out of coins first.
   - If \(n < k\), Alice can swap wallets and then Bob will be forced to have fewer coins than Alice after his turn, leading to a similar situation where Bob eventually runs out of coins first.
   - If \(n = k\), the game is symmetric, and the player who starts (Alice) can force a win by always swapping wallets, ensuring that the opponent is left with fewer coins after each turn.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game. It simply compares the initial number of coins without considering the sequence of moves and the ability to swap wallets.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game logic and fails to determine the winner based on the optimal moves. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
