You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _rep in range(t):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n > k:
            print('Bob')
        elif n < k:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _rep in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n > k:
            print('Bob')
        elif n < k:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `t` is an input integer that was initially set but is now exhausted after the loop runs `t` times, `_rep` is equal to `t` (the number of times the loop has executed), `n` and `k` are integers input from the user split by space and converted to an integer. After each iteration, if `n` is greater than `k`, `n` and `k` retain their values; otherwise, they also retain their values. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple pairs of integers \(n\) and \(k\) from the user, compares each pair, and prints 'Bob' if \(n > k\), 'Alice' if \(n < k\), and 'Bob' again if \(n = k\). After processing all pairs, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules. According to the problem description, the game involves taking turns and removing one coin from the player's wallet until someone cannot make a valid move. However, the program simply compares the initial number of coins `n` and `k` and prints the winner based on which is greater. This approach fails to simulate the game's actual mechanics.

For example, consider the case where `a = 2` and `b = 1`. According to the game rules:
- Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
- Alice can choose to either swap wallets or remove a coin from her wallet. If she removes a coin, she will have 1 coin left.
- Bob then has the option to swap or remove a coin. If he removes a coin, he will have 0 coins left and lose the game.

However, the program would incorrectly determine that Alice wins because `2 > 1`, without simulating the actual game turns.

To correctly implement the game, the program needs to simulate the turns and check the state after each move, ensuring that the player who cannot make a valid move loses.
