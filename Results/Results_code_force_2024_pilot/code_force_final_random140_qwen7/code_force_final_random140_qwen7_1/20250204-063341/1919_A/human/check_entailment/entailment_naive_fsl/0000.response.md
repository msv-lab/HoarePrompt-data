Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules. According to the problem description, the game involves taking turns and removing one coin from the player's wallet until someone cannot make a valid move. However, the program simply compares the initial number of coins `n` and `k` and prints the winner based on which is greater. This approach fails to simulate the game's actual mechanics.

For example, consider the case where `a = 2` and `b = 1`. According to the game rules:
- Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
- Alice can choose to either swap wallets or remove a coin from her wallet. If she removes a coin, she will have 1 coin left.
- Bob then has the option to swap or remove a coin. If he removes a coin, he will have 0 coins left and lose the game.

However, the program would incorrectly determine that Alice wins because `2 > 1`, without simulating the actual game turns.

To correctly implement the game, the program needs to simulate the turns and check the state after each move, ensuring that the player who cannot make a valid move loses.
