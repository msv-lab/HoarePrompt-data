Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution in `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem constraints and logic. Specifically, it does not account for the dynamic pricing increase after purchasing tickets on a particular day. Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: Sorting the prices does not help in solving the problem because the prices can change dynamically based on the number of tickets purchased on any given day.

2. **Dynamic Pricing Increase**: The solution does not implement the logic where the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets purchased on a given day. This means that the prices are not updated correctly after each purchase.

3. **Buying Tickets**: The function buys tickets in a greedy manner without considering the dynamic pricing changes. It simply buys the maximum number of tickets possible each day without adjusting the prices.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a dynamic programming approach or a priority queue to keep track of the minimum cost to buy tickets while respecting the dynamic pricing rules. Hereâ€™s a high-level outline of how to approach the problem correctly:

1. Use a data structure (like a priority queue) to keep track of the days and their prices.
2. Maintain a running total of tickets bought and update the prices dynamically based on the tickets bought on each day.
3. Continue buying tickets until the required number is met, ensuring the prices are adjusted correctly after each purchase.

Given the complexity, the provided solution does not meet these requirements and thus is incorrect.
