Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function aims to calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets given the constraints. It sorts the prices in ascending order and iteratively buys tickets starting from the cheapest day, ensuring not to exceed `m` tickets per day. This approach ensures that the tickets are bought at the lowest possible cost while respecting the constraints. The logic seems sound for minimizing the cost.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases. It correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters, and prints the results. The logic for reading input and calling `func_1` appears to be correct.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, both functions together seem to correctly implement the solution to the problem. `func_1` calculates the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets, and `func_2` processes the test cases and outputs the results correctly.

Correctness: **True**
