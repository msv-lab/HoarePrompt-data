Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets purchased on a day affects the prices of subsequent days. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not adjust the prices after purchasing tickets on a given day. This means that the function does not account for the increase in ticket prices for subsequent days as per the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`
- `prices = [1, 3, 8, 4]`

The correct approach would be:
1. On day 1, buy 2 tickets at a cost of 2 (total cost = 2). Prices for the next days become [5, 8, 4].
2. On day 2, buy 1 ticket at a cost of 5 (total cost = 7). Prices for the next day become [13, 4].
3. On day 3, buy 1 ticket at a cost of 13 (total cost = 20).

However, the current implementation buys tickets without adjusting the prices for subsequent days. It simply sorts the prices and buys tickets based on the sorted order, which does not reflect the actual logic required by the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
