### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Prices**: The function starts by sorting the `prices` list. This is unnecessary because the problem does not specify that the prices must be sorted before purchasing tickets. Sorting the prices can lead to suboptimal solutions since it doesn't account for the dynamic pricing adjustment.

2. **Loop Through Days**: The function iterates through each day and determines how many tickets to buy based on the remaining tickets to be bought (`k - tickets_bought`) and the maximum tickets allowed per day (`m`). It then calculates the cost for those tickets and adds it to the total cost.

3. **No Price Adjustment**: Importantly, the function does not adjust the prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets bought on the current day. According to the problem statement, the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets bought on the current day for all subsequent days. This is a critical omission in the current implementation.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the example provided in the problem description:
- `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`
- `prices = [1, 3, 8, 4]`

The correct approach should be:
1. **Day 1**: Buy 2 tickets at a cost of 2 (total cost = 2). Prices for the next days become `[5, 8, 4]`.
2. **Day 2**: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 5 (total cost = 7). Prices for the next day become `[13, 4]`.
3. **Day 3**: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 13 (total cost = 20).

However, the current implementation:
1. Sorts the prices to `[1, 3, 4, 8]`.
2. Buys 2 tickets at a cost of 1 (total cost = 1). Prices for the next days become `[3, 4, 8]`.
3. Buys 1 ticket at a cost of 3 (total cost = 4). Prices for the next day become `[6, 8]`.
4. Buys 1 ticket at a cost of 6 (total cost = 10).

This shows that the current implementation does not correctly handle the price adjustments, leading to a higher cost compared to the optimal solution.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- This function handles reading input and calling `func_1` for each test case. It correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets purchased on a day affects the prices of subsequent days. The function `func_1` does not adjust the prices after purchasing tickets, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
