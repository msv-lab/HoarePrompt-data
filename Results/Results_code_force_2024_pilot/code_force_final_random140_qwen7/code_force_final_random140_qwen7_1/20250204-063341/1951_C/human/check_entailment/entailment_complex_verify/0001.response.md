### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the core logic of the program is sound and will produce the correct results. However, the assessment also notes that the sorting of the `prices` list is unnecessary and inefficient. Let's re-evaluate the program with a focus on the essential correctness and efficiency:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to minimize the cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days, with the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought each day.
   - The algorithm iterates through each day, determining how many tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`), calculating the cost, updating the total cost, and reducing the remaining tickets to buy.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly handles the adjustment of future prices based on the number of tickets bought on each day.
   - The sorting of the `prices` list is unnecessary because the algorithm can work directly with the unsorted list of prices. Sorting does not affect the correctness of the algorithm but introduces an unnecessary computational overhead.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of prices for each day.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.
   - The overall structure of `func_2` is correct and efficient.

Given that the core logic of the program is correct and the sorting step is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness, we can conclude that the program will produce the correct results. The original assessment accurately identifies the redundancy in sorting but does not impact the overall correctness.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct despite the unnecessary sorting step, as the core logic remains sound and produces the correct results.
