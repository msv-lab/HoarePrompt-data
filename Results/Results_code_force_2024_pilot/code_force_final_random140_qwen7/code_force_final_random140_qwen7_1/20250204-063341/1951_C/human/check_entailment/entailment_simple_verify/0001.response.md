### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the core logic of the program is sound and will produce the correct results. The only issue mentioned is the unnecessary sorting of the `prices` list, which is indeed redundant and inefficient. However, the assessment does not overlook the fact that the algorithm correctly handles the logic of buying tickets and adjusting future prices based on the number of tickets bought on each day.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the algorithm, the sorting step does not impact the correctness of the solution. The algorithm ensures that the minimum cost is achieved by always buying the cheapest available tickets first, which is the optimal strategy under the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct despite the unnecessary sorting step, as the core logic remains sound and produces the correct results.
