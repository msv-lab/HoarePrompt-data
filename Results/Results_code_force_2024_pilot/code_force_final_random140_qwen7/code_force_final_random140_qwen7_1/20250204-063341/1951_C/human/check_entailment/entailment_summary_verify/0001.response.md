### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the core logic of the program is sound and will produce the correct results. The only identified issue is the unnecessary sorting of the `prices` list, which does not affect the correctness but introduces an unnecessary computational overhead.

However, let's re-evaluate the program to ensure there are no other potential issues and confirm the final assessment.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Core Logic**: The function iterates through each day, determining how many tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`), calculating the cost, updating the total cost, and reducing the remaining tickets to buy. This logic is correct and ensures that the minimum cost is achieved by always buying the cheapest available tickets first.
   - **Unnecessary Sorting**: While the sorting step is unnecessary, it does not affect the correctness of the program. The algorithm works correctly even without sorting the `prices` list.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices, and calls `func_1` with these parameters.
   - **Output Handling**: The function prints the result returned by `func_1` for each test case.

Given that the core logic of the program is correct and the sorting step, although unnecessary, does not impact the correctness, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The given program is correct despite the unnecessary sorting of the `prices` list. The core logic ensures that the minimum cost is achieved by always buying the cheapest available tickets first, and the input/output handling is also correct.
