Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9), and prices is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

The given code is a docstring comment and does not affect any of the variables or their values. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
