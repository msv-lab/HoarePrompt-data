Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `prices` is a list of integers from the input split.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` remain as integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1. Therefore, `t` must be 1 for the loop to execute again.

5. **State the updated state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `t`, and it must be 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`prices` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain as integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`, `t` is 1**
