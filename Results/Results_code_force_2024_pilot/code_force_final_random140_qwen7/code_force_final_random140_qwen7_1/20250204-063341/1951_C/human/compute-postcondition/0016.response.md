Based on the initial state provided:

- `prices` is a list of integers from the input split.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.
- `t` is 1.

The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`, which is the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the output of the function call with the given parameters.

Output: **result (the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices))**
