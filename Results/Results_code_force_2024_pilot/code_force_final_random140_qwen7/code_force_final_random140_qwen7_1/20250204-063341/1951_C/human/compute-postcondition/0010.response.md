Output State: **`prices` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain as integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` has been called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`, and its return value has been assigned to `result`. The other variables retain their initial states as described.
