Output State: **`prices` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`, `t` is 1**

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)` calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. The return value of `func_1` is assigned to the variable `result`. The values of `prices`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
