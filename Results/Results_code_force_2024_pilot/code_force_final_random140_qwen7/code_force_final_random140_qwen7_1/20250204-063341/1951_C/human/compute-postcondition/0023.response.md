Output State: **`tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, `total_cost` is updated to `2 * total_cost + cost`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[i]`, `total_cost` is updated by adding `cost` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code `tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy` increases the value of `tickets_bought` by the value of `tickets_to_buy`. The other variables (`total_cost`, `i`, `n`, and `cost`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their conditions and values remain the same as per the initial state.
