Output State: **`result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers; `prices` is a list of integers created by converting the input split into integers; `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `prices` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. These integers are then assigned to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `prices` is a list of integers created by splitting the input and converting each part to an integer. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0. The value of `result` remains the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.
