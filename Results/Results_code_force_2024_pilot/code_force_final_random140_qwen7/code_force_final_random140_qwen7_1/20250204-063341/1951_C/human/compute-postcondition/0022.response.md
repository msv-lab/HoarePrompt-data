Output State: **`tickets_bought` is increased by `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `total_cost` is updated to `2 * total_cost + cost`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[i]`, `total_cost` is updated by adding `cost` to its current value.**

In more natural language: `tickets_bought` is increased by the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. `total_cost` is doubled and then `cost` is added to it. `i` is incremented by 1. `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`. `cost` is calculated as `tickets_to_buy * prices[i]`, and `total_cost` is updated by adding this `cost` to its current value.
