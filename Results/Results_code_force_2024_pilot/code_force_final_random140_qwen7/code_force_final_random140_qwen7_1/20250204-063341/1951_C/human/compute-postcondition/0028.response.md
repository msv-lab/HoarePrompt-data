Output State: All tickets have been bought (`tickets_bought` equals `k`), the total cost is the sum of the costs calculated for each day until `k` tickets were purchased, `n` is the number of sale days, `m` is the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is the total number of tickets to buy, `i` is the last index of the `prices` list that was used (i.e., `n-1`), and `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order. The loop has completed all its iterations, and `tickets_bought` equals `k`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, all `k` tickets have been bought, the total amount spent (`total_cost`) is the sum of the cost of each batch of tickets bought on each day, and the loop has exited because `tickets_bought` equals `k`.
