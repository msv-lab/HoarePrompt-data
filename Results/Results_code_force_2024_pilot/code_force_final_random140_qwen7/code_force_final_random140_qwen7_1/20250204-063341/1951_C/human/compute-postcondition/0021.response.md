Output State: **`tickets_bought` is increased by `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `total_cost` is updated to `2 * total_cost + cost`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[i]`**.

This means that the value of `tickets_bought` is increased by the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. The `total_cost` is updated to twice its original value plus the `cost`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. The `cost` is calculated as `tickets_to_buy` multiplied by `prices[i]`.
