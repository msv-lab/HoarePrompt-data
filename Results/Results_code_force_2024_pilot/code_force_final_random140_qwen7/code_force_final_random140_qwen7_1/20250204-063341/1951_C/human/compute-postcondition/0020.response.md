Output State: **`tickets_bought` is increased by `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `total_cost` is updated to `total_cost + total_cost + cost`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.

This means that:
- `tickets_bought` is increased by the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.
- `total_cost` is updated to `total_cost + total_cost + cost`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid.
