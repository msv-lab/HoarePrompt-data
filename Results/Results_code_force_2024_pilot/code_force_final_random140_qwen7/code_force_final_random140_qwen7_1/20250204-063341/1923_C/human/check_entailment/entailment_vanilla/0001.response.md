Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the array `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes two arrays `ones` and `sum` to store the cumulative counts and sums, respectively.
   - This initialization helps in calculating the number of 1s and the sum within any range efficiently using prefix sums.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - `ones[i]` stores the count of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`.
   - `sum[i]` stores the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum (`sumInRange`) within the specified range `[l, r]`.
   - The condition for a subarray to be "good" is checked using the formula:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \le \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - Simplifying the condition:
     \[
     \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \le \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - If the condition holds, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition \( \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \le \text{sumInRange} \) is correct for determining if a subarray can be transformed into another array `b` satisfying the given conditions.
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray can be split into two parts: the sum of the 1s and the sum of the non-1s, with the non-1s being strictly greater than 0.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `l == r` by printing "NO", which is correct since a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the conditions.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of prefix sums allows efficient computation of the required values for each query, making the solution scalable for large inputs.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
