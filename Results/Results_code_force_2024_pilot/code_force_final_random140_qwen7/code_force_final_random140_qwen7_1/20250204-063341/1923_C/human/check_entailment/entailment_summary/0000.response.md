Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two arrays `ones` and `sum` to keep track of the cumulative counts of 1s and the cumulative sums, respectively.
   - It iterates through the array to fill these cumulative arrays.
   - For each query, it calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum of elements (`sumInRange`) within the specified range `[l, r]`.
   - It checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) holds. This condition is used to determine if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` satisfying the given conditions.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) simplifies to \(\text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange}\).
   - This condition ensures that the number of 1s plus the remaining non-1 elements in the subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the subarray. This is a necessary condition for the subarray to be "good" because it implies that the subarray can be split into parts where the transformation is possible.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(l = r\) by printing 'NO', which is correct since a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the condition \(a_i \neq b_i\).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
