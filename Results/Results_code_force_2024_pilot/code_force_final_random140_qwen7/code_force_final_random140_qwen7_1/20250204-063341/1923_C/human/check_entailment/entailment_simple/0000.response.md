Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions. A subarray is good if there exists another array \(b\) of the same length such that:
   - The sums of the subarray and \(b\) are equal.
   - All elements in the subarray and \(b\) are different.
   - All elements in \(b\) are positive.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases, each with an array \(c\) and multiple queries on subarrays of \(c\).
   - It uses prefix sums and counts of 1s to efficiently check the conditions for each query.
   - The logic checks if the subarray can be transformed into another array \(b\) satisfying the conditions by comparing the sum and count of 1s within the subarray.

3. **Key Points in the Code**:
   - **Prefix Sums and Count of 1s**: The code calculates the prefix sums (`sum`) and counts of 1s (`ones`) up to each index in the array.
   - **Query Processing**: For each query, it calculates the sum and count of 1s in the specified subarray using the prefix sums and counts.
   - **Condition Check**: It checks if the subarray can be transformed into another array \(b\) by verifying the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is derived from the requirement that the sum of the subarray must be achievable by changing some elements to values greater than 1 while keeping the sum constant.
   - This condition ensures that there are enough non-1 elements to replace some 1s with larger values without exceeding the sum of the subarray.

Given the logical correctness of the approach and the proper implementation of the conditions, the provided solution appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
