You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

            continue
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `n`; `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`; `ones[n]` is the count of `1`s in `nums`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The `sum[n]` will be the cumulative sum of all elements in the `nums` list. Similarly, `ones[n]` will represent the total count of `1`s present in the `nums` list.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `0`, `l` and `r` are the last pair of integers entered by the user during the last iteration of the loop, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, and `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`. If the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it checks whether a specific condition is met based on the count of 1s and the sum of elements within a specified range of the list. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results of each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the given problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that satisfies the conditions, but it does not properly handle the requirement that `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i`. The program incorrectly counts the number of 1s in the subarray and uses this to determine if the subarray is good, which does not fully capture the required conditions.

For example, consider the subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` from the provided example. The subarray from index 1 to 3 is `[2, 1, 4]`. The program would incorrectly determine this subarray as good because it counts the number of 1s and checks the sum condition, but it does not ensure that each element can be mapped to a different value while maintaining the sum and positivity conditions.

To fix this, the program needs to check if it's possible to transform the subarray into another array `b` where each element is different and positive, and the sum remains the same. This requires a more complex algorithm that ensures each element can be uniquely mapped to a different value while maintaining the sum and positivity constraints.
