Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly parses the input and initializes necessary variables.
2. It calculates the prefix sums and counts of 1s for the array `nums`.
3. For each query, it checks if the subarray from `l` to `r` is good based on the given conditions.
4. The logic for checking if the subarray is good is correct. Specifically, it checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds true, which simplifies to checking if the sum of the subarray can be split into two different arrays satisfying the conditions.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program appears to be correct. The program handles the input and output as specified and performs the required checks accurately.

Correctness: **True**
