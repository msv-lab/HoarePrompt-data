Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it checks whether a specific condition is met based on the count of 1s and the sum of elements within a specified range of the list. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results of each query.**
