Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop in question is defined as:
   ```python
   for _ in range(q):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   The loop variable here is `_`, but it is not used in the loop body. Instead, the loop is iterating `q` times.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`
   - `i` is `q`
   - `l` is an input integer
   - `r` is an input integer
   - `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition does not depend on any specific variable within the loop itself, but rather on the value of `q`. The loop will continue to execute until `q` reaches 0.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` (which is `q`) is decreased by 1.

5. **New State**: After decrementing `q` by 1, the new state should reflect this change. The other variables (`l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, and `sumInRange`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop iteration count.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q - 1`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`**
