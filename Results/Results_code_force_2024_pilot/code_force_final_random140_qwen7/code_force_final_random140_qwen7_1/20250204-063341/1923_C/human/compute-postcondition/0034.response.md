Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q - 1`, `l` and `r` are updated to integers entered by the user, and `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`**.

The code simply reassigns the value of `onesInRange` to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`. This does not change the values of `i`, `l`, `r`, or `sumInRange`. The values of `l` and `r` are updated to the integers entered by the user, and `i` remains as `q - 1`. The precondition that `l` equals `r` would not make any change to these variables, but since the code does not check for this condition, it is assumed that `l` and `r` are updated regardless.
