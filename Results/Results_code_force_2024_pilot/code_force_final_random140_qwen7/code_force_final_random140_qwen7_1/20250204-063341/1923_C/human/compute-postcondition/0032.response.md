The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q - 1`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.**
