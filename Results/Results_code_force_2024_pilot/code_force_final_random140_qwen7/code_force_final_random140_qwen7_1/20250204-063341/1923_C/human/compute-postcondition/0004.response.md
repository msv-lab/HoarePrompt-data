Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized to 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[1, n + 1)`. This means `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - **Variable `i`**: It should start at 1.
   - **Variable `n`**: It should be a valid integer such that the loop can execute.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` starting at 1 and `n` being a valid integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be a valid integer**
