Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(q):`. This means the loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) is being assigned values from `range(q)`.
   - The only variable involved in the loop head is `q`, which determines how many times the loop will iterate.

2. **Determine the Final State After the Loop:**
   - After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `_` will be equal to `q` because `range(q)` generates numbers from `0` to `q-1`, and the last value generated is `q-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be equal to `q` after the loop completes.
   - The cumulative sum of all elements in `nums` will be stored in `sum[n]`.
   - The count of `1`s in `nums` will be stored in `ones[n]`.

3. **Adjust the Initial States:**
   - Since `i` will be equal to `q` after the loop, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `q` at the start of the loop.
   - The values of `sum[n]` and `ones[n]` will be updated during the loop, but their initial states do not affect the loop execution directly. They will be modified within the loop body.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be set to `q` at the start of the loop.
- No adjustments are needed for `sum[n]` and `ones[n]` since they will be updated within the loop body.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `q`**.
