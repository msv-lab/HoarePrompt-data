Output State: **`i` is 3, `sum[3]` is `sum[2]` + `nums[2]`, `ones[3]` is `ones[2]` + (1 if `nums[2]` == 1 else 0)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum[3]` to be `sum[2] + nums[2]`. It does not affect the value of `i` or the expression for `ones[3]`. The initial conditions for `ones[3]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
