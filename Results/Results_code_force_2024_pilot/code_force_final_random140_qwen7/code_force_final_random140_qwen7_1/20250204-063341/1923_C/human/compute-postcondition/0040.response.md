Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q - 2`, `l` and `r` are integers entered by the user, and `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))` takes two integers as input from the user and assigns them to `l` and `r`. The values of `onesInRange`, `i`, and `sumInRange` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `l` and `r` as integers entered by the user, while keeping the other variables in their original expressions.
