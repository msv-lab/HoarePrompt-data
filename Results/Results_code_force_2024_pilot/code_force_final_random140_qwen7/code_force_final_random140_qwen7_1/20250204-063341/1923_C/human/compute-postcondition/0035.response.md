Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q - 1`, `l` and `r` are updated to integers entered by the user, and `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The line `sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]` does not change any variables other than `sumInRange`. It simply reassigns the value of `sumInRange` to the same expression it was initially defined as. Therefore, the values of `onesInRange`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `sumInRange` remain unchanged from their initial states.
