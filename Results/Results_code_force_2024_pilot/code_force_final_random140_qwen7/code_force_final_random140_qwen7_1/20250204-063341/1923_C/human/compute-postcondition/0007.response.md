Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `sum[1]` is `sum[0]` + `nums[0]`
   - `ones[1]` is `ones[0]` + (1 if `nums[0]` == 1 else 0)

Given the loop condition `i in range(1, n + 1)`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `sum[2]` will be calculated based on the previous values.
   - `ones[2]` will be calculated based on the previous values.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `sum[2]` is `sum[1]` + `nums[1]`, `ones[2]` is `ones[1]` + (1 if `nums[1]` == 1 else 0)**
