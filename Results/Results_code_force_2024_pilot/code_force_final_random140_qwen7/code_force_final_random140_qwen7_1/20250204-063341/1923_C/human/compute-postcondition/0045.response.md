Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q - 2`, `l` and `r` are integers entered by the user, and `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]` does not change the value of `sumInRange`. It simply reassigns the same value to `sumInRange`. Therefore, the values of `onesInRange`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `sumInRange` remain unchanged from their initial states.
