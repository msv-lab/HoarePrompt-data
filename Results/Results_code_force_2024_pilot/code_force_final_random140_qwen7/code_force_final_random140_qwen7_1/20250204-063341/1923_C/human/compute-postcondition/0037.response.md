Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`
- `i` is set to `q - 1`
- `l` and `r` are updated to integers entered by the user
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
