Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `i` is set to `q`.
- `l` is an input integer.
- `r` is an input integer.
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- The expression `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange)` is evaluated.

The `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Given this information, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
