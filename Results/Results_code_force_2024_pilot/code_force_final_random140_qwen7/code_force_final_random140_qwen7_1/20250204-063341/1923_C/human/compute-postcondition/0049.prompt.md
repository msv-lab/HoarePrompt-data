Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n`; `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`; `ones[n]` is the count of `1`s in `nums`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The `sum[n]` will be the cumulative sum of all elements in the `nums` list. Similarly, `ones[n]` will represent the total count of `1`s present in the `nums` list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If the condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange)` is satisfied, then no changes are made. Otherwise, the condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange)` is true, and no changes are made either.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q - 1`, `l` and `r` are updated to integers entered by the user, and `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q - 2`, `l` and `r` are integers entered by the user, and `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
