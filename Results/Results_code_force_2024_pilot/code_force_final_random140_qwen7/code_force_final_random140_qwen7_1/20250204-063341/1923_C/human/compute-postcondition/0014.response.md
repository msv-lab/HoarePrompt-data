Output State: `i` is `n`; `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`; `ones[n]` is the count of `1`s in `nums`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The `sum[n]` will be the cumulative sum of all elements in the `nums` list. Similarly, `ones[n]` will represent the total count of `1`s present in the `nums` list.
