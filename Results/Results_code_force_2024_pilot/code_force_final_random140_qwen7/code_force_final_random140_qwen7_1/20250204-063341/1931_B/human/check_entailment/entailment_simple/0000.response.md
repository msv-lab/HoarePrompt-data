Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the given array of water amounts in the containers can be made uniform through the specified operations. However, the logic in the program is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array `arr` in ascending order. This step is unnecessary for determining if the water amounts can be made uniform.
2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order (`all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1))`). This condition is not relevant to the problem. The problem requires making all water amounts equal, not just ensuring they are in non-decreasing order.
3. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve the problem, one should check if the average water amount per container is an integer. If the sum of all water amounts is divisible by the number of containers `n`, then it is always possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
