Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func_1()` checks if the list of water amounts in each container (`arr`) is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this is not the correct approach to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the allowed operations.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if the average amount of water per container is an integer. If the sum of the water amounts is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), then it is possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers. This is because each container can only transfer water to a container with a higher index, but the total amount of water must remain constant and evenly distributable.

The current implementation simply checks if the list is sorted, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
