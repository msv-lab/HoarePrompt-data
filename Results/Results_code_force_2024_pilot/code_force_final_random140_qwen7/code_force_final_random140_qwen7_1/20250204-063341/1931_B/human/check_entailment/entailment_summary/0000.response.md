Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the `func_1` function checks if the list of water amounts is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not a necessary condition for making all containers have the same amount of water. Instead, the correct approach is to check if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among the containers, which means the average amount of water per container should be an integer.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:
- The program checks if the list is sorted, which is not relevant to the problem.
- The program does not calculate the average amount of water per container and check if it can be evenly distributed.

To fix this, the program should calculate the total amount of water and check if it is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If it is, then it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

Correctness: **False**

A corrected version of the program would look like this:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_water = sum(arr)
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This version correctly checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, which is the key condition for the problem.
