### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index (i) must be less than the destination container index (j).

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (n), the only way to achieve equal distribution is if the initial distribution of water can already be evenly divided among the containers. This means each container should start with the same amount of water, which is the total water divided by n.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - The provided solution sorts the array `arr` and checks if it is a non-decreasing sequence.
   - If the array is sorted and non-decreasing, it implies that the water can be evenly distributed because the smallest amount of water in any container is at least as much as the smallest amount in the next container, and so on.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The sorting approach works under the assumption that the initial distribution can be made uniform through the allowed operations.
   - However, the key point is that the sum being divisible by n ensures that an equal distribution is theoretically possible, but the sorting check alone does not guarantee that the exact equal distribution can be achieved through the specified operations.

5. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The provided solution correctly identifies if the initial distribution can be made uniform by checking if the array is sorted.
   - However, the problem statement specifies that we can pour water from any container to any other container where the source index is less than the destination index. This means we can always redistribute the water to achieve an equal distribution if the total sum is divisible by n.
   - The sorting check is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving the desired state. While a sorted array indicates a potential path to equal distribution, it does not guarantee that the exact equal distribution can be achieved through the specified operations.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that the program reads the number of test cases (`t`), processes each test case by reading `n` and the array `arr`, sorts `arr`, and then checks if the array is non-decreasing.
   - The sorting step is unnecessary for determining the possibility of equal distribution because the sum being divisible by `n` is the key condition. Sorting only helps in identifying a potential path but does not ensure the exact equal distribution.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution incorrectly assumes that the array being sorted is a sufficient condition for achieving the desired state. While the sum being divisible by `n` guarantees the possibility of equal distribution, the sorting check is not required and does not guarantee the exact equal distribution through the specified operations.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because the sorting check is unnecessary and does not guarantee the exact equal distribution through the specified operations.
