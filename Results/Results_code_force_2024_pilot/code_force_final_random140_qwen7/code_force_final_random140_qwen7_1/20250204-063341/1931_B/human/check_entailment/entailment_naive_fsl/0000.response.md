Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order and prints 'YES' if it is, otherwise 'NO'. However, the problem requires making the amount of water in all containers the same, not just checking if the array is sorted.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
The program will output 'YES' because the array is not sorted, but according to the problem description, it is not possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, so the correct output should be 'NO'.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if the average amount of water per container can be achieved by pouring water between containers. Since the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, the average amount of water per container is `sum(a_i) / n`. The program should verify if it's possible to distribute the water such that each container has this average amount.
