Postcondition: `current_balance` is increased by the value of `a[i] - target`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the conditions remain as per the precondition.
