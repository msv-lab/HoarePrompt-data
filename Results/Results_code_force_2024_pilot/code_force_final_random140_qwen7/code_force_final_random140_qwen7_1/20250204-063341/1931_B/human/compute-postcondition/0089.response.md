Output State: **`current_balance` is `current_balance + a[i] - target + a[i] - target`, `i` is `i + 2 + 2`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The line `possible = False` sets the variable `possible` to `False`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `current_balance`, `i`, `total_water`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
