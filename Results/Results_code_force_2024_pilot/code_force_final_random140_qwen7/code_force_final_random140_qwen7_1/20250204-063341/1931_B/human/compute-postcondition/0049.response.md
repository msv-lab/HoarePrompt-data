Output State: **`current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The current balance is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` and then subtracting `target`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The variables `n` and `possible` remain unchanged unless `current_balance` becomes less than 0, in which case `possible` would be set to `False`. Since no such condition is met in the given code snippet, `n` and `possible` retain their previous states.
