Output State: **`current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[2] - target + ... + a[n-1] - target`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `possible` remains `False`, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `total_water` is updated to be the sum of all elements in `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `total_water` to be the sum of all elements in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
