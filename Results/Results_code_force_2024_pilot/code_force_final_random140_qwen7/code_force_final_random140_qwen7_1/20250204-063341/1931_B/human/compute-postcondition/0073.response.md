Output State: **`current_balance` is 0, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `True`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `target` is `total_water // n`.**

Explanation: The line `possible = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `possible`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `current_balance`, `total_water`, `t`, `n`, and `target` remain unchanged from their initial states.
