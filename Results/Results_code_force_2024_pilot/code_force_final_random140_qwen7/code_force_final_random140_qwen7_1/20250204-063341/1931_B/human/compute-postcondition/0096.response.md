Based on the initial state provided:

- `current_balance` is calculated as `current_balance + sum(a) - n * target`
- `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`
- `possible` is `False`
- `t` remains unchanged
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `target` is `total_water // n`
- The final value of `current_balance` is less than 0, causing the loop to break
- The if condition `(possible)` evaluates to `False`

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Even though the values of other variables like `current_balance`, `total_water`, `possible`, etc., are described, they do not affect the execution of this specific print statement. The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
