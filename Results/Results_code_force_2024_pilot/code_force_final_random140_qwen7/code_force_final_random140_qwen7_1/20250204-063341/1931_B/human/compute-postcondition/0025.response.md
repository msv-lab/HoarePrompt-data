Output State: `t` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If `arr` is a sorted list, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since no modifications are made in the else part.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations (which is equal to its initial value), but it cannot go below 2. Each iteration processes an input `n` and sorts the array `arr`. The final value of `t` will be the initial value minus the number of iterations completed, and `arr` will be sorted as per the input for each iteration.
