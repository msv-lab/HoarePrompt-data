Output State: **`current_balance` is `current_balance + a[i] - target + a[i] - target`, `i` is `i + 2 + 2`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `current_balance`, `i`, `total_water`, `possible`, or `t`. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
