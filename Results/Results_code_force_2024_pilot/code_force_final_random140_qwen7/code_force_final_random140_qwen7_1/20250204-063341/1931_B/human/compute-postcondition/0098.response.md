Based on the initial state provided:

- `current_balance` is calculated as `current_balance + sum(a) - n * target`
- `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`
- `possible` is `False`
- `t` remains unchanged
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `target` is `total_water // n`
- The final value of `current_balance` is greater than or equal to 0

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
