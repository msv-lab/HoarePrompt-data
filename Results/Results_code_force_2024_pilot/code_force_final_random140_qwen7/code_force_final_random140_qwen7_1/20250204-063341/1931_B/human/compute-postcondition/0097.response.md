Postcondition: **`current_balance` is `current_balance + sum(a) - n * target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `target` is `total_water // n`, and the final value of `current_balance` is greater than or equal to 0**
