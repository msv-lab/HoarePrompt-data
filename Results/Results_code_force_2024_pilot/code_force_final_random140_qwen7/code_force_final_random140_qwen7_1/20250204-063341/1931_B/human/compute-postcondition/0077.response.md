Output State: **`current_balance` is `current_balance + a[i] - target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `target` is `total_water // n`, and the current value of `current_balance` is less than 0.**

Explanation: The line `possible = False` sets the variable `possible` to `False`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `current_balance`, `total_water`, `t`, `n`, and `target` remain unchanged from their initial states.
