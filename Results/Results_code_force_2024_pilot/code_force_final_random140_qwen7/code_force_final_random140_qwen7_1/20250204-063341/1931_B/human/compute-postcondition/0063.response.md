Postcondition: **`current_balance` will be the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`. `possible` will be `False` if `current_balance` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise it will remain `True`. Since the program does not enter the if block, `possible` remains `False` if `current_balance` was less than 0 at any point, and it becomes `True` otherwise.**
