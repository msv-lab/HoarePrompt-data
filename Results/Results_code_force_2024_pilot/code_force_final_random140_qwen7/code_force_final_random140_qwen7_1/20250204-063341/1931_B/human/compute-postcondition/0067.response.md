Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop variable `_` is being incremented from 0 to `t-1`. However, since the variable `_` is typically an underscore (which is used as a throwaway variable), it does not carry any meaningful state that needs adjustment.

2. **Identify Relevant Variables**: The relevant variables that might change within the loop and affect the loop continuation are `current_balance`, `n`, `target`, and `possible`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `current_balance` is non-negative. If `current_balance` becomes negative at any point, `possible` will be set to `False`.

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value does not matter.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.
   - `current_balance` could change based on the loop body, but we need to ensure it doesn't go below zero.
   - `n` and `target` might change based on the loop body, but their values at the start of the next iteration depend on how they are updated inside the loop.
   - `possible` will be `False` if `current_balance` goes below zero at any point; otherwise, it remains `True`.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, we need to ensure that `current_balance` does not go below zero and that `possible` is correctly updated.

**Step-by-Step Adjustment**:
- If `current_balance` is still non-negative, `possible` remains `True`.
- If `current_balance` goes below zero at any point, `possible` becomes `False`.

Since the exact values of `current_balance`, `n`, and `target` are not specified, we assume they are updated within the loop body. Therefore, the key state to adjust is `possible`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`current_balance` will be the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, `possible` will be `True` if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop. Otherwise, `possible` will be `False`, and `t` remains unchanged.**

In summary, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`current_balance` will be the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, `possible` will be `True` if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop. Otherwise, `possible` will be `False`, and `t` remains unchanged.**
