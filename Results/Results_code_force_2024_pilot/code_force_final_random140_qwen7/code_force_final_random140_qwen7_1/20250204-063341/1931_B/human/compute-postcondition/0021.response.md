Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\). This information about `t` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the `print` statement.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, but again, its contents are not required to determine the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES', regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`.

Therefore, the output will be **YES**.
