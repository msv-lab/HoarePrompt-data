You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and there are n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        arr.sort()
        
        if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If `arr` is a sorted list, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since no modifications are made in the else part.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations (which is equal to its initial value), but it cannot go below 2. Each iteration processes an input `n` and sorts the array `arr`. The final value of `t` will be the initial value minus the number of iterations completed, and `arr` will be sorted as per the input for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. The function checks if the sum of the integers `a_i` is divisible by `n` and returns `True` if the condition is met for all test cases, otherwise it returns `False`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
