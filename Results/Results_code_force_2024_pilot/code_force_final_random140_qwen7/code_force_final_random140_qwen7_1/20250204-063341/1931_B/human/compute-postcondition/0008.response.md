Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces. However, it is explicitly stated that the list `arr` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`, and only outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **'NO'**
