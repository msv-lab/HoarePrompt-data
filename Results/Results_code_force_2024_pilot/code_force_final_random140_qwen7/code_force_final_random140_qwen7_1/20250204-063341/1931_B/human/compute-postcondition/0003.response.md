Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in the list `arr`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
