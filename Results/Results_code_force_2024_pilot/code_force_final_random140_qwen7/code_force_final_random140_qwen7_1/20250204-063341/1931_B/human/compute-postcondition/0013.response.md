Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `arr` is modified to be sorted, but its elements are now in a sorted order.
