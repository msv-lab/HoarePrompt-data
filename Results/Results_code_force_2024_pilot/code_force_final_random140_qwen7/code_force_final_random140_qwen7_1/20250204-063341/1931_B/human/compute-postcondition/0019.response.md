Output State: **`t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
