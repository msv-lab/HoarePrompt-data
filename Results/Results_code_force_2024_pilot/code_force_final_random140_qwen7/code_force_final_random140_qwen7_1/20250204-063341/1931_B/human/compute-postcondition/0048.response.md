Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The relevant variables here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop updates `current_balance` to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`. If `current_balance` becomes less than 0, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop exits.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`.
   - If `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop exits.
   - Otherwise, no specific changes are made beyond the initial update to `current_balance`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `current_balance` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `possible` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (unless it was set to `False` due to `current_balance` being less than 0).

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before, `possible` remains the same unless it was set to `False` due to `current_balance` being less than 0.**
