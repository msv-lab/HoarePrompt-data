Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `current_balance` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `possible` is `True`, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    current_balance += a[i] - target
    if current_balance < 0:
        possible = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no specific changes are made beyond the initial update to `current_balance`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `possible` is set to `False`. This happens if and only if `current_balance` is less than 0. If `current_balance` is not less than 0, no changes are made to `current_balance`, `i`, or `possible`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `current_balance` is increased by the value of `a[i] - target`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no specific changes are made beyond the initial conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
