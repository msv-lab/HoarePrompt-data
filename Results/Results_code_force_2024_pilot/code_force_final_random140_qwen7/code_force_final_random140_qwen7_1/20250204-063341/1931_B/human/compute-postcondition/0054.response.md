Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition states that if `current_balance` is less than 0, then `current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `possible` is set to `False`. If `current_balance` is not less than 0, no changes are made to `current_balance`, `i`, or `possible`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i` and `n`, we need to check if `i < n` for the next iteration.
   - From the postcondition, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.
   - `current_balance` and `possible` are not guaranteed to change unless `current_balance` was less than 0 in the previous iteration. However, since we are asked to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we assume the worst-case scenario where `current_balance` could be less than 0.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target` (if `current_balance` was less than 0), `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `possible` is set to `False` (if `current_balance` was less than 0)**.

However, since we need to provide a simplified answer focusing only on the loop head variables and their adjustments:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
