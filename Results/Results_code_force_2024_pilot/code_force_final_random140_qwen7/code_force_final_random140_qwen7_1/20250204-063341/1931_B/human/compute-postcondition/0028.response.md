Output State: `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[2] - target + ... + a[n-1] - target`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of list `a`, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of elements in list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `possible` remains `False`, `i` is `n`, and if `current_balance < 0` at any point, we break out of the loop.

In natural language, this means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `current_balance` will be the sum of each element in list `a` minus `target`, for every index from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `t` remains greater than 0, `n` must be at least as large as the length of list `a`, `a` remains a list of integers, `total_water` is still the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `possible` remains `False`, and `i` will be `n` (one past the last index processed). If at any point during the loop, `current_balance` becomes negative, the loop breaks early and does not process the remaining elements.
