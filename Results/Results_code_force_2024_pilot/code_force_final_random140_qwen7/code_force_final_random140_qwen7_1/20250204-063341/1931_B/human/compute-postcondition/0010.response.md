The only objects in the loop head are variables `t` and `_`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is now decreased by 1 but still greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**
