Based on the initial state provided:

- `current_balance` is calculated as `a[0] - target + a[2] - target + ... + a[n-1] - target`, where `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` is at least the length of list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
- `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`.
- `possible` remains `False`.
- `i` is `n`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will directly print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
