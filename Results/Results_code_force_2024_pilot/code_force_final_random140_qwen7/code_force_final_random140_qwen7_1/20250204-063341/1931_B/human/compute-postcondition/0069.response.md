Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `current_balance` will be the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, `possible` will be `True` if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop. Otherwise, `possible` will be `False`, and `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts them into a list of integers. This list replaces the previous value of `a`. The initial conditions regarding `current_balance`, `possible`, and `t` remain unchanged and are still valid. `n` is an input integer, which also remains unchanged.
