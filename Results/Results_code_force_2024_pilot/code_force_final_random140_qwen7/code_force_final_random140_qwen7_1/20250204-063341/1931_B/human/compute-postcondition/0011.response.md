Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t` and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` still must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, and `arr` remains a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
