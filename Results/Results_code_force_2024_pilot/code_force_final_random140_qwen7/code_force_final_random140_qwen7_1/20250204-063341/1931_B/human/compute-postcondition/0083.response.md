Output State: **`current_balance` is `current_balance + a[i] - target`, `i` is `i + 1`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged, `target` is `total_water // n`**

Explanation: The line `possible = False` sets the variable `possible` to `False`. None of the other variables (`current_balance`, `i`, `total_water`, `t`, or `target`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
