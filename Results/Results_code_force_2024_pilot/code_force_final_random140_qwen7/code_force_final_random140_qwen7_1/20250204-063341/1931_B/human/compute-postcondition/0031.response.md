Postcondition: **`current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[2] - target + ... + a[n-1] - target`, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` is at least the length of list `a`, `a` remains a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `possible` remains `False`, `i` is `n`, and `current_balance` does not become negative during the loop execution.**
