Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If all elements of `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the list `arr` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.**
