State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The upper limit of `t` is given as \(10^4\) (10,000).
4. Therefore, `t` must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Since the only variable involved in the loop head is `t`, and it must satisfy the condition for the loop to execute, the state adjustment is straightforward.
