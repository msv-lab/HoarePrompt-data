Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `current_balance` is `current_balance + a[i] - target`
   - `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`
   - `possible` is `False`
   - `t` remains unchanged
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `target` is `total_water // n`
   - The current value of `current_balance` is less than 0
   - The loop breaks out if `current_balance` is less than 0 or if it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - The loop will break if `current_balance` becomes less than 0 during the iteration.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `i` from 0 to `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the problem statement specifies that `n` must be greater than 0 and does not indicate any change in `n` within the loop.
   - `current_balance` will be updated based on the new value of `a[i]` (the element at the current index `i`).
   - `total_water` remains unchanged as it is the sum of all elements in `a` and does not depend on the loop index `i`.
   - `possible` remains `False` as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `target` remains the same as it is calculated once at the beginning and does not change within the loop.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `current_balance` will be updated to `current_balance + a[i+1] - target` (since `i` will be incremented by 1).
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `total_water` remains the same.
   - `possible` remains `False`.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `target` remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`current_balance` is `current_balance + a[i+1] - target`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged, `target` is `total_water // n`**.
