Output State: **After all iterations, `current_balance` will be the sum of all elements in `a` for all test cases minus `n` times `target` for each test case. `possible` will be `True` for each test case if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop, otherwise, it will be `False`. `t` will be 0 since all test cases have been processed. `n` will be the length of `a` for each test case, and `total_water` will be the sum of all elements in `a` for each test case. `target` will be `total_water // n` for each test case.**

This means that after processing all `t` test cases, the loop will have iterated through all provided inputs, and for each test case, it will have determined whether it's possible to distribute water such that no bucket has a negative balance. The final state of `current_balance` and `possible` will reflect the outcome of this check for each test case, and `t` will be depleted to 0 as all cases have been handled.
