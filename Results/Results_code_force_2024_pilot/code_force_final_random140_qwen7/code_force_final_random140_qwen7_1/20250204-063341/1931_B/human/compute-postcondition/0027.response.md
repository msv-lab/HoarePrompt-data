Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then sorts the list `a` and checks if the list is already sorted. If the list is sorted, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the sorting condition.**
