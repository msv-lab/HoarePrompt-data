Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 sorted integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged, but the list `l` is now sorted.
