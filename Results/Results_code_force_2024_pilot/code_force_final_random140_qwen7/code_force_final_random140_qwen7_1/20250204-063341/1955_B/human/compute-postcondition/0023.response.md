Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `k`.
   - The loop range is defined by `r`.

2. **Understand the Initial Conditions:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1.
   - `r` is `n^2 // 2`.
   - The postcondition is that if `l[1]` is not equal to `l[-2]`, the function returns 'no'. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the initial precondition.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `r`.
   - Since `k` is currently 1, the loop will execute again if `k < r`.
   - Therefore, `k` will be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `r` remains unchanged as it is determined by the value of `n` and does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `k` will be updated to 2.
   - `r` remains `n^2 // 2`.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The new state should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`k` is 2, `r` is `n^2 // 2`**
