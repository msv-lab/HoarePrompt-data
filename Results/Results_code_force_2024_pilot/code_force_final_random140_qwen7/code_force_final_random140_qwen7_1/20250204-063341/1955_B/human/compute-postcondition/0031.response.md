Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \), where \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 500, and \( c \) and \( d \) are integers between 1 and \( 10^6 \). It also accepts a list \( l \) containing \( n^2 \) integers, each between 1 and \( 10^9 \). The function first sorts the list \( l \) and checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in \( l \) equals \((n - 1) \times (c + d)\). If not, it returns 'no'. If the condition is met, it further checks if the middle element of the list equals half the sum of the first and last elements when \( n \) is odd. If this condition is also met, it then verifies if the list is symmetric around its center. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no' multiple times based on the failure of any of the above conditions.**
