Output State: **The program returns 'no'**

Given the initial state where `k` is 2 and `r` is `n^2 // 2`, the provided code snippet simply returns the string `'no'`. There is no calculation involving `r` or any other variable, and the return statement does not reference `k` or `r`. Therefore, the program returns the string `'no'`.
