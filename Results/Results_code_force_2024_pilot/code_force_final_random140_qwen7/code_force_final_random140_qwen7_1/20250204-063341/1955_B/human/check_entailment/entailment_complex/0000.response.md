Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the given list of integers can form a progressive square based on the provided \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).

1. **Sorting and Initial Check**: The program first sorts the list \( l \) and checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in \( l \) equals \((n - 1) \times (c + d)\). This is a necessary condition for the list to potentially form a progressive square.

2. **Middle Element Check**: If the initial check passes, the program checks if the middle element of the sorted list equals half the sum of the first and last elements when \( n \) is odd. This ensures that the middle element is correctly positioned as per the properties of a progressive square.

3. **Symmetry Check**: Finally, the program checks if the list is symmetric around its center. This is crucial because in a progressive square, the elements should mirror each other around the center.

If all these conditions are met, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the list can form a progressive square. If any condition fails, the function returns 'NO'.

Given the detailed state transitions and the logical steps taken by the function, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
