### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires constructing a progressive square matrix based on the given `a_{1,1}`, `c`, and `d`.
   - A progressive square matrix is defined such that each element \(a_{i,j}\) can be calculated using the formula \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array `l`.
   - It checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `l` equals \((n - 1) * (c + d)\).
   - It checks if the middle element (if `n` is odd) is half the sum of the smallest and largest elements.
   - It checks if the elements are symmetric around the middle.

3. **Conditions Analysis**:
   - The first condition checks if the range of values in `l` matches the expected range for a progressive square. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition.
   - The second condition checks if the middle element is consistent with the expected value for a progressive square. This is another necessary but not sufficient condition.
   - The symmetry check is not directly related to the construction of a progressive square.

4. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - The conditions in `func_1` are not sufficient to ensure that the array `l` can form a progressive square. The conditions only check some properties of the array but do not validate the entire structure of the progressive square.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the example where `n = 3`, `c = 2`, `d = 3`, and `l = [3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 10, 4, 8]`.
     - The difference between the maximum and minimum values is \(10 - 3 = 7\), which matches \((3 - 1) * (2 + 3) = 10 - 3 = 7\).
     - The middle element (since `n` is odd) is `7`, and \(\frac{3 + 10}{2} = 6.5\), which does not match `7`.
     - Despite failing the middle element check, the array should still be considered a progressive square because the elements can be rearranged to fit the pattern.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The conditions in `func_1` are not sufficient to correctly identify whether the array can form a progressive square. The original assessment is accurate in pointing out that the provided code does not fully validate the structure of the progressive square.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not fully validate the structure of the progressive square.
