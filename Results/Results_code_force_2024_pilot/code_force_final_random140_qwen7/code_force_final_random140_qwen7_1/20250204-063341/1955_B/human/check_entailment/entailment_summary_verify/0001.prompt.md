You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    l.sort()
    if not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d):
        return 'no'
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if n % 2 != 0:
        if not l[r] == a // 2:
            return 'NO'
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
    return 'yes'



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts three parameters \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \), where \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 500, and \( c \) and \( d \) are integers between 1 and \( 10^6 \). It also accepts a list \( l \) containing \( n^2 \) integers, each between 1 and \( 10^9 \). The function first sorts the list \( l \) and checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in \( l \) equals \((n - 1) \times (c + d)\). If not, it returns 'no'. If the condition is met, it further checks if the middle element of the list equals half the sum of the first and last elements when \( n \) is odd. If this condition is also met, it then verifies if the list is symmetric around its center. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no' multiple times based on the failure of any of the above conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a progressive square matrix based on the given `a_{1,1}`, `c`, and `d`. However, the provided code does not implement this logic.
2. Instead, the code attempts to verify if the given array `l` could be part of such a progressive square by checking certain conditions.
3. Let's analyze the conditions used in `func_1`:
   - It sorts the array `l`.
   - It checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values is `(n - 1) * (c + d)`.
   - It checks if the middle element (if `n` is odd) is half the sum of the smallest and largest elements.
   - It checks if the elements are symmetric around the middle.
4. These conditions do not guarantee that the array can form a progressive square. A progressive square has a specific pattern where each element can be calculated using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`. The provided checks do not validate this pattern.
5. Given the problem constraints and the need to construct the matrix, the current approach is insufficient and incorrect.
