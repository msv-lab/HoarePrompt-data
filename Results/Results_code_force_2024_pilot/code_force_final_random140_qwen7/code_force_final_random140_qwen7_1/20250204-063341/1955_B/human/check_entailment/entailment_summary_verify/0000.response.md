### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` first sorts the list `l`.
   - It checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `l` equals \((n - 1) \times (c + d)\).
   - If this condition is met, it further checks if the middle element of the list equals half the sum of the first and last elements when `n` is odd.
   - Finally, it verifies if the list is symmetric around its center.

2. **Problem Description and Expected Behavior:**
   - A progressive square is constructed such that each element \(a_{i,j}\) is calculated using the formula \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\).
   - The program should verify if the given array can be rearranged to form a progressive square.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program sorts the list `l`, which is a necessary step to ensure the elements are in a specific order.
   - The condition \((l[-1] - l[0]) == (n - 1) \times (c + d)\) ensures that the range of values in the array matches the expected range for a progressive square.
   - The check for the middle element (when `n` is odd) ensures that the central element is consistent with the expected value.
   - The symmetry check ensures that the array is structured correctly around the center.

4. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
     - \(n = 3\)
     - \(c = 2\)
     - \(d = 3\)
     - Array: \([3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 11, 4, 8]\)

   - Sorting the array gives \([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 11]\).
   - The difference between the maximum and minimum elements is \(11 - 3 = 8\), which matches \((3-1) \times (2 + 3) = 10\). This condition is not met, so the program should return "NO".
   - The middle element (when `n` is odd) is checked, but since the difference condition fails, the program should not proceed to the next checks.
   - The symmetry check is not performed because the difference condition fails.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly identifies that the given array cannot form a progressive square by failing the initial range check.
   - The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it only checks the difference between the maximum and minimum elements without verifying the actual values. However, the program does perform additional checks (middle element and symmetry) after passing the initial range check.

Given the analysis, the program does correctly implement the logic for checking if the given array can form a progressive square. The original assessment was overly critical and did not fully account for the additional checks performed by the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
