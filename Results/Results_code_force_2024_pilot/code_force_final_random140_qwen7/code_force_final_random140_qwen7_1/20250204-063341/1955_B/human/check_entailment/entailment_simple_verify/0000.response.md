### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Check for Progressive Square:**
   - The program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted array equals \((n-1) \cdot (c + d)\). This is insufficient to verify if the array forms a progressive square.
   - The program does not validate that each element in the array matches the formula \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\).

2. **Symmetry Check:**
   - The program checks if the array is symmetric around the center. While this is a necessary condition for a progressive square, it is not sufficient. The symmetry alone does not guarantee that the values follow the correct arithmetic progression.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
     - \(n = 3\)
     - \(c = 2\)
     - \(d = 3\)
     - Array: \([3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 11, 4, 8]\)
   - Sorting the array gives \([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 11]\).
   - The difference between the maximum and minimum elements is \(11 - 3 = 8\), which matches \((3-1) \cdot (2 + 3) = 10\).
   - However, the array does not contain the correct sequence to form a progressive square. The correct sequence would be \([1, 3, 5; 4, 6, 8; 7, 9, 11]\).

4. **Additional Issues:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is not symmetric around the center correctly.
   - The program does not check the values of the elements to ensure they follow the progressive square formula.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program does not correctly implement the logic for checking if the given array can form a progressive square.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly validate the elements of the array to ensure they form a progressive square according to the specified rules.
