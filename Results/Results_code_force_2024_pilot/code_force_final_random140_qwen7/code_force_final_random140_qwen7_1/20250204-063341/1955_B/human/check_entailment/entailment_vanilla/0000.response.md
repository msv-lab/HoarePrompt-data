Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a progressive square matrix based on the given `a_{1,1}`, `c`, and `d`. However, the provided code does not implement this logic.
2. Instead, the code attempts to verify if the given array `l` could be part of such a progressive square by checking certain conditions.
3. Let's analyze the conditions used in `func_1`:
   - It sorts the array `l`.
   - It checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values is `(n - 1) * (c + d)`.
   - It checks if the middle element (if `n` is odd) is half the sum of the smallest and largest elements.
   - It checks if the elements are symmetric around the middle.
4. These conditions do not guarantee that the array can form a progressive square. A progressive square has a specific pattern where each element can be calculated using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`. The provided checks do not validate this pattern.
5. Given the problem constraints and the need to construct the matrix, the current approach is insufficient and incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
