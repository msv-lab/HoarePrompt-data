### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the conditions it uses to determine if the array `l` can form a progressive square.

1. **Sorting the Array**: The code sorts the array `l`. Sorting alone does not ensure that the array can form a progressive square. Progressive squares have a specific arithmetic progression pattern, which sorting does not preserve.

2. **Difference Check**: The condition `if (not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d)) :` checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a progressive square. While it ensures that the range of values is correct, it does not check the specific arithmetic progression required.

3. **Middle Element Check**: The condition `if (not l[r] == a // 2) :` checks if the middle element (if `n` is odd) is half the sum of the smallest and largest elements. This is another necessary but not sufficient condition. It ensures that the middle element fits the arithmetic progression but does not validate the entire structure.

4. **Symmetry Check**: The loop `for k in range(r):` checks if the elements are symmetric around the middle. This is a necessary condition but again does not fully validate the progressive square pattern.

5. **Pattern Validation**: To correctly validate a progressive square, we would need to check if each element in the array can be generated using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`. The provided code does not perform this validation.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation is indeed insufficient and incorrect. The conditions checked are necessary but not sufficient to validate a progressive square. The original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to validate a progressive square.
