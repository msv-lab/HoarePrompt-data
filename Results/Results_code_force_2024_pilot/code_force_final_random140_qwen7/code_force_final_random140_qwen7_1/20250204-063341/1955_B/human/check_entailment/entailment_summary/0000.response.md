Reasoning:  
The provided program logic has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list `l` is unnecessary and may affect the original order of the elements, which is important for checking symmetry.
2. **Middle Element Check**: The check for the middle element only works correctly when `n` is odd. However, the program does not handle even `n` cases properly.
3. **Symmetry Check**: The symmetry check is implemented incorrectly. It should compare pairs of elements from the start and end of the list, but the current implementation does not handle the center element correctly for both even and odd `n`.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the list can form a progressive square.

Correctness: **False**
