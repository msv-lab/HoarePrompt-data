You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        m = string[0]
        k = 0
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        
        m = string[0]
        
        k = 0
        
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))
        
    #State: Output State: All test cases specified by `cnt_test_cases` have been processed, and for each input string, the program has determined whether it should print 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string or 'No'. The variable `total` remains unchanged from its initial value, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, and `t` remains unchanged. For each input string, `i` is equal to the length of the string, `m` is the first character of the string, and `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string. If `k` is equal to the length of the string, the program prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the program has processed all test cases, printed 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string for those strings that do not consist entirely of the same character, and printed 'No' for those that do. The initial conditions and other variables outside the loop remain as they were initially.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not generate a new string `r` that is different from the input string `s`. Instead, it checks if all characters in the string are the same and prints "No" if they are, which is not in line with the problem description. Additionally, it sorts the string and prints it, which does not guarantee that the new string `r` is different from `s`.

For example, consider the input "aaaaa":
- The program will output "No" because all characters are the same.
- However, according to the problem description, since all characters are the same, it should be impossible to rearrange the string to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`, so the correct output should be "NO".

Another example is "co":
- The program will output "Yes" and sort the string to get "co".
- According to the problem description, this is a valid rearrangement, but since the original string is already a valid rearrangement of itself, the output should still be "NO".

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
