Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly handles the case where the string consists of a single unique character (e.g., "a", "c", etc.). In such cases, it correctly outputs "No" because no rearrangement of the string will result in a different string.
2. For strings with more than one unique character, the program sorts the string and outputs "Yes" followed by the sorted string. This approach ensures that the output string is different from the input string, as sorting will change the order of characters unless the string already consists of a single character.
3. The program processes each test case independently and does not rely on the state of previous test cases, which is appropriate for this problem.
4. The program handles the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and the length of each string is at most 10) effectively.

Given these points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
