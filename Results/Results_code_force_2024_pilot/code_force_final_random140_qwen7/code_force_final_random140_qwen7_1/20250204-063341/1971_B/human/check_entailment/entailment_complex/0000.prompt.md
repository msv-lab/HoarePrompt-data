Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        
        m = string[0]
        
        k = 0
        
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))
        
    #State: Output State: All test cases specified by `cnt_test_cases` have been processed, and for each input string, the program has determined whether it should print 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string or 'No'. The variable `total` remains unchanged from its initial value, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, and `t` remains unchanged. For each input string, `i` is equal to the length of the string, `m` is the first character of the string, and `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string. If `k` is equal to the length of the string, the program prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the program has processed all test cases, printed 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string for those strings that do not consist entirely of the same character, and printed 'No' for those that do. The initial conditions and other variables outside the loop remain as they were initially.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. It checks each string to determine if it consists entirely of the same character. If so, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results without modifying any external variables.
