You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        m = string[0]
        k = 0
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. It checks each string to determine if it consists entirely of the same character. If so, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results without modifying any external variables.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cnt_test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string`.

2. **Single Character String Check:**
   - If the length of the string is 1, the program prints 'No'. This is correct because there are no other characters to rearrange into a different string.

3. **Character Frequency Check:**
   - The program initializes `m` with the first character of the string.
   - It counts how many times this character appears (`k`).
   - If `k` equals the length of the string, it means all characters in the string are the same, so the program prints 'No'. This is also correct because there are no other characters to rearrange into a different string.

4. **Generating Rearranged String:**
   - If the above conditions are not met, the program prints 'Yes' and then sorts the string and prints it.
   - Sorting the string will give a different arrangement of the characters unless all characters are identical, which has already been checked.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case: "codeforces"**
  - Length is 10, not 1.
  - All characters are different.
  - Output: `Yes` followed by a sorted version of the string, e.g., `codeforces` → `ccdefoorrst`.

- **Test Case: "aaaaa"**
  - Length is 5, not 1.
  - All characters are the same.
  - Output: `No`.

- **Test Case: "co"**
  - Length is 2, not 1.
  - Characters are different.
  - Output: `Yes` followed by a sorted version of the string, e.g., `co` → `co`.

- **Test Case: "d"**
  - Length is 1.
  - Output: `No`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the cases where the string length is 1 and where all characters are the same. For other cases, it generates a rearranged string by sorting the input string, which is a valid rearrangement unless the string consists of identical characters.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program meets the requirements.
