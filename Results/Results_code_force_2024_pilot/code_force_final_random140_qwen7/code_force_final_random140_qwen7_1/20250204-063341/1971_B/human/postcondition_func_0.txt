The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. It checks each string to determine if it consists entirely of the same character. If so, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results without modifying any external variables.
