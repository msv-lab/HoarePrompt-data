Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 2, and the current value of `string[i]` is the second character of `string`**.

Explanation: The code `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. Initially, `k` was equal to 1, so after executing this line, `k` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
