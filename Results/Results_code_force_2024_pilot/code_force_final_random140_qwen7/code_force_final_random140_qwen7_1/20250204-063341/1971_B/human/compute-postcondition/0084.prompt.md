Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt_test_cases` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
    string = input().strip()
    if len(string) == 1:
        print('No')
    m = string[0]
    k = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == m:
            k += 1
    if k == len(string):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')
        print(''.join(sorted(string)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is equal to the length of `string`, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`. If `k` is equal to the length of `string`, then `k` equals the length of `string`; otherwise, `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the if-else block executes, `i` will be equal to the length of `string`, `k` will be the total count of the first character `m` in the string `string`, and all other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`) will remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is less than `len(string)`, `i` is equal to `len(string) - 1`, `k` is either the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string` or one less than that (depending on whether `string[len(string) - 1] == m`), `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is equal to `len(string)` if and only if the condition `k == len(string)` is true in the if part. Otherwise, `k` is either the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string` or one less than that (depending on whether `string[len(string) - 1] == m`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
