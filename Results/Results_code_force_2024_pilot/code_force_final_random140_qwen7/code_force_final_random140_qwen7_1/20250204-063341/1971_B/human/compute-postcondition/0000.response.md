Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.** 

Explanation: The code `cnt_test_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cnt_test_cases`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 is still valid.
