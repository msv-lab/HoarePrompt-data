Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(string)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < len(string)`.

3. **Analyze the given postconditions**:
   - `i` is less than `len(string)`
   - `i` equals the previous value of `i` plus 2 (if certain conditions are met)
   - `k` is either 1 or 2 (if certain conditions are met)
   - `total` remains unchanged
   - `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged
   - `t` remains unchanged
   - `m` is the first character of `string`

4. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < len(string)`, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(string)` for the next iteration.
   - `i` will be incremented by 2 if `string[i] == m` is true, otherwise it will increment by 1.
   - `k` will be set to either 1 or 2 if `string[i] == m` is true, otherwise it will remain 0 or 1.
   - All other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, `m`) remain unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 or 2 depending on the condition.
   - `k` will be set to 1 or 2 if the condition is true, otherwise it will remain 0 or 1.
   - `m` remains the first character of `string`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 or 2.
- `k` will be 1 or 2 if the condition is true, otherwise it will remain 0 or 1.
- `m` remains the first character of `string`.
- All other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `i + 1` or `i + 2`, `k` is either 1 or 2, `m` is the first character of `string`, `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged**
