Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is equal to the length of `string`, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the string. The variable `k` will hold the total count of occurrences of the first character `m` in the string `string`. All other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, and `t`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
