Output State: **`k` is 1, `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is the first character of `string`, and the current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. The other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, `m`, and the current value of `string[i]`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
