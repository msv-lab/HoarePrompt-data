Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be less than `len(string)`, `i` will be equal to `len(string) - 1`, `k` will be either the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string` or one less than that (depending on whether `string[len(string) - 1] == m`), `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is the first character of `string`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` will have reached the end of the string (or just before it, if the last character is not `m`). The variable `k` will hold the count of how many times the character `m` appears in the string `string`. All other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, and `m`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
