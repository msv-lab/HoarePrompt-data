Output: **No**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `k` is equal to `len(string)`, meaning `k` is the length of the string.
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Since no variables or objects within the print statement change their values, and the print statement itself does not depend on any other variables, it directly prints the string `'No'`.
