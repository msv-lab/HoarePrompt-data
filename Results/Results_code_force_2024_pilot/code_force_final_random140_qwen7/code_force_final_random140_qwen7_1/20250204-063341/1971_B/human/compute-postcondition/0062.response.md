Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(len(string)):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `len(string)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - According to the given state before the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `string` + 1.
   - For the loop `for i in range(len(string))` to execute, `i` must be less than `len(string)`.
   - Since `i` is initially set to `length_of_string + 1`, it is not less than `len(string)`, so the loop will not execute as written.

3. **Adjust the State of `i`:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be less than `len(string)`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be `len(string)` or less.

4. **Determine the State of `len(string)`:**
   - The length of `string` is a constant value derived from the string itself.
   - This value does not change within the loop, but it is necessary to know its value to determine if the loop should execute.

5. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - `k`, `total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, and `m` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute based on the given information.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i` to be less than `len(string)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` must be less than `len(string)`, `k` is 0, `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is the first character of `string`**
