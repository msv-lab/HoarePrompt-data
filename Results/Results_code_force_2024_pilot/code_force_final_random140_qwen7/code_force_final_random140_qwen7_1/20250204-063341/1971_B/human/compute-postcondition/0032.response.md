Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is equal to the length of `string` + 1, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`, and `string` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
