Postcondition: `i` is an index within the string, `k` is 1, `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is the first character of `string`, and if `string[i]` is equal to `m`, then the condition is met as specified. If `string[i]` is not equal to `m`, the condition does not change.
