Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and the length of the `string` is equal to 1.

The `print('No')` statement will simply print the string "No" to the console.

Output: **No**
