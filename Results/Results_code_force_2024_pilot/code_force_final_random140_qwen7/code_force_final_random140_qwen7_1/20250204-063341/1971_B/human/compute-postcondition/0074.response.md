Output State: **`i` is less than `len(string)` and equals the previous value of `i` plus 4, `k` is either 2 or 3, `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is the first character of `string`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 1 or 2 to either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The condition that `i` is less than `len(string)` and equals the previous value of `i` plus 3 is updated to `i` being less than `len(string)` and now equals the previous value of `i` plus 4.
