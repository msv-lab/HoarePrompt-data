Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is equal to the length of `string`.
- `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `m` is the first character of `string`.
- `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`.
- `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.

The `print('Yes')` statement simply outputs the string "Yes" without referencing any of the variables or their values.

Output: **Yes**
