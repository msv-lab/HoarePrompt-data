Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is equal to `len(string)`, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string because the loop increments `i` for each iteration until it reaches the length of the string. The value of `k` will be the total count of occurrences of the first character `m` in the string `string`, as the loop increments `k` each time it finds `m` in the string. All other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, and `t`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
