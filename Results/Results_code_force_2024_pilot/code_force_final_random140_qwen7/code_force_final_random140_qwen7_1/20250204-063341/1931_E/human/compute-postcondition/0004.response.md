Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `x`, `list_len`, and `int(list_len)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `y` is 0.
   - `rev_res` is an empty string.
   - `list_len` is a string.
   - `max_power` is a string.
   - `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of each string after removing trailing zeros.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs for `x` in the range of `int(list_len)`. This means `x` will take values from 0 to `int(list_len) - 1`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - `x` must be initialized to 0 because the loop starts with `x = 0`.
   - `list_len` must be a valid integer because `int(list_len)` will be used as the upper bound for the range function.
   - Since the loop will iterate based on the value of `int(list_len)`, `list_len` must be a non-empty string that can be converted to an integer.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `list_len`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 0, `list_len` must be a non-empty string that can be converted to an integer**
