Output State: **`y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts using the `split()` function and assigns them to `list_len` and `max_power`. Since the input is split, `list_len` and `max_power` are now strings. The values of `y` and `rev_res` remain unchanged.
