### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the game where players are removed based on positions defined by the sequence `p`.
   - For each initial number of players `n`, we need to determine how many players remain until no more players can be removed.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players from 1 to 100.
   - However, the implementation is flawed. The loop iterates over each possible initial number of players `n` and removes players according to the sequence `p`, but it does not correctly simulate the removal process. Specifically, `cur_n` is always reduced by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`, which leads to incorrect results. For example, if `p = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`, the function will incorrectly set `remaining_players[5]` to 0, instead of correctly determining the number of remaining players.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input, processes it using `func_1`, and outputs the results.
   - While the overall structure of `func_2` is correct, it relies on the incorrect implementation of `func_1`. Therefore, the results produced by `func_2` will also be incorrect.

4. **Checking Correctness:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the removal process. It incorrectly sets `remaining_players[n]` to 0 for all `n` due to the way `cur_n` is updated.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes the input and outputs the results, but the results are incorrect because `func_1` produces incorrect data.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if `p = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`, the function will incorrectly set `remaining_players[5]` to 0, instead of correctly determining the number of remaining players.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the removal process, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
