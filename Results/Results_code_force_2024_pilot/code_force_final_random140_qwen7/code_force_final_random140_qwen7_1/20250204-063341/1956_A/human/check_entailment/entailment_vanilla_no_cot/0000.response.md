To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and implementation step by step.

### Analysis of `func_1`

1. **Initialization**: 
   ```python
   max_n = 100
   remaining_players = [0] * (max_n + 1)
   ```
   This initializes a list to store the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players from 1 to 100.

2. **Loop through each possible number of players**:
   ```python
   for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
       cur_n = n
       while cur_n >= min(p):
           count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)
           cur_n -= count
       remaining_players[n] = cur_n
   ```
   - For each number of players `n`, it tries to remove players according to the sequence `p`.
   - `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)` finds the position where `cur_n` would fit in the sorted list `p`. This gives the number of players to remove.
   - `cur_n -= count` reduces the current number of players by the count of players to remove.
   - `remaining_players[n] = cur_n` stores the final number of remaining players for `n`.

### Analysis of `func_2`

1. **Reading Input**:
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   results = []
   for _ in range(t):
       (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
       p = list(map(int, input().split()))
       qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads the length of the sequence `k`, the number of queries `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of queries `qs`.

2. **Calling `func_1` and Processing Results**:
   ```python
   remaining_players = func_1(p)
   res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]
   results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```
   - Calls `func_1` to get the remaining players for each initial number of players.
   - Uses the precomputed results to find the number of remaining players for each query.
   - Appends the results to the `results` list.

### Correctness Check

1. **Logic of `func_1`**:
   - The logic correctly simulates the removal of players according to the sequence `p`.
   - The use of `bisect.bisect_right` is appropriate for finding the position to remove players.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the number of players is less than the required index by simply skipping the removal.

3. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The function correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results in the required format.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct. The function `func_1` correctly computes the remaining players for each initial number of players, and `func_2` correctly processes the input and outputs the results.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**True**
