### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` initializes an array `remaining_players` of length 101, filled with zeros.
- It iterates over each possible number of players `n` from 1 to 101.
- For each `n`, it sets `cur_n` to `n` and repeatedly subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` until `cur_n` becomes 0.
- This subtraction operation is intended to simulate the removal of players based on the sequence `p`, but it does not correctly handle the skipping of players when their positions exceed the current number of players.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`.
- It calls `func_1` to get the `remaining_players` array.
- It then uses `qs` to extract the relevant elements from `remaining_players` and formats the results as required.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Incorrect Simulation of Player Removal**:
   - The main issue lies in the logic of `func_1`. The function does not correctly simulate the removal of players based on the sequence `p`. Instead of removing players in the correct order, it simply subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` without considering the actual positions of the players.
   - For example, if `p = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`, the function should remove players 3 and 5 in the first round, leaving players 1, 2, and 4. In the second round, player 4 should be removed, leaving players 1 and 2 as winners. However, the function incorrectly calculates the remaining players, leading to an incorrect result.

2. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the sequence `p = [3, 5]` and `n = 5` (as in the example provided in the problem statement).
     - Expected output: Players 3 and 5 are removed in the first round, leaving players 1, 2, and 4. In the second round, player 4 is removed, leaving players 1 and 2 as winners.
     - However, the program outputs `1` instead of `2`, indicating that it does not correctly simulate the removal of players.

3. **Detailed Debugging**:
   - When `n = 5` and `p = [3, 5]`, the program should simulate the removal of players 3 and 5 in the first round, leaving players 1, 2, and 4. In the second round, player 4 is removed, leaving players 1 and 2 as winners.
   - The program fails to correctly simulate this process, leading to an incorrect result.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in the game for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in the game.
