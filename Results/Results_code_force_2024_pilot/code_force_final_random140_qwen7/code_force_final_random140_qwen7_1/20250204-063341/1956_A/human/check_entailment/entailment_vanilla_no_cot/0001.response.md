### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the game where players are removed based on positions defined by the sequence `p`.
   - For each initial number of players `n`, we need to determine how many players remain after the game ends.

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **`func_1(p)`**: This function calculates the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players from 1 to 100.
     - It uses a list `remaining_players` to store the number of remaining players for each `n` from 1 to 100.
     - For each `n`, it iterates and removes players based on the positions specified by `p`.
     - The use of `bisect_right` helps find the position to remove players.
   - **`func_2()`**: This function processes the input and calls `func_1(p)` to get the results for each test case.

3. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1(p)` correctly simulates the removal process for each `n` from 1 to 100.
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input, calls `func_1(p)` for each test case, and constructs the output correctly.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The function handles the maximum limit of players (100) correctly.
   - The logic for removing players based on the sequence `p` is sound and implemented correctly using `bisect_right`.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirement, where for each test case, the results are joined into a single string separated by spaces.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
