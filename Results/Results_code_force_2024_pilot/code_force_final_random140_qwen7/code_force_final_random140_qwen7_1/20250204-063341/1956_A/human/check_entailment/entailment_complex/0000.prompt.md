Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

# Annotated Functions:
import bisect

output = func_2()
for result in output:
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is a sorted list of positive integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p) - 1] <= 100.
def func_1(p):
    max_n = 100
    remaining_players = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        cur_n = n
        
        while cur_n >= min(p):
            count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)
            cur_n -= count
        
        remaining_players[n] = cur_n
        
    #State: Output State: `remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements are 0, `n` is 101, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `n = 1` to `n = max_n`, which in this case is 101. After each iteration, `cur_n` is set to `n` and then reduced by the value of `count`, which is determined by the `bisect.bisect_right` function. However, since `p` is not defined in the provided information and the initial conditions suggest that `p` is a list of minimum player counts, and given that `cur_n` is always reduced until it becomes 0, the final state of `remaining_players` will have all elements as 0 by the end of the loop. The variable `n` will reach 101 after the last iteration, and `cur_n` and `count` will both be 0 at that point.
    return remaining_players
    #`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements are 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of positive integers `p` where each element is between 1 and 100, inclusive. It initializes a list `remaining_players` of length 101 with all elements set to 0. For each integer `n` from 1 to 101, it updates `cur_n` to `n` and repeatedly subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` until `cur_n` becomes 0. Finally, it stores the result in `remaining_players[n]`. After completing these operations for all `n`, the function returns `remaining_players`, which is a list of length 101 where all elements are 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100; p is a list of k integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100; qs is a list of q integers representing n_i where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        remaining_players = func_1(p)
        
        res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]
        
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer indicating the total number of iterations the loop will execute. After all iterations, `k` and `q` will be the last integers input split for each iteration, `p` will be the last list of integers obtained from the input split for `p`, `qs` will be the last list of integers obtained from the input split for `qs`, `remaining_players` will be the return value of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, `res` will be a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs` for the last iteration, and `results` will be a list containing strings which are the results of joining the elements of `res` with spaces for each iteration, forming a list of length `t`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the final input integer provided, `k` and `q` will be the last two integers input split, `p` will be the last list of integers input for `p`, `qs` will be the last list of integers input for `qs`, `remaining_players` will be the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, `res` will contain the indexed elements from `remaining_players` based on `qs` for the last iteration, and `results` will be a list of space-separated strings, each corresponding to the results of `res` for each iteration.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings, each string being a space-separated list of elements from the last `remaining_players` list indexed by the corresponding `qs` list for each iteration, with `t` being the final input integer provided, `k` and `q` being the last two integers input split, `p` being the last list of integers input for `p`, `qs` being the last list of integers input for `qs`, `remaining_players` being the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, and `res` containing the indexed elements from `remaining_players` based on `qs` for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple iterations of inputs, where in each iteration, it reads values for `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. It then calls another function `func_1` to get the remaining players based on `p`. Using `qs`, it extracts specific elements from the result of `func_1` and stores these in a list. Finally, it formats these lists into space-separated strings and collects them into a list of results, which it returns.
