### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the game where players are removed based on positions defined by the sequence `p`.
   - For each initial number of players `n`, we need to determine how many players remain until no more players can be removed.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players from 1 to 100.
   - It uses a list `remaining_players` to store the number of remaining players for each initial number of players.
   - The loop iterates over each possible initial number of players `n` and removes players according to the sequence `p`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input, processes it using `func_1`, and outputs the results.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the precomputed remaining players and then uses these to determine the final number of remaining players for each initial player count `n`.

4. **Checking Correctness:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the removal process for each initial number of players.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes the input and outputs the results.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the maximum possible number of players (100) and the minimum (1).
   - It correctly skips players that do not exist in the current lineup.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all specified edge cases and performs the necessary operations accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
