Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating a game where players are removed based on a sequence of positions (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_k`). We need to determine how many players remain after all possible removals in each test case.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` initializes a list `remaining_players` of size 101 (to handle up to 100 players plus an extra index).
   - It iterates over each possible number of players `n` from 1 to 100.
   - For each `n`, it uses a while loop to remove players based on the sequence `p`. The key operation here is using `bisect.bisect_right` to find the position in `p` and subtract the count of players to be removed from `cur_n`.
   - The loop continues until `cur_n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, followed by the sequence `p` and the list `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` with `p` to get the `remaining_players` list.
   - It then constructs the result list by indexing into `remaining_players` using elements from `qs`.
   - Finally, it formats the results as space-separated strings and appends them to `results`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the removal process for each possible number of players.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes each test case and formats the results as required.
   - The use of `bisect.bisect_right` ensures that the correct number of players are removed in each step.

Given the logical flow and the correct implementation of the required operations, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
