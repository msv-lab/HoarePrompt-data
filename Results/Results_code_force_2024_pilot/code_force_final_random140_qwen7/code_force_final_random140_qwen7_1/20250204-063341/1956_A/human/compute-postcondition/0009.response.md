Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop will run `t` times.

2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head does not explicitly mention any variables. However, it runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations. Since `t` is a constant determined before the loop starts, it does not change within the loop.

3. **Determine the variables that need adjustment**: The only variable that changes with each iteration of the loop is the internal counter `_`. However, since the loop uses `range(t)`, the counter `_` will increment from 0 to `t-1`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must remain the same as it was at the start of the loop. There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment.

5. **State the new state**: Since no other variables in the loop head need adjustment, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` (elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`), `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`**
