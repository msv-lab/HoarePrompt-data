Output State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 0, and `count` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `count` is assigned the value returned by `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)`. Given that `cur_n` is 0 and all elements in the list `p` starting from index 1 are 0 (implying that `p[1]` and subsequent elements are 0), `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)` will return 0 because there are no elements in `p` that are greater than `cur_n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
