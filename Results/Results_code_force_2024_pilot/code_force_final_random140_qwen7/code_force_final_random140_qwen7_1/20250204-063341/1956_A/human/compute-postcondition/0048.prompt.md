You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is a sorted list of positive integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p) - 1] <= 100.
def func_1(p):
    max_n = 100
    remaining_players = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        cur_n = n
        
        while cur_n >= min(p):
            count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)
            cur_n -= count
        
        remaining_players[n] = cur_n
        
    #State: Output State: `remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements are 0, `n` is 101, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `n = 1` to `n = max_n`, which in this case is 101. After each iteration, `cur_n` is set to `n` and then reduced by the value of `count`, which is determined by the `bisect.bisect_right` function. However, since `p` is not defined in the provided information and the initial conditions suggest that `p` is a list of minimum player counts, and given that `cur_n` is always reduced until it becomes 0, the final state of `remaining_players` will have all elements as 0 by the end of the loop. The variable `n` will reach 101 after the last iteration, and `cur_n` and `count` will both be 0 at that point.
    return remaining_players
    #`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements are 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter p, which is a sorted list of positive integers where each element is between 1 and 100, inclusive, and in increasing order. The function returns a list of length 101, where all elements are 0.

```

Return Postconditions: `remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements are 0


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
