You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100; p is a list of k integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100; qs is a list of q integers representing n_i where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        remaining_players = func_1(p)
        
        res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]
        
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer indicating the total number of iterations the loop will execute. After all iterations, `k` and `q` will be the last integers input split for each iteration, `p` will be the last list of integers obtained from the input split for `p`, `qs` will be the last list of integers obtained from the input split for `qs`, `remaining_players` will be the return value of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, `res` will be a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs` for the last iteration, and `results` will be a list containing strings which are the results of joining the elements of `res` with spaces for each iteration, forming a list of length `t`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the final input integer provided, `k` and `q` will be the last two integers input split, `p` will be the last list of integers input for `p`, `qs` will be the last list of integers input for `qs`, `remaining_players` will be the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, `res` will contain the indexed elements from `remaining_players` based on `qs` for the last iteration, and `results` will be a list of space-separated strings, each corresponding to the results of `res` for each iteration.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings, each string being a space-separated list of elements from the last `remaining_players` list indexed by the corresponding `qs` list for each iteration, with `t` being the final input integer provided, `k` and `q` being the last two integers input split, `p` being the last list of integers input for `p`, `qs` being the last list of integers input for `qs`, `remaining_players` being the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, and `res` containing the indexed elements from `remaining_players` based on `qs` for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on the context of previous function calls, specifically the values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. It returns a list of strings, each string being a space-separated list of elements from the last `remaining_players` list indexed by the corresponding `qs` list for each iteration.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of strings, each string being a space-separated list of elements from the last `remaining_players` list indexed by the corresponding `qs` list for each iteration, with `t` being the final input integer provided, `k` and `q` being the last two integers input split, `p` being the last list of integers input for `p`, `qs` being the last list of integers input for `qs`, `remaining_players` being the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, and `res` containing the indexed elements from `remaining_players` based on `qs` for the last iteration.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
