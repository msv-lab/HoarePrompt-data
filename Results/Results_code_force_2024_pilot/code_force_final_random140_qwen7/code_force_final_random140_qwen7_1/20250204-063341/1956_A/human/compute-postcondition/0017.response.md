Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `k` is an integer input split, `q` is an integer input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split, `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` with spaces, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `k, q = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `k` and `q`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` and `q` now hold the values of the integers entered by the user, while the rest of the variables retain their previous states.
