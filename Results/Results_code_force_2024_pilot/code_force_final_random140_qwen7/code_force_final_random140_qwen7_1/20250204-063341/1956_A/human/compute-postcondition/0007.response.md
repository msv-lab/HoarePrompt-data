Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `results` is an empty list, `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`**.

Explanation: The code creates a list comprehension where each element in the new list `res` is taken from the list `remaining_players` using the indices specified in the list `qs`. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `results`, and `remaining_players` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `res` is constructed based on the indices provided in `qs` and the corresponding elements in `remaining_players`.
