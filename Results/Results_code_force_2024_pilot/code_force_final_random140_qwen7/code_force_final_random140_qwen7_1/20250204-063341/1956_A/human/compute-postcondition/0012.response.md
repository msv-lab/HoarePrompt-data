Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` is the first integer input split, `q` is the second integer input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` (elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`), `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(list(map(int, input().split())))`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `qs`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
