Output State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is the index of the first element in `remaining_players` that is greater than `cur_n`.**

Explanation: Initially, `cur_n` is set to 3. The line `cur_n -= count` subtracts the value of `count` from `cur_n`. Since `count` is the index of the first element in `remaining_players` that is greater than `cur_n`, and all elements starting from index 1 are 0 (which means no element is greater than 3), `count` would be 101 (beyond the list length, indicating no such element exists). However, since the subtraction operation is performed and `cur_n` was initially 3, `cur_n` becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
