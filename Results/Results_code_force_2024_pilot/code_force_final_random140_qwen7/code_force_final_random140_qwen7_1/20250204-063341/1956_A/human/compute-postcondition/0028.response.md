Output State: `remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 2, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `cur_n` will be reduced to 0 because it starts at 2 and decreases by the value of `count` in each iteration. The condition `cur_n >= min(remaining_players)` will eventually fail when `cur_n` becomes 0, as `min(remaining_players)` will be 0 (since all elements from index 1 onwards are 0). Therefore, the loop terminates when `cur_n` reaches 0. At this point, all elements in `remaining_players` from index 1 onwards will be 0, and `count` will be the last value it was assigned during the loop's execution, which is 0 in this case since `cur_n` is set to 0 before the final iteration.
