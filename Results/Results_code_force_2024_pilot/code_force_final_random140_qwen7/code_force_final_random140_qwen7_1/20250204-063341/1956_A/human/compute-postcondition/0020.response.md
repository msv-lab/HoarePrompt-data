Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `t` is `t-1`, `k` is an integer input split, `q` is an integer input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` with spaces, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `remaining_players = func_1(p)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(p)` to the variable `remaining_players`. However, since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `remaining_players`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
