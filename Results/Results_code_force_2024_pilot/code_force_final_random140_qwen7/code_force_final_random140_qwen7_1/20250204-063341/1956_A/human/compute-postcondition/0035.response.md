Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while cur_n >= min(p)`. The variables involved in this condition are `cur_n` and `min(p)`.

2. **Understand the Current State**:
   - `remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0.
   - `n` is 3.
   - `cur_n` is 0.
   - `count` is the index of the first element in `remaining_players` that is greater than `cur_n`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `cur_n >= min(p)` must be true at the start of the next iteration.
   - Currently, `cur_n` is 0. Therefore, `min(p)` must be less than or equal to 0 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `cur_n` is 0, the only way to satisfy the condition `cur_n >= min(p)` is to ensure that `min(p)` is less than or equal to 0.
   - The state of `cur_n` itself cannot be changed because the loop condition depends on the value of `min(p)`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that `min(p)` is less than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `min(p)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is the index of the first element in `remaining_players` that is greater than `cur_n`, and `min(p)` must be less than or equal to 0**.
