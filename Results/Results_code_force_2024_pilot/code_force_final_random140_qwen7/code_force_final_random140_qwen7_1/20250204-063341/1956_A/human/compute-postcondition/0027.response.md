Functionality: **The function processes multiple iterations of inputs, where in each iteration, it reads values for `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. It then calls another function `func_1` to get the remaining players based on `p`. Using `qs`, it extracts specific elements from the result of `func_1` and stores these in a list. Finally, it formats these lists into space-separated strings and collects them into a list of results, which it returns.**
