Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while cur_n >= min(p)`. The variables involved here are `cur_n` and `min(p)`.

2. **Understand the Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `cur_n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in the list `p`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0.
   - `n` is 3.
   - `cur_n` is 3.
   - `count` is 0.

4. **Determine the Initial Value of `min(p)`**:
   - Since all elements starting from index 1 of `remaining_players` are 0, the minimum value in the list `p` (assuming `p` refers to `remaining_players`) is 0.

5. **Check the Condition**:
   - The condition for the loop is `cur_n >= min(p)`.
   - Currently, `cur_n` is 3 and `min(p)` is 0.
   - Therefore, `cur_n` (3) is indeed greater than or equal to `min(p)` (0), so the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

Since no adjustments are needed to make the loop execute the first time based on the given conditions, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 3, `count` is 0**
