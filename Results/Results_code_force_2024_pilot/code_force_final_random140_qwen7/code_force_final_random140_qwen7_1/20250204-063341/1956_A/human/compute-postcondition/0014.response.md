Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` is the first integer input split, `q` is the second integer input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split, `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `res` by indexing into `remaining_players` using the elements in `qs`. This does not change the values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `remaining_players`, or `res`. The `remaining_players` variable remains unchanged and is still the return value of `func_1(p)`. The `res` list is now populated with elements from `remaining_players` based on the indices specified in `qs`.
