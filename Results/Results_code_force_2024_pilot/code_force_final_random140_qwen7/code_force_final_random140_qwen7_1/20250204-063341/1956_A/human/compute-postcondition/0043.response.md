Output State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is 0, `remaining_players[3]` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `remaining_players[n] = cur_n` assigns the value of `cur_n` (which is 0) to the index `n` (which is 3) in the list `remaining_players`. All other variables and the state of `remaining_players` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `remaining_players[3]` being set to 0, while the rest of the list remains as initially described.
