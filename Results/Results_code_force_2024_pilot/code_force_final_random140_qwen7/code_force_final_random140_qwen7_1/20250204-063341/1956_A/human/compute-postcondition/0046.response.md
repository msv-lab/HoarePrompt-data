Output State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements are 0**

This means that after the loop completes, the list `remaining_players` has been modified such that all 101 elements are set to 0. The loop iterated from `n = 1` to `n = 101`, and during each iteration, `cur_n` was set to `n` and then reduced by the value of `count`, which was determined by the `bisect.bisect_right` function. Since `p` is not defined in the provided information and the context suggests that `p` is a list of minimum player counts, and given that `cur_n` is always reduced until it becomes 0, the final state of `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros.
