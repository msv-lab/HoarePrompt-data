Output State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is -count, `count` is the index of the first element in `remaining_players` that is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `cur_n -= count` subtracts the value of `count` from `cur_n`. Since `count` is the index of the first element in `remaining_players` that is greater than 0, and all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `count` remains unchanged (it is still the index of the first element that would be greater than 0 if it existed). Thus, `cur_n` is updated to `-count`. All other variables and their states remain the same.
