Output State: `remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is 0.

Explanation: After the first three iterations of the loop, `cur_n` becomes 0 because it is continuously being decremented by the value of `count`, which is the index of the first element in `remaining_players` that is greater than `cur_n`. Since `remaining_players` is initialized such that all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)` will always return 0 or a positive index, but since `cur_n` is 0, the decrement operation will eventually make `cur_n` stay at 0. Therefore, after all iterations, `cur_n` remains 0, and `count` also remains 0 as there are no more elements in `remaining_players` that are greater than `cur_n`. The other variables (`n` and the state of `remaining_players`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
