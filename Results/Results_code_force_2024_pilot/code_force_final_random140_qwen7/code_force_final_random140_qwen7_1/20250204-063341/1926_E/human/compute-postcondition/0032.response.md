The variables in the loop head are `p` and `i`. The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`
- `h` is halved towards zero (integer division)
- `p` is increased by 1

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`. Since `p` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, `p` must have been less than `i - 1` before the increase. Therefore, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 2` after the increase.

No other states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2; h is halved towards zero (integer division); p must be less than or equal to i - 2**
