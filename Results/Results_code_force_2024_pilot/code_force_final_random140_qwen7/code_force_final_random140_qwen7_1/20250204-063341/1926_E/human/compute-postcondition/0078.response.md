Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down) and then decreased by (h + 1) // 2, `i` must be at least 3, `p` is increased by 1, `p` is now p + 1**.

Explanation: The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `g` remains increased by `(h + 1) // 2`, `h` remains halved (rounded down) and then decreased by `(h + 1) // 2`, `i` must still be at least 3, and `p` is now increased by 1.
