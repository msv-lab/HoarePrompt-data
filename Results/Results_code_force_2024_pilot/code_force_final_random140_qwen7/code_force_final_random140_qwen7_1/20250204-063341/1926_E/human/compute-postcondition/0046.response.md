Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is either 1 or `n`, `h` is either `n // 8` or `n`, `p` is either 4 or 1, `g` is either \((n + 1) // 2 + (n // 8 + 1) // 2 + (n // 16 + 1) // 2\) or 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**

Explanation: The line `s = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
