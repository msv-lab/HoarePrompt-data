Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part. This means the loop will run based on the integer input from the user.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either 4 or 0.
   - `n` is the integer input from the user.
   - `k` is an integer input from the user.
   - `s` is either 4 or 0.
   - `d` is either 1 or `n`.
   - `h` is either `n // 8` or `n`.
   - `p` is either 4 or 1.
   - `g` is either \((n + 1) // 2 + (n // 8 + 1) // 2 + (n // 16 + 1) // 2\) or 0.
   - `f` is either `k - g` or undefined.
   - `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as the input to `range()` is a positive integer. Therefore, the loop will execute again if the user inputs a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on the input from the user, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, `y`) will be recalculated based on the new input.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new state should reflect that the loop will execute again if the user inputs a positive integer. Let's denote the new input as `new_n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is either 4 or 0, `n` is `new_n`, `k` is `new_k`, `s` is either 4 or 0, `d` is either 1 or `new_n`, `h` is either `new_n // 8` or `new_n`, `p` is either 4 or 1, `g` is either \((new_n + 1) // 2 + (new_n // 8 + 1) // 2 + (new_n // 16 + 1) // 2\) or 0, `f` is either `new_k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (new_k - g)\) or undefined.**

However, since the exact values of `new_n` and `new_k` are not specified, we can generalize the state as follows:

**State: `i` is either 4 or 0, `n` is the new integer input from the user, `k` is the new integer input from the user, `s` is either 4 or 0, `d` is either 1 or the new integer input from the user, `h` is either the new integer input from the user // 8 or the new integer input from the user, `p` is either 4 or 1, `g` is either \((\text{new integer input} + 1) // 2 + (\text{new integer input} // 8 + 1) // 2 + (\text{new integer input} // 16 + 1) // 2\) or 0, `f` is either \(\text{new integer input} - g\) or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (\text{new integer input} - g)\) or undefined.**
