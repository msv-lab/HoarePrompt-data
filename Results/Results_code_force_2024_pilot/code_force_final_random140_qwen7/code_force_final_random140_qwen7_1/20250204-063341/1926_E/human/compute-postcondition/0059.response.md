Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than \((n // 2)\), `s` is \((d + 1) // 2\), `d` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `s`, and `d`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
