The code `g += (h + 1) // 2` updates the value of `g` by adding `(h + 1) // 2` to its current value. From the initial state, we know that `h` is equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Let's calculate `(h + 1) // 2`:

\[ h = n - \left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right) \]
\[ h + 1 = n - \left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right) + 1 = n - \frac{n + 1}{2} + 1 = \frac{2n - (n + 1) + 2}{2} = \frac{n + 1}{2} \]
\[ (h + 1) // 2 = \left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right) // 2 \]

Since `n` is an integer greater than 0, `(n + 1) // 2` is also an integer. Adding 1 to it and then performing integer division by 2 will give us the same value as `g` was initially set to, which is `(h + 1) // 2`.

Therefore, `g` is updated to its current value plus itself, which means `g` doubles its value.

Output State: **`i` must be greater than 3, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `p` is 2, `g` is doubled from its initial value, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**
