Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 1, `s` is 2, `d` is `n // 4`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**

Explanation: The initial value of `d` is `n // 2`. After executing `d -= (d + 1) // 2`, we substitute `d` with its initial value:

- Initial `d` is `n // 2`.
- `(d + 1) // 2` becomes `((n // 2) + 1) // 2`.

Simplifying the expression:

- `((n // 2) + 1) // 2` equals `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`.

So, `d` is updated to:

- `d -= (n // 2 + 1) // 2` which means `d` becomes `n // 2 - (n // 2 + 1) // 2`.

This simplifies to:

- `d` becomes `n // 4`.

All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
