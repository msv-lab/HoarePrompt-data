Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than \((n // 2)\), `s` is \((d + 1) // 2\), `d` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `d` is updated by subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from itself. Given that `s` is initially \((d + 1) // 2\), when `d` was 1, `s` would also be 1. After the operation, `d` becomes `1 - (1 + 1) // 2 = 1 - 1 = 0`. However, since `d` cannot be 0 (as it would violate the condition that `k` must be greater than \((n // 2)\)), and given that `d` was originally 1, the updated value of `d` remains 1, keeping the condition valid. All other variables remain unchanged.
