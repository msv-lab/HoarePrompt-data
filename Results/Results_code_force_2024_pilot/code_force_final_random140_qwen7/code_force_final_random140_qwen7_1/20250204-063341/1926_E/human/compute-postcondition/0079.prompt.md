Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, `n` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is now `n`, `k` is an integer input from the user, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`. The variable `s` accumulates the sum of `(d + 1) // 2` in each iteration until `s` reaches or exceeds `k`. Given the output state after the third iteration, we can infer that `s` will reach `k` exactly when `d` becomes 0, which happens after 3 iterations in this case. Since the loop condition `s < k and d > 0` ensures that `d` decreases by half of itself plus one in each iteration, and considering the pattern observed, `s` will be equal to `k` when the loop terminates. Therefore, `s` will be `k` and `d` will be 0 after all iterations.
Code of the loop:
while p <= i - 1:
    g += (h + 1) // 2
    h -= (h + 1) // 2
    p += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down), `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, and the minimum value between `k` and `n` must be at least 2; `p` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down) and then decreased by (h + 1) // 2, `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, and the minimum value between `k` and `n` must be at least 2; `p` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down) and then decreased by (h + 1) // 2, `i` must be at least 3, `p` is increased by 1, `p` is now p + 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
