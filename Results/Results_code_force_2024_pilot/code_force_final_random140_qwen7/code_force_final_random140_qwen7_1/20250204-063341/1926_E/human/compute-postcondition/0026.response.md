Output State: **`i` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than 0 and divisible by \(4^{(i-1)}\), `k` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\), `s` is `i`, `d` is 1, `h` is now equal to \(\frac{n}{2}\), `p` is 1, `g` is \((n + 1) // 2\).**

Explanation: The line `h -= (h + 1) // 2` subtracts \((h + 1) // 2\) from `h`. Given that `h` was originally equal to `n`, after the operation, `h` becomes \(n - \frac{n + 1}{2} = \frac{2n - n - 1}{2} = \frac{n - 1}{2} = \frac{n}{2}\) since \(n\) is even (as it is divisible by \(4^{(i-1)}\)). All other variables remain unchanged.
