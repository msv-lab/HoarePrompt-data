Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 5.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `k` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `s` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's logic, but no specific value is given.
   - `d` is 0.
   - `h` is reduced to 0.
   - `p` is 5.
   - `g` is the final value calculated after 4 iterations.
   - `f` is `k - g`.
   - `y` is \(2^4 \times (k - g)\).

2. **Understanding `y`:**
   - The expression for `y` is \(2^4 \times (k - g)\).
   - \(2^4 = 16\).
   - Therefore, `y` simplifies to \(16 \times (k - g)\).

3. **Value of `y`:**
   - Since `g` is the result of 4 iterations, and no specific value for `g` is provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `y` without knowing `k` and `g`.
   - However, based on the given formula, `y` will be `16 * (k - g)`.

Given this analysis, the print statement will output the value of `y`, which is \(16 \times (k - g)\).

Output: **16 * (k - g)**
