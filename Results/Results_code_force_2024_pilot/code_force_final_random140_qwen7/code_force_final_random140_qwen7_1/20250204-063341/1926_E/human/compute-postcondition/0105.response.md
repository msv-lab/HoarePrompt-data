The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 3. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `d`, `s`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as per the initial conditions.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer and must satisfy \(\left(\frac{n + 3}{2}\right) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2 < k\) and \( n > -1 \), `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `d` is decreased by \((d + 1) // 2\), `s` is \(\left(\frac{n + 3}{2}\right) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2\), `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**
