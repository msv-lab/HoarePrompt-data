Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down), `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, and the minimum value between `k` and `n` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `g` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `g`.
- The value of `h` is updated by subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from itself. This means `h` is effectively halved and rounded down.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `i`.
- The condition that the minimum value between `k` and `n` must be at least 2 is still valid.
