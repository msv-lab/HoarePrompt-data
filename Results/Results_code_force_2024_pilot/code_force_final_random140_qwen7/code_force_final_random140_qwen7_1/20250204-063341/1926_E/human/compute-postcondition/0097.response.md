Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is (d + 1) // 2, `d` is now (n + 1) // 2, `h` is now `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
