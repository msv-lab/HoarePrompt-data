Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `s < k and d > 0`.
2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `s`, `k`, `d`, and `h`. However, since `h` does not appear in the loop condition, it does not need to be considered for adjustment.
3. **Check the current state**:
   - `i` is 1 (not part of the loop condition).
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (not part of the loop condition).
   - `k` is an integer input from the user (not part of the loop condition).
   - `s` is 1.
   - `d` is `n // 2`.
   - `h` is `n`.
   - `p` is 1 (not part of the loop condition).
   - `g` is 0 (not part of the loop condition).

4. **Evaluate the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `s` must be less than `k` and `d` must be greater than 0.
   - Currently, `s` is 1. To satisfy `s < k`, `k` must be greater than 1.
   - Currently, `d` is `n // 2`. For `d > 0`, `n` must be greater than 0, which is already given.

Since `s` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1 for the condition `s < k` to hold true. Additionally, `d` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied as long as `n > 0`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 1, `s` is 1, `d` is `n // 2`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**
