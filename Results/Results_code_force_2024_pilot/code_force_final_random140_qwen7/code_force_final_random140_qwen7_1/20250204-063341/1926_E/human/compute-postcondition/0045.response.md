Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is either 4 or 0, `d` is either 1 or `n`, `h` is either `n // 8` or `n`, `p` is either 4 or 1, `g` is either \((n + 1) // 2 + (n // 8 + 1) // 2 + (n // 16 + 1) // 2\) or 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the user's input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of the other variables (`i`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
