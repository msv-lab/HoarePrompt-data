Output State: **`i` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than 0 and divisible by \(4^{(i-1)}\), `k` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\), `s` is `i`, `d` is 1, `h` is now equal to \(\frac{n}{2}\), `p` is 2, `g` is \((n + 1) // 2\).**

Explanation: The value of `p` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
