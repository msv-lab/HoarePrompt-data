Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is (d + 1) // 2, `d` is now (n + 1) // 2, `h` is now `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined**

Explanation: The code `d -= (d + 1) // 2` updates the value of `d` by subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from it. Given that `d` is initially equal to `n`, after the operation, `d` becomes `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
