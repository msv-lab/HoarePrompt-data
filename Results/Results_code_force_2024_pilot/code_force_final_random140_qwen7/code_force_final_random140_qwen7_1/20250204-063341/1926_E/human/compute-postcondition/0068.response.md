Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, and the minimum value between `k` and `n` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `g` by adding `(h + 1) // 2` to its current value. The variables `i`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `i` still being the minimum value between `k` and `n`, and the condition that this minimum value must be at least 2.
