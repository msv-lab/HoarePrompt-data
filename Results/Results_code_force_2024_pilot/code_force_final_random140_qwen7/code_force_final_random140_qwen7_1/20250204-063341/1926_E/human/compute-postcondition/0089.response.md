Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is now `n`, `h` is now `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined, and the integer input from the user is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. Since `i` was already 0 in the initial state, this does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The integer input from the user is also decreased by 1, but since the exact value of the input was not specified, it remains as "an integer input from the user" with the understanding that it has been decremented by 1.
