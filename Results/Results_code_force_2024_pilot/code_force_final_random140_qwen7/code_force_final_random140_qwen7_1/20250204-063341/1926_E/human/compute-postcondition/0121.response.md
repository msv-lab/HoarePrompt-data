Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's logic, `d` is 0, `h` is reduced to 0, `p` is 5, `g` is the final value calculated after 4 iterations, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(5 - 1)} * (k - g)\) if `g` is less than `k`.**

Explanation: The code `f = k - g` simply assigns the value of `k - g` to `f`. Since `g` is the final value calculated after 4 iterations, and `k` is an integer greater than 0, `f` is updated to be `k - g`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
