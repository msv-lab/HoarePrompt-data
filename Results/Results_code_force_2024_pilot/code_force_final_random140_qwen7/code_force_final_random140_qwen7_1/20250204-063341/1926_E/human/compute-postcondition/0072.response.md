Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down), `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, and the minimum value between `k` and `n` must be at least 2; `p` must be such that p + 1 <= i - 1**.

Explanation: The code `g += (h + 1) // 2` increments `g` by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`. The values of `h` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the conditions for `i` and `p` are still valid. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `g` by `(h + 1) // 2`.
