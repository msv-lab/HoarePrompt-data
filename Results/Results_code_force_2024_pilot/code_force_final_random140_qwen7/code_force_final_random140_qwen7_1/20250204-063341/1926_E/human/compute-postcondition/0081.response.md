Output State: **`i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, `s` is equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `p` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach `k`, `g` is the accumulated sum of `(h + 1) // 2` over all iterations, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is `2 ** (i - 1) * (k - g)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `y` the value of `2 ** (i - 1) * (k - g)`. Since `i` is the minimum value between `k` and `n`, and `g` is the accumulated sum of `(h + 1) // 2` over all iterations, `f` is `k - g`. Therefore, `y` is calculated using these values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
