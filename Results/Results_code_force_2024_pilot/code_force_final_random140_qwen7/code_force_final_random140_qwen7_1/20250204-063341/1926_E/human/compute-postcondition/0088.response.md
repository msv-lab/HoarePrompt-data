Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is now `n`, `h` is now `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined, and the integer input from the user is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `s = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The integer input from the user is also decreased by 1, but since the problem does not specify what happens to this input after it is used, we only note its initial state and that it is now decreased by 1.
