Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is now `n`, `h` is now `n`, `k` is an integer input from the user, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined. If `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), then `i` is set to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, `s` is set to `k`, `d` and `h` are both set to 0, and `p` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach `k`, with `g` being the accumulated sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) over all iterations, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is `2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)`. If `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), then `i` remains 0.**
