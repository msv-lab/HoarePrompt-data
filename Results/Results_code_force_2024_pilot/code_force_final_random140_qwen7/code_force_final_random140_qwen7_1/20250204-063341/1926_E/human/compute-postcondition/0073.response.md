Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down) and then decreased by (h + 1) // 2, `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, and the minimum value between `k` and `n` must be at least 2; `p` must be such that p + 1 <= i - 1**.

Explanation: The code `h -= (h + 1) // 2` decreases the value of `h` by `(h + 1) // 2`. Since `h` was initially halved (rounded down) and then had `(h + 1) // 2` subtracted from it, `h` is now further reduced. However, the initial conditions and relationships between `i`, `k`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.
