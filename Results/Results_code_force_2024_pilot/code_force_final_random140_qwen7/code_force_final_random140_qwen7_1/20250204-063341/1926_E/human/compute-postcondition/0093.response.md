Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is now `n`, `h` is now `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**

Explanation: The code sets `g` to 0. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `f`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
