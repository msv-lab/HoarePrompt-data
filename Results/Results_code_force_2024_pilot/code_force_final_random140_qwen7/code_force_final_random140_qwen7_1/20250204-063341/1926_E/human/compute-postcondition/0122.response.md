Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's logic, `d` is 0, `h` is reduced to 0, `p` is 5, `g` is the final value calculated after 4 iterations, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is \(2^{4} * (k - g)\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `y` to be \(2^{(i - 1)} \times f\). Given that `i` is 5, `2^{(i - 1)}` becomes \(2^4\), which equals 16. The value of `f` remains unchanged as it was previously defined as `k - g`. Therefore, `y` is now updated to be \(16 \times (k - g)\). All other variables remain in their initial or previously calculated states.
