Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `s < k and d > 0`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `k` must be greater than `(n // 2)`
   - `s` is \((d + 1) // 2\)
   - `d` is 1

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition involves `s` and `d`.
   - We need to ensure that `s < k` and `d > 0` for the loop to continue.

4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - Given `d` is 1, `d > 0` is already true.
   - For `s < k`, we need to check the current values of `s` and `k`.

5. **Calculate `s`**:
   - Since `d` is 1, `s = (d + 1) // 2 = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`.

6. **Check the condition `s < k`**:
   - `s` is 1.
   - `k` must be greater than \((n // 2)\).
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 2. Therefore, \(n // 2 = 1\), and `k` must be greater than 1.
   - For `s < k` to be true, `k` must be greater than 1.

7. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `d` is already greater than 0, no change is needed for `d`.
   - To satisfy `s < k`, `k` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `s` is 1, `d` is 1**
