Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2; h is halved towards zero (integer division); p is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The variable `p` is incremented by 1. The values of `g` and `h` remain as per their previous operations. Therefore, `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2` and `h` is halved towards zero using integer division. The value of `p` is now increased by 1.
