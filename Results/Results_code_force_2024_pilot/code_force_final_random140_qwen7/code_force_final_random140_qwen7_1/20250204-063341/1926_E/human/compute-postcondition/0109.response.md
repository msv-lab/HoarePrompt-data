Output State: **`i` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration, `d` is 0, `h` remains `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is updated to `(h + 1) // 2`, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**

Explanation: The code `g += (h + 1) // 2` updates the value of `g` to be the current value of `g` plus the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2. Since `h` remains `n`, the new value of `g` is `n + 1` divided by 2, which is the floor division result. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
