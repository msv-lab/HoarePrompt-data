Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down) and then decreased by (h + 1) // 2, `i` must be at least 3, and `p` is increased by 1, h is now h - (h + 1) // 2.**

Explanation: The code `h -= (h + 1) // 2` subtracts `(h + 1) // 2` from `h`. This means `h` is first halved (rounded down), and then `(h + 1) // 2` is subtracted from the result. The initial state of `h` being halved and then decreased by `(h + 1) // 2` results in `h` being reduced by `(h + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
