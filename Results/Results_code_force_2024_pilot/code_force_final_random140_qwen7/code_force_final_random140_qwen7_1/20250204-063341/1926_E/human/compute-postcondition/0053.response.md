Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is (d + 1) // 2, `d` is now `n`, `h` is now `n`, `k` is an integer input from the user, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `s` by adding `(d + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since `d` is initially set to `n`, `s` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
