Postcondition: **`i` is either 4 or 0, `n` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is either 4 or 0, `d` is either 1 or `n`, `h` is either \(n // 8\) or `n`, `p` is either 4 or 1, `g` is either \((n + 1) // 2 + (n // 8 + 1) // 2 + (n // 16 + 1) // 2\) or 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `k > (n + 1) // 2` is true, then `i` becomes 4, `s` becomes 4, `p` becomes 4, `g` becomes \((n + 1) // 2 + (n // 8 + 1) // 2 + (n // 16 + 1) // 2\), and `y` becomes \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\). If the condition is false, then `i` remains 0, `s` remains 0, `p` remains 1, `g` remains 0, and `y` is undefined.
