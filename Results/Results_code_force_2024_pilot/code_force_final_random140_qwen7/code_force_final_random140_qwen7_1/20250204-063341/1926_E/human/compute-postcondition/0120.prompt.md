Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is determined by when `s` reaches or exceeds `k` and `d` becomes 0; `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration, calculated as \(\left(\frac{n + 3}{2}\right) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2 + ...\) until `s` no longer increases; `d` is 0 because it keeps decreasing by \((d + 1) // 2\) until it reaches 0; `h` remains `n`; `p` is 1; `g` is 0; `f` is either `k - g` or undefined; `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `i` will be the final count of how many times the loop ran, `s` will be the accumulated value based on the loop's logic, `d` will be 0, and `h` will still be the original value of `n`. The other variables (`p`, `g`, `f`, and `y`) will retain their initial or computed values depending on the loop's conditions.
Code of the loop:
while p <= i - 1:
    g += (h + 1) // 2
    h -= (h + 1) // 2
    p += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `p` is 2, `g` is updated to `(h + 1) // 2`, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` must be greater than 3, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to \((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2\), `p` is 3, `g` is doubled from its initial value, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` must be greater than 4, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to \((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2 - ((h + 1) // 2)\), `p` is 4, `g` is equal to its initial value plus \((h + 1) // 2\), `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
