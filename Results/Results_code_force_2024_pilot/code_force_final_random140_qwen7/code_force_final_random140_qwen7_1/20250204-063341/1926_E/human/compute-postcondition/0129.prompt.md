Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    i = 0
    d = n
    h = n
    p = 1
    g = 0
    if k > (n + 1) // 2:
        while s < k and d > 0:
            s += (d + 1) // 2
            d -= (d + 1) // 2
            i += 1
        while p <= i - 1:
            g += (h + 1) // 2
            h -= (h + 1) // 2
            p += 1
        f = k - g
        y = 2 ** (i - 1) * f
        print(y)
    else:
        print(2 * k - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is either 4 or 0, `n` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is either 4 or 0, `d` is either 1 or `n`, `h` is either \(n // 8\) or `n`, `p` is either 4 or 1, `g` is either \((n + 1) // 2 + (n // 8 + 1) // 2 + (n // 16 + 1) // 2\) or 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is now `n`, `h` is now `n`, `k` is an integer input from the user, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined. If `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), then `i` is set to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, `s` is set to `k`, `d` and `h` are both set to 0, and `p` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach `k`, with `g` being the accumulated sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) over all iterations, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is `2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)`. If `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), then `i` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 5 if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `i` is 0. `n` and `k` are as input from the user. `s` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's logic if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `s` is 0. `d` is 0 if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `d` is `n`. `h` is reduced to 0 if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `h` is `n`. `p` is 5 if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `p` is 1. `g` is the final value calculated after 4 iterations if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `g` is 0. `f` is `k - g` if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is undefined. `y` is \(2^4 * (k - g)\) if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `y` is undefined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
