Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `n` is an integer input from the user
- `k` is an integer input from the user
- `s` is 0
- `d` is now `n`
- `h` is now `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, but since `g` is 0, `f` is `k`
- `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined, and since `i` is 0, `y` is undefined

The expression `2 * k - 1` depends only on the value of `k`, which is an integer input from the user and is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **2 * k - 1**
