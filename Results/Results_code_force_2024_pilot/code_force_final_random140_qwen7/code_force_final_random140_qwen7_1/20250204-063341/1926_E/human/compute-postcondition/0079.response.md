Output State: **`i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, `s` is equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `p` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach `k`, `g` is the accumulated sum of `(h + 1) // 2` over all iterations, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will still be equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`. The variable `s` will reach exactly `k` because the loop condition `s < k and d > 0` ensures that `s` accumulates until it meets or exceeds `k`. At this point, `d` will be 0, and since `d` is used to control the loop, the loop will terminate. The variable `h` will be 0 because it is continuously halved and adjusted within the loop until it reaches 0. The variable `p` will be the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach `k`. The variable `g` will be the accumulated sum of `(h + 1) // 2` over all iterations. Variables `f` and `y` will remain undefined as they were not updated within the loop.
