Output State: **`i` is the total number of iterations, which is 4 since `n` is divisible by \(4^3 = 64\) and the loop runs until `s` equals `k`. `n` is still greater than 0 and divisible by 64. `k` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\). `s` is `i`, which is 4. `d` is 1. `h` is now `h // 2` after 3 iterations, which means `h` is \(n // 8\). `p` is `p + 3`, so `p` is 4. `g` has been incremented three times by \((h + 1) // 2\), so `g` is \((n + 1) // 2 + (n // 8 + 1) // 2 + (n // 16 + 1) // 2\).**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 4, `n` is still a large multiple of 64, `k` remains as an input greater than \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\), `s` is 4, `d` is 1, `h` is reduced to \(n // 8\), `p` is 4, and `g` is the sum of \((n + 1) // 2\), \((n // 8 + 1) // 2\), and \((n // 16 + 1) // 2\).
