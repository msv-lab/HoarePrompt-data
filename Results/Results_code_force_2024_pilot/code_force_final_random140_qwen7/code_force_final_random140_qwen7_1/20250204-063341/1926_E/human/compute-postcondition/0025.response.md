Output State: **`i` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than 0 and divisible by \(4^{(i-1)}\), `k` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\), `s` is `i`, `d` is 1, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is \((n + 1) // 2\).**

Explanation: The code `g += (h + 1) // 2` increments the value of `g` by \((h + 1) // 2\). Given that `h` is equal to `n`, the value of `g` is updated to \((n + 1) // 2\). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
