Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is (d + 1) // 2, `d` is now (n - 1), `h` is now `n`, `k` is an integer input from the user, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined**

Explanation: The code `d -= (d + 1) // 2` updates the value of `d` by subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from it. Given that `d` was initially equal to `n`, the new value of `d` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is an integer, `(n + 1) // 2` is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2, which results in the floor of the division. Therefore, `d` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, simplifying to `n - (n // 2 + 1)` or `(n - 1) // 2`. However, since the integer division of `n + 1` by 2 is simply `n // 2 + 1`, the simplified value of `d` is `n - (n // 2 + 1)`, which is `(n - 1) // 2`. But for simplicity, we can just say `d` is now `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
