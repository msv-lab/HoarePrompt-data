Postcondition: **`i` is 5 if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `i` is 0. `n` and `k` are as input from the user. `s` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's logic if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `s` is 0. `d` is 0 if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `d` is `n`. `h` is reduced to 0 if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `h` is `n`. `p` is 5 if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `p` is 1. `g` is the final value calculated after 4 iterations if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `g` is 0. `f` is `k - g` if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is undefined. `y` is \(2^4 * (k - g)\) if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `y` is undefined.**
