Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer and must satisfy \(\left(\frac{n + 3}{2}\right) // 2 < k\), `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is \(\left(\frac{n + 3}{2}\right) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2\), `d` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding \((d + 1) // 2\) to its current value. Given that \(d = (n + 1) // 2\), the new value of `s` becomes \(\left(\frac{n + 3}{2}\right) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2\). All other variables remain unchanged.
