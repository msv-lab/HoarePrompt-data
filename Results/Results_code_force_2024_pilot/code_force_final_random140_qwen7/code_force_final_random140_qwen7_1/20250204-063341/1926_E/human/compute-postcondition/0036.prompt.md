Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `n` must be greater than 0 and divisible by 4^(i-1), `k` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `s` is `i`, `d` is 1, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `s < k` and `d > 0`. Given the conditions after 3 iterations, we can infer that `n` must be a power of 4 times some integer (since `d` reduces by half each iteration and becomes 1 after 3 iterations, indicating `n` is divisible by \(4^3 = 64\)). The variable `k` must be greater than \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\) to ensure the loop runs until `s` reaches `k`. After all iterations, `i` will be the total number of iterations, `s` will equal `i`, `d` will be 1 (as it halves each time and becomes 1 after `log_2(n)` iterations), and the other variables (`h`, `p`, `g`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
while p <= i - 1:
    g += (h + 1) // 2
    h -= (h + 1) // 2
    p += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than 0 and divisible by \(4^{(i-1)}\), `k` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\), `s` is `i`, `d` is 1, `h` is now equal to \(\frac{n}{2}\), `p` is 2, `g` is \((n + 1) // 2\).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2; h is halved towards zero (integer division); p is increased by 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `h` is now equal to `h // 2`, `p` is `p + 1`, and `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
