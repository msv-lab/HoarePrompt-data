Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down) and then decreased by (h + 1) // 2, `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, and the minimum value between `k` and `n` must be at least 2; `p` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. The values of `g`, `h`, `i`, and the condition regarding `p` remain unchanged from the initial state except for the increment of `p`.
