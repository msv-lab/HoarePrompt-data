Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between \( n \), \( k \), and the number of iterations required to reach \( k \). If \( k \) is greater than half of \( n + 1 \), it computes a specific formula involving powers of 2. Otherwise, it simply prints \( 2k - 1 \). The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
