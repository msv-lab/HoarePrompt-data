Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`.
   - `h` is halved (rounded down).
   - `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`.
   - The minimum value between `k` and `n` must be at least 2.
   - `p` is increased by 1.

3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.

Given the current state:
- `g` has been updated.
- `h` has been updated.
- `i` is the minimum of `k` and `n`, and this minimum value is at least 2.
- `p` has been increased by 1.

To satisfy the loop condition `p <= i - 1` for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `p` is still within the bounds required by the loop.

Since `p` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `p` is `p + 1` from the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `p + 1` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.

So, we need to adjust the state such that `p + 1 <= i - 1`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `p + 1 <= i - 1`.

Given the constraints and the loop condition, the only state that needs adjustment is `p`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down), `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, and the minimum value between `k` and `n` must be at least 2; `p` must be such that p + 1 <= i - 1**
