Output State: `i` is equal to the number of iterations it took for the loop to finish, `n` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 1, `s` is equal to `k - 1`, `d` is 0, `h` is now `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.

Explanation: After the loop finishes executing, the value of `i` will be equal to the number of iterations it took for the loop to terminate. Given the conditions provided, the loop continues as long as `s < k` and `d > 0`. From the given output states, we can infer that the loop terminates when `d` becomes 0. The final state of `s` will be `k - 1` because `s` increases by `(d + 1) // 2` each iteration and decreases by the same amount, effectively incrementing by 1 each iteration until `d` reaches 0.
