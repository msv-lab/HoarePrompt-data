Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is `1`, `d` is `n // 2`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**

Explanation: The code `d -= (d + 1) // 2` updates the value of `d`. Given that `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`, when `d` is updated, `s` becomes `1`. The value of `d` is now `n // 2` because `d -= (d + 1) // 2` effectively sets `d` to half of its original value rounded down. All other variables remain unchanged.
