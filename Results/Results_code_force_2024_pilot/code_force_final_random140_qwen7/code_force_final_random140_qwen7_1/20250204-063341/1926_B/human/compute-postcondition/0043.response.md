Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is not explicitly initialized in the given state, but it will be set to 0 when the loop starts.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop `for j in range(n)` to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`). 

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state and will be set to 0 initially, no adjustment is needed for `j`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string**
