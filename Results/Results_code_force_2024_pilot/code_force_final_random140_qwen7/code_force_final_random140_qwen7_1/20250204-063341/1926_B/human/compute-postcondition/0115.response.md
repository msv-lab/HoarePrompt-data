Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 3, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square' depending on the last input string `s`, `s` is the final input string from the user, `j` is equal to `n` + 1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (which is `n` times), the variable `i` remains unchanged at 3, `t` remains at least 2, and `n` will be the input integer provided by the user. The variable `a` is set to 'Triangle' if any of the input strings `s` contained exactly one '1'. The variable `b` will be 'Square' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1'. The variable `s` will hold the value of the last input string, and `j` will be equal to `n` + 1 because `j` increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
