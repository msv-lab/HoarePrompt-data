Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    s = input()
    if s.count('1') == 1:
        a = 'Triangle'
    elif s.count('1') > 1:
        b = 'Square'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', `s` is an input string, and the count of '1' in `s` is either exactly 1 or greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `s` is the input string received from the user. If `s.count('1') == 1`, then `a` is set to 'Triangle'. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `s` is the string input by the user, and if the string `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle'. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
