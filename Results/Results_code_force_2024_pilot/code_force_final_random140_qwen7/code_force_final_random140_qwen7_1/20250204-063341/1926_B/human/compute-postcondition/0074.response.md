Output: **Triangle**

Explanation: According to the initial state, the variable `a` is explicitly set to the string 'Triangle'. The value of `s` is a string input by the user, and it is mentioned that `a` is set to 'Triangle' because `s` contains exactly one '1'. Since this condition is satisfied, `a` remains 'Triangle'. Therefore, when the `print(a)` statement is executed, it will print 'Triangle'.
