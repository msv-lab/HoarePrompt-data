Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is equal to `j + 1`, where `j` is the total number of times the loop ran.
- `i` remains 1 as it was not affected by the loop.
- `a` is 'Square' if all input strings had more than one '1', and 'Triangle' otherwise.
- `b` is 'Square' if all input strings had more than one '1', and an empty string otherwise.

Given these conditions, let's determine what `b` will be:

- If all input strings had more than one '1', then `b` would be 'Square'.
- If any input string had exactly one '1', then `b` would be an empty string.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact input strings, we cannot definitively determine the value of `b`. However, based on the conditions provided, `b` will either be 'Square' or an empty string.

Output: **'Square' or '' (where 'Square' is printed if all input strings had more than one '1', and an empty string otherwise)**
