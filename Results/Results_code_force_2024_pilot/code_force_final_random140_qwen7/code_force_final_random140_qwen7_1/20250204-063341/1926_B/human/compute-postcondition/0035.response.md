Postcondition: **`n` will be equal to the total number of times the loop ran, which is `j + 1`. The variable `i` will still be 1 as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `a` will be 'Square' if all input strings had more than one '1', and will remain 'Triangle' if none of the input strings had exactly one '1'. The variable `b` will be 'Square' if all input strings had more than one '1', and will remain an empty string if no such string was entered.**
