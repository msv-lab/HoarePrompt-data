Postcondition: `i` is 3, `t` is at least 2, `n` is at least 1, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `s` is the string input by the user, `j` is 4. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', the conditions on `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.
