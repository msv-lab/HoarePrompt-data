Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is equal to `j + 1`, where `j` is the total number of times the loop ran.
- `i` remains 1 because it was not affected by the loop.
- `a` is set to 'Triangle' if any of the input strings had exactly one '1', and 'Square' if all input strings had more than one '1'.
- `b` is 'Square' if any of the input strings had more than one '1', and remains an empty string if no such string was entered.
- The condition `a != 0` is satisfied, meaning `a` is either 'Triangle' or 'Square'.

Given these conditions, the value of `a` is determined by the presence of strings with exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. Since `a` is not zero, it means `a` must be either 'Triangle' or 'Square'. Without additional information about the specific input strings, we cannot determine precisely whether `a` is 'Triangle' or 'Square', but we know it is one of these two values.

Output: **a (where a is either 'Triangle' or 'Square')**
