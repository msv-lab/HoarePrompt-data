Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` in the range of `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.
   - `a` is 'Triangle' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, otherwise `a` is 'Square'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range of `n`. This means `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` will be `n - 1 - 1 = n - 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `s` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `a` remains unchanged because it depends on the count of '1' in `s`, which does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `s` is an input string, `j` is `n - 2`, and `a` is 'Triangle' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, otherwise `a` is 'Square'.**
