State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
3. The variable `i` starts at 0 in the first iteration of the loop, so it needs to be set to 1 to match the initial state of `i` in the loop.
4. Since `t` is given as an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `t` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1.
