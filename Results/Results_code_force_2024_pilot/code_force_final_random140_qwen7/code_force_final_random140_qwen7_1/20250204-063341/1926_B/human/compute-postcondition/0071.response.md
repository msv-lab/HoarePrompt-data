Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `s` is the string input by the user, and if any of the strings `s` contain exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` remains 0 and `b` remains 'Square'.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will still be 2, `t` will still be at least 2, and `n` will be the original input integer which must be at least 3. The variable `a` will be 'Triangle' if any of the input strings `s` had exactly one '1', otherwise it will remain 0. The variable `b` will be 'Square' regardless of the inputs, as long as at least one string with more than one '1' was entered. The variable `s` will hold the last input string provided by the user during the loop's execution.
