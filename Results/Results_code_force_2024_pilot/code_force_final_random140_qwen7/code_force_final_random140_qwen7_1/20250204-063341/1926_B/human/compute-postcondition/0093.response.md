Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', `s` is the string input by the user, and `s` contains more than one '1'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'Square'` to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
