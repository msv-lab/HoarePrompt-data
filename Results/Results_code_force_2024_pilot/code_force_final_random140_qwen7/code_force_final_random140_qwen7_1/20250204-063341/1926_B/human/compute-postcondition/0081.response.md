Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `s` is the string input by the user**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `s`) remain unchanged with their initial or specified conditions.
