Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `t` must be at least 2
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `a` is 'Triangle'
   - `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'
   - `s` is the string input by the user
   - `j` is 4

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute again**:
   - The loop will execute again if `j < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 4 and `n` must be at least 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body increments `j` by 1).
   - Therefore, `j` will become 5.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` remains 3
   - `t` must still be at least 2
   - `n` remains at least 1
   - `a` remains 'Triangle'
   - `b` remains either an empty string or 'Square'
   - `s` remains the string input by the user
   - `j` becomes 5

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 3, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', `s` is the string input by the user, `j` is 5**
