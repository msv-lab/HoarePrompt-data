Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented as a list of n strings. Each string contains n characters which are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid. The function returns whether the shape formed by '1's is a triangle or a square.**

This means the function takes a grid (a list of strings) as its input, where each string represents a row in the grid, and each character in the string is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one shape (either a triangle or a square) made up entirely of '1's. The function then determines whether the shape is a triangle or a square and returns the result accordingly.
