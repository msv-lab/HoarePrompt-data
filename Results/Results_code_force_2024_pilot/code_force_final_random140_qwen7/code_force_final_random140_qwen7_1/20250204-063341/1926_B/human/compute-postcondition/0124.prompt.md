Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The grid and n remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'Triangle'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'Square'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` will be equal to the total number of times the loop ran, which is `j + 1`. The variable `i` will still be 1 as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `a` will be 'Triangle' if any of the input strings had exactly one '1', and 'Square' if all input strings had more than one '1'. The variable `b` will be 'Square' if any of the input strings had more than one '1', and will remain an empty string if no such string was entered.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `s` is the string input by the user, and `a` is set to 'Triangle' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` remains 0 and `b` remains 'Square'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square' depending on the last input string `s`, `s` is the final input string from the user, `j` is equal to `n` + 1, and `a` is not 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
