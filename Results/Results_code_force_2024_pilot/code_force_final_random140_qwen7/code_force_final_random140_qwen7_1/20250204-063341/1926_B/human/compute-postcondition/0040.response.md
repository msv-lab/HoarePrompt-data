Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `i` retains its initial value of 2, and the condition for `t` remains unchanged (must be at least 2). The code `n = int(input())` assigns an integer value obtained from user input to the variable `n`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` as an input integer, while `i` and `t` retain their initial conditions.
