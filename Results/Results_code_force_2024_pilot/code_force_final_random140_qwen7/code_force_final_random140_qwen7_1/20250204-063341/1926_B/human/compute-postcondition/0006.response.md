Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `s` is an input string**

The code assigns the value of the input string to the variable `s`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both the updated variable `s` and the unchanged precondition for `n`.
