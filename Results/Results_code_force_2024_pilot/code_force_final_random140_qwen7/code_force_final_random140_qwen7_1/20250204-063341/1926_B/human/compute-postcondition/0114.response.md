Postcondition: `i` is 3, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square' depending on whether `s` contains more than one '1', `s` is the new input string from the user, `j` is 5. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `b` remains unchanged. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is changed to 'Square'.
