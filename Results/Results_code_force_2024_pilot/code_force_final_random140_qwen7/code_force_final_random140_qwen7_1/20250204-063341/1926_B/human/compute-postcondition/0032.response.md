Postcondition: `n` will be equal to the total number of times the loop ran, which is `j + 1`. The variable `i` will still be 1 as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `a` will be 'Triangle' if any of the input strings had exactly one '1', and 'Square' if all input strings had more than one '1'. The variable `b` will be 'Square' if any of the input strings had more than one '1', and will remain an empty string if no such string was entered. Additionally, the condition `a != 0` is satisfied.
