Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square. The logic in the function is flawed because it only checks if any row contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1', without considering the overall pattern of the grid. This approach will not accurately determine if the shape is a triangle or a square based on the given criteria.
