Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape formed by '1's in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Rows with Single '1'**: The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1' and immediately assumes it's a triangle. This is incorrect because a square can also have rows with exactly one '1' if those '1's are positioned symmetrically around the center of the grid.

2. **Lack of Proper Triangle Detection**: The program does not properly check for the pattern of '1's required to form a triangle. Specifically, it should verify that the '1's in the rows follow the pattern of a triangle (i.e., the number of '1's increases by 2 for each subsequent row until the middle row, and then decreases symmetrically).

3. **Incorrect Assumption for Square**: The program assumes that if no row has exactly one '1', then the shape must be a square. However, this is also incorrect because there could be other configurations that do not fit either a triangle or a square but still contain '1's.

Given these issues, the program will not correctly identify the shapes in the provided test cases.

Correctness: **False**
