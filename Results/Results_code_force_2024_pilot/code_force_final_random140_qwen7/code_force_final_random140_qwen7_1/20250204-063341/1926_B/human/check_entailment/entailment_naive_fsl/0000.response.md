Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify either triangles or squares in the grid. Let's analyze why:

1. **Triangle Detection**: The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to determine a triangle. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   000
   010
   011
   ```
   This grid contains a triangle, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because no row has exactly one '1'.

2. **Square Detection**: The program checks if any row contains more than one '1'. If so, it assumes a square. However, this is also insufficient. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   000
   011
   011
   ```
   This grid contains a triangle, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because the second and third rows both have two '1's.

To correctly identify the shapes, the program needs to check for the specific patterns of a triangle and a square. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how the correct solution might look:

1. **Triangle Check**: Check if there exists a central column with '1's forming a triangle pattern.
2. **Square Check**: Check if there exists a central column with '1's forming a square pattern.

Given these points, the provided program does not handle the necessary checks for both shapes correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
