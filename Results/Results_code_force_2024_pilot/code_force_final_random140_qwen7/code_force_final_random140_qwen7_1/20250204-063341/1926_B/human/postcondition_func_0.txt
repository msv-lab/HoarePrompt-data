The function processes a series of grids, each represented as a list of n strings containing '0's and '1's. It determines whether the shape formed by '1's in each grid is a triangle or a square. If any row in the grid contains exactly one '1', it prints 'Triangle'. Otherwise, it prints 'Square'. The function runs this check for each of the t test cases provided. After processing all test cases, it outputs the determined shape for each grid.
