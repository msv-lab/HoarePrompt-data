Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Non-Decreasing Order:**
   - The initial check `check_all = all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` checks if the array is already non-decreasing. This is not what we need. We need to check if the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting and Swapping:**
   - The code attempts to find a split point `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]` and then checks if the subarray starting from `i` can be placed at the beginning and the rest of the array can follow without violating the non-decreasing order.
   - However, the logic for checking `check_all` and `new_all` is flawed. It does not properly validate the entire condition required to make the array non-decreasing after the swap.

3. **Break Statements:**
   - The use of `break` statements in the loop can lead to premature termination of the loop, which may result in incorrect outputs.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we should:
1. Identify the first position `i` where the sequence breaks the non-decreasing order.
2. Check if the remaining part of the array is non-decreasing.
3. Check if the prefix (from the start to `i`) can be placed after the suffix (from `i` to the end) to form a non-decreasing array.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the first position where the array breaks non-decreasing order
        i = 0
        while i < n - 1 and a[i] <= a[i + 1]:
            i += 1
        
        # If the array is already non-decreasing
        if i == n - 1:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Check if the remaining part of the array is non-decreasing
        if all(a[j] <= a[j + 1] for j in range(i + 1, n - 1)):
            # Check if the prefix can be placed after the suffix to form a non-decreasing array
            if a[0] <= a[n - 1]:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This approach ensures that the conditions for making the array non-decreasing are correctly checked.
