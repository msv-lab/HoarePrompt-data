Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the array itself.
3. It first checks if the array `a` is already strictly increasing using `check_all = all([(a[i - 1] < a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])`. If it is, it prints 'YES'.
4. If the array is not strictly increasing, it enters a loop where it tries to split the array at different positions to see if the left part is strictly increasing and the right part, when reversed, is also strictly increasing.
5. The logic inside the loop correctly checks if the left part is strictly increasing (`check_all`) and if the right part, when reversed, is also strictly increasing (`new_all`).
6. If both conditions are met for any split, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
7. If no valid split is found, it prints 'NO'.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function appears to implement the required logic accurately. Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
