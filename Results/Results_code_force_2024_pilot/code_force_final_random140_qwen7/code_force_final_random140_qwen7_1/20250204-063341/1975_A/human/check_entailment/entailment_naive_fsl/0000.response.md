Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
4
1 3 2 4
```

The array `[1, 3, 2, 4]` cannot be made non-decreasing by any number of splits and swaps according to the problem description. However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" for this case. This is because the program checks if the entire array is already non-decreasing (`check_all = all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`) and then only performs additional checks if this condition fails. For the given array, the first check fails, but the subsequent checks do not correctly determine that no valid split and swap can make the array non-decreasing. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
