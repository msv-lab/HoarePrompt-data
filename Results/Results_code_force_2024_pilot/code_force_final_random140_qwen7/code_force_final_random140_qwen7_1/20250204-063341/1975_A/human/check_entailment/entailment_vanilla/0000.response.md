Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.
   
2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

3. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - If the array is not already sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position where the sequence breaks (`a[i - 1] > a[i]`).
   - It then splits the array at this position and checks if the right part can be placed before the left part such that the entire array becomes non-decreasing.

4. **Detailed Checks:**
   - The program checks if the left part of the split is greater than the right part for all elements (`check_all = all([a[0] > new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`).
   - It also checks if the right part itself is non-decreasing (`new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`).

5. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initial Check:**
   - This part correctly identifies if the array is already sorted, which is a valid base case.

2. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - The logic for splitting the array and checking the conditions is sound. It ensures that the right part can be placed before the left part without violating the non-decreasing order.
   - The nested loop and conditions ensure that the program correctly identifies whether the array can be made non-decreasing by the described operation.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like the array being empty or having only one element, which are not explicitly mentioned but are implicitly handled by the initial check.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by the described operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
