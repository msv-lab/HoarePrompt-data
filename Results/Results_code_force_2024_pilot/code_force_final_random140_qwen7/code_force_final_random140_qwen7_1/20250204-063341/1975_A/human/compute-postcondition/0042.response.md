Based on the initial state provided:

- `new_all` is a boolean value that checks if all elements in `new[1:]` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a[2:]` are less than or equal to the previous element.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the same as before (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement).

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the other variables, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
