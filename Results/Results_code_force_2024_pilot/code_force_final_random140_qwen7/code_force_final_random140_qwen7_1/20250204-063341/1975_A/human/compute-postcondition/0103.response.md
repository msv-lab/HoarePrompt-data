Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`.
   - This means `i` will take values from 1 to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given state, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - The loop starts with `i` taking the value 1.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(1, n)` to execute, `i` must start from 1 and go up to `n-1`.
   - Given that `i` is initially equal to `n`, the loop cannot start because `i` is already out of the range specified in the loop head (`1` to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - To allow the loop to execute, `i` must be set to 1 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` should remain as an input integer but does not need to be adjusted since it is used in the loop condition.

5. **List the adjusted states**:
   - `i` must be 1.
   - `n` remains as an input integer.
   - Other variables like `a`, `new_all`, `t`, `check_all`, and `new` do not need adjustment as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer**.
