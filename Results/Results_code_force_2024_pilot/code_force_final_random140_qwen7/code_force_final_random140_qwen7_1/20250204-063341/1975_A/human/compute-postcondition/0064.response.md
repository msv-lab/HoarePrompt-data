Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `a` is a list of integers starting from index 3 to the end of the original list `a`.
- `new_all` is True.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- The current value of `a[2]` is greater than `a[3]`.
- `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`.
- The if condition `(check_all and new_all)` is true.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' without any conditions or additional variables being evaluated.

Output: **YES**
