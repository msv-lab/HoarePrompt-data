Postcondition: `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a[2:]` are less than or equal to the previous element, and `new_all` is the result of checking if all elements in `a[2:]` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`, `i` is 2. In either case (whether the condition `a[i-1] > a[i]` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
