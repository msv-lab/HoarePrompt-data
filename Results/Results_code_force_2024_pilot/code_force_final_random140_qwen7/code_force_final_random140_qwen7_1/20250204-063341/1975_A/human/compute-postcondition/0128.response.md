Postcondition: `i` is 2, `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`. If the element at index `i-1` in `a` is greater than the element at index `i`, then `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are less than or equal to the next one. If the condition `check_all and new_all` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, if the condition is not met, the same conditions for `check_all` and `new_all` apply without breaking out of the loop or if statement.
