Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `new` is a slice from index `n-1` to the end of the list `a`. `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`. `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are less than or equal to the next one. The loop will continue to iterate as long as `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is true for some `i`. If the condition is never met throughout the loop, the loop will finish without printing 'YES' or 'NO'.
