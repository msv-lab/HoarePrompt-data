Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `check_all` is True if all elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than the next element, `i` is 3, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `new_all` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers starting from index 3 to the end of the original list `a`, `new_all` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0, and `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i])` for each `i` in the range of length of `new`. If `a[2]` is greater than `a[3]`, `check_all` is set to False. Otherwise, `check_all` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers starting from index 4 to the end of the original list `a`, `new_all` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0, `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i])` for each `i` in the range of length of `new`. If `a[2]` is greater than `a[3]`, `check_all` is set to False. Otherwise, `check_all` remains unchanged. `new` is now a slice of `a` starting from index 4 (which is `i`) to the end. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers starting from index 5 to the end of the original list `a`, `new_all` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0, `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`, and if `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` is set to False. Otherwise, `check_all` remains unchanged. `new` is now a slice of `a` starting from index 5 (which is `i`) to the end, and regardless of whether the `if` condition is true or false, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
