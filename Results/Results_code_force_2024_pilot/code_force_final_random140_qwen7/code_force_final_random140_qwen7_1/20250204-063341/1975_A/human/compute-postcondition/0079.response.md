Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 3, but its exact value is not needed for the current print statement.
   - `a` is a list of integers starting from index 4 to the end of the original list `a`. This means `a[4:]` contains the elements from index 4 onwards.
   - `new_all` is True, but this is not relevant to the current print statement.
   - `t` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed for the current print statement.
   - `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`. Here, `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index `i` (which is 4) to the end. So, `new` is `a[4:]`.

2. **Condition for `check_all`:**
   - `check_all` is set to `False` if `a[2]` is greater than `a[3]`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
   - Since `a[2]` and `a[3]` are elements of the original list `a` and `a[2]` is the third element and `a[3]` is the fourth element, the value of `check_all` depends on the comparison between these two elements.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given the print statement, the output will be the string `'NO'` regardless of the value of `check_all`.

Output: **'NO'**
