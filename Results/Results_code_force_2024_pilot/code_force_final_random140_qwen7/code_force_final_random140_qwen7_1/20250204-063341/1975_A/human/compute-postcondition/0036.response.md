Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a[2:]` are less than or equal to the previous element.
   - `new_all` is the result of checking if all elements in `a[2:]` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`.
   - `i` is currently 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The variable `i` will be 3.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged.
   - The postconditions related to `check_all` and `new_all` remain the same as they are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a[2:]` are less than or equal to the previous element, `new_all` is the result of checking if all elements in `a[2:]` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`, `i` is 3, `n` is the same as before.**
