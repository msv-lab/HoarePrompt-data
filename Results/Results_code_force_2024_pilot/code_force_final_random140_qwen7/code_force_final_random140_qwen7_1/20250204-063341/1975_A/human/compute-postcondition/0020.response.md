Postcondition: `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the previous element, and `new_all` is False if either `check_all` is False or the break statement was executed during the loop. Otherwise, `new_all` is the result of checking if all elements in `new` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`.
