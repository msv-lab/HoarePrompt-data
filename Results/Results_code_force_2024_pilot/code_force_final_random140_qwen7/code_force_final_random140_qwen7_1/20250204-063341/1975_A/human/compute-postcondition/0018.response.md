Based on the initial state provided:

- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the previous element.
- `new_all` is the result of checking if all elements in `new` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`.
- Either `check_all` is False or `new_all` is False.

This means that at least one of these conditions is false, implying that the sequence in `new` does not satisfy the condition where each element is less than or equal to the previous one.

Given this information, the print statement `print('NO')` will simply output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
