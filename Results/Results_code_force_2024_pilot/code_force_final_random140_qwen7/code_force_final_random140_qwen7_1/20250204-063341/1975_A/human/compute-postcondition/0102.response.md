Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers with the first element being the input integer `n` followed by other integers.
- `new_all` remains unchanged (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index `n-1` (which is `i`) to the end.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
