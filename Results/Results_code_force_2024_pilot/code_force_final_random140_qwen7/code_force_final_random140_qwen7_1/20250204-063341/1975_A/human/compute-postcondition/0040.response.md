Based on the initial state provided:

- `new_all` is a boolean value that checks if all elements in `new[1:]` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`. However, the value of `new_all` itself is not explicitly mentioned.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a[2:]` are less than or equal to the previous element. Again, the value of `check_all` is not explicitly mentioned.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the same as before, but its value is not specified.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
