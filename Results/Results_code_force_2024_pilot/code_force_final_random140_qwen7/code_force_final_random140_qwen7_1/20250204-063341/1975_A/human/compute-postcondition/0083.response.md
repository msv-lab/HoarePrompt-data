Postcondition: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers starting from index 4 to the end of the original list `a`, `new_all` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0, `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i])` for each `i` in the range of length of `new`. If `a[2]` is greater than `a[3]`, `check_all` is set to False. Otherwise, `check_all` remains unchanged. `new` is now a slice of `a` starting from index 4 (which is `i`) to the end. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
