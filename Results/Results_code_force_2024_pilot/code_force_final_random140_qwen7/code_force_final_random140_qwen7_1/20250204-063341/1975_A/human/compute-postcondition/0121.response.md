Output State: **`i` is 2; `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `check_all` to the result of a list comprehension that checks if each element in `new` (a slice from index 2 to the end of `a`) is less than the corresponding element in `a` at index 0. Since no specific values for `a` are given, `check_all` remains a boolean value based on the comparison. Variables `i` and `new` retain their initial states.
