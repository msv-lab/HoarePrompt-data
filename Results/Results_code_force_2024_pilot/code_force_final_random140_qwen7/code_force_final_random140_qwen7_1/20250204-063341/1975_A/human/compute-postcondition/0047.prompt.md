Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the previous element. `new_all` is False if either `check_all` is False or the break statement was executed during the loop. Otherwise, `new_all` remains the result of checking if all elements in `new` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a[2:]` are less than or equal to the previous element, and `new_all` is the result of checking if all elements in `a[2:]` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`, `i` is 2. In either case (whether the condition `a[i-1] > a[i]` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `check_all` remains unchanged, `new_all` remains unchanged, `i` becomes 0, and `n` remains the same as before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
