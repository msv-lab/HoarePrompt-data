Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`. This means the loop starts with `i = 1` and continues until `i < n`.

2. **Postcondition**: The postcondition involves two variables:
   - `check_all`: A boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the previous element.
   - `new_all`: A boolean indicating whether `check_all` is True and no `break` statement was executed during the loop.

3. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it ranges from `1` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjusting States**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop continues, `i` will become `2`.

5. **Conditions for Loop Continuation**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

6. **States to Adjust**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i`.

**Answer**:
State: **`check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the previous element, `new_all` is False if either `check_all` is False or the break statement was executed during the loop, otherwise `new_all` remains the result of checking if all elements in `new` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`, `i` is 2**
