Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - The element at index 0 in list `a` is greater than the element at index 1 in list `a`.
   - `new` is a sublist starting from index 1 to the end of list `a`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of whether `check_all` and `new_all` are true or false.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `n` must remain the same (since `n` is an input integer and does not change within the loop).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The other states (`a`, `new`, `check_all`, `new_all`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer**
