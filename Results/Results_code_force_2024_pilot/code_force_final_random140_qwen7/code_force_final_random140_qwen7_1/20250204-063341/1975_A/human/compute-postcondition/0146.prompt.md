You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n positive integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] < a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        
    #State: All variables outside the loop remain unchanged. Specifically, `t` retains its initial value, `n` and `a` retain their final values after the last iteration of the loop. `check_all` and `new_all` are determined based on the final state of the list `a` and the value of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. Additionally, it accepts an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, which represents the number of test cases. The function returns a result based on the conditions provided for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
