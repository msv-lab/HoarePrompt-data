Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not relevant to the output of the print statement.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. The key detail here is that `check_all` is True, which means that all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order starting from the first element.
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of `n` and `a`.

Therefore, the output will be **YES**.
