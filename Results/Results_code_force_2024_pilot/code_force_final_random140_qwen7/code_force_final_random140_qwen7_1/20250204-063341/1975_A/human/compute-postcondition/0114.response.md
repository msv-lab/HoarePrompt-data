Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is an input integer (though its specific value is not needed to determine the output).
- The element at index 0 in list `a` is greater than the element at index 1 in list `a`.
- `new` is a sublist starting from index 1 to the end of list `a`.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether not all elements in `new` are less than the element at index 0 in list `a`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether not all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
