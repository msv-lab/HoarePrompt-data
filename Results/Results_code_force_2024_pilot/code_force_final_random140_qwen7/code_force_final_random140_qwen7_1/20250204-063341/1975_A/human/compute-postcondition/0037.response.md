Output State: **`check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a[2:]` are less than or equal to the previous element, `new_all` is the result of checking if all elements in `a[2:]` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`, `i` is now 0, `n` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list. Given that `i` is 3, `new` will contain elements from index 3 onwards of list `a`. The values of `check_all` and `new_all` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this assignment. The value of `i` is updated to 0 due to the slicing operation.
