Output State: **`check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the previous element, and `new_all` is False since the break statement was executed.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. In this case, it indicates that the loop checking the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for all elements in `new` has been exited before completing the iteration. Since the loop was broken, the value of `new_all` is set to `False`. The value of `check_all` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
