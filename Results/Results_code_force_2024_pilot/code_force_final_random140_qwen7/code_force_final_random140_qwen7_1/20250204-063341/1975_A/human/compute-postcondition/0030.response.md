Based on the initial state provided:

- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a[2:]` are less than or equal to the previous element.
- `new_all` is the result of checking if all elements in `a[2:]` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `new` is now `a[2:]`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
