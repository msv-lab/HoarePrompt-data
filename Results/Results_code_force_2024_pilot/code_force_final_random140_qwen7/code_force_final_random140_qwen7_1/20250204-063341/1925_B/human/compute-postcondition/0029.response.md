Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the list [1, 2, x // 2], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the values [ans, 4, x // 4] if `x // 4` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` remains [ans, 4].**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(l)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` contains `[ans, 4, x // 4]` if `x // 4` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it remains `[ans, 4]`. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
