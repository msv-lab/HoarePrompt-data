Output State: **`ans` will be the maximum value found among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `int(x) / n`, `i` will be the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `int(x) / n`, and the input value will be one less than what it was at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous state. Additionally, the input value is updated to be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
