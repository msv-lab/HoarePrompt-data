Postcondition: `ans` is 3, `i` is 3, `l` is [2, 3, 1], and `x` must be divisible by 3. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to 3, `i` remains 3, and `l` is updated to [2, 3, 1]. Since there is no else part, these changes apply regardless of whether the condition `x % i == 0` is true or false.
