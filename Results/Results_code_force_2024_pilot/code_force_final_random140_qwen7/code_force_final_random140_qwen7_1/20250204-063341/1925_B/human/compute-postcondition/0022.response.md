Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the list [1, 2, x // 2], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The line `l = [ans]` creates a new list `l` that contains only the value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
