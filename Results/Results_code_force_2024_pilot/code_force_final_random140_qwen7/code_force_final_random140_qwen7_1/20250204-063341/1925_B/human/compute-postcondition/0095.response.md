Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` will be the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `int(x) / n`, and `k` is `x // n`.**

Explanation: The code sets `ans` to 1. This does not affect the values of `i` or `k`, which remain as initially defined. Therefore, `ans` is now 1, while `i` and `k` retain their original definitions based on the initial state.
