Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is either 2 or remains 1, `l` is [1, 1], and `ans` is set to the maximum value of the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = max(l)` sets `ans` to the maximum value in the list `l`. Given that `l` is `[1, 1]`, the maximum value is `1`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `1`. The values of `i` and the list `l` remain unchanged from the initial state.
