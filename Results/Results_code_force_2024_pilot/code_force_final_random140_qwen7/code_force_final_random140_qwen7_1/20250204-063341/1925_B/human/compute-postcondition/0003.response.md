Output State: **`ans` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is the first integer entered by the user, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, and `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. No other changes are made to the variables `t`, `x`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
