Output State: **`ans` will be the maximum value found among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` remains the same as the initial input, `n` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, and `i` is the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `int(x) / n`.**

Explanation: The code `k = x // n` calculates the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n` and assigns it to `k`. The other variables (`ans`, `t`, `x`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
