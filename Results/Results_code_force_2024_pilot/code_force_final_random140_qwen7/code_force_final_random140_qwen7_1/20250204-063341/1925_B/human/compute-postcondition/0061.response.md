Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to int(x) and `x % i` equals 0; `l` is a list containing the elements `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`; the current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Since `l` initially contains the element `ans` and possibly `i`, after appending `x // i`, `l` now contains `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
