Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the list [1, 2, x // 2], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the values [ans, 4]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `l` now contains both the value of `ans` and the value of `i`.
