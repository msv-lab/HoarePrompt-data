Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `ans` is set to the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, and `l` is a list containing the element `ans`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l = [ans]` replaces the existing list `l` with a new list containing only the element `ans`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `i_prev + 1` remain unchanged from their previous states. The list `l` now contains only one element, which is `ans`. The value of `x // (i_prev + 1)` is no longer part of the list since the list was truncated to contain only `ans`.
