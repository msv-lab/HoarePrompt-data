Output State: **`ans` is 2, `i` is 2, `l` is [1, 2, 1]**.

Explanation: The code `ans = max(l)` assigns the maximum value of the list `l` to `ans`. Given that `l` is `[1, 2, 1]`, the maximum value is `2`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `2`. The values of `i` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
