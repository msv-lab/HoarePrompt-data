Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `l` is [1, 2, 1], `k` is undefined**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `x` is not specified, but since no value for `x` is given, we assume `x` is not defined or its value is irrelevant for this context. However, based on the structure of the problem, it seems `x` should be a value that when divided by `i` (which is 2) gives an integer. Without loss of generality, let's assume `x` is such that `x // i` results in 1 (as per typical problem constraints). Thus, `l` becomes `[1, 2, 1]`. The variable `k` is not mentioned in the initial state and is not affected by the code, so it remains undefined.
