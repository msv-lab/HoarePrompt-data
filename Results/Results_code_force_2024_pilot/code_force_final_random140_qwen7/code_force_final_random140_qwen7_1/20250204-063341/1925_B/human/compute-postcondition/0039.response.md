Postcondition: `ans` is the maximum value in the list [1, 2, x // 2], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 5, `l` is `[ans, 5, x // 5]` if `x // 5` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `l` remains `[ans, 5]`.
