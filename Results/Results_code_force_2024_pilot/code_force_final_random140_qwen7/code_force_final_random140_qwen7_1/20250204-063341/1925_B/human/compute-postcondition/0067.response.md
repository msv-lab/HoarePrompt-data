Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the upper bound).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is within the range `1` to `int(x)`.
   - `ans` is set to the maximum value among `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`.
   - `l` is a list containing the elements `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`.
   - The current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Check the New Value of `i`**:
   - The new value of `i` should still be within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Also, the new value of `i` should still satisfy the conditions related to `k` and `x // i`.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `ans` might change based on the new value of `i` and `x // i`.
   - `l` will be updated with the new values of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `ans` will be updated to the maximum value among `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`.
- `l` will be updated to include the new values.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, let's denote it as `i_prev`. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `ans` is set to the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, and `l` is a list containing the elements `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`**.
