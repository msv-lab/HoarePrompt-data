Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the list [1, 2, x // 2], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 5, `l` is `[ans, 5, x // 5]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `x // i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 5, `x // i` is equivalent to `x // 5`. Since `i` is 5 and `x // i` is added to `l`, the list `l` now contains `ans`, 5, and `x // 5`. All other variables remain unchanged.
