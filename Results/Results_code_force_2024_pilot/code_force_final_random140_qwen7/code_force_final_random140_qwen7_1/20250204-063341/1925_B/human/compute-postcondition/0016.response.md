Postcondition: `ans` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 3, `l` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and the value of `x // 2`, if `x // i <= k`. Otherwise, `i` remains 2.
