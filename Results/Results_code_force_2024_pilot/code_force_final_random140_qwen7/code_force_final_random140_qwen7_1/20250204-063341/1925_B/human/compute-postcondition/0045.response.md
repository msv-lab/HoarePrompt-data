Based on the initial state described, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `x` is the initial input value.
- `n` is the second integer entered by the user.
- `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, i.e., `k = x // n`.
- `i` is the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` and also less than or equal to `k`.
- `ans` is the maximum value found among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`.

The print statement `print(ans)` will output the value of `ans`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Given the precondition, the exact value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `x` and `n`. However, we know that `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that meets the criteria mentioned.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to k)**
