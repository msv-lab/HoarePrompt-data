Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, and `l` is `[ans, i]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = max(l)` updates `ans` to be the maximum value among the elements in list `l`, which consists of `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`. The values of `i` and `l` remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition `if x // i <= k` is not relevant here because the code does not change `ans`, `i`, or `l` based on this condition; it only updates `ans` to ensure it is the maximum value among the specified elements.
