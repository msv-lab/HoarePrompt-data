Postcondition: `ans` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 1 and will go up to `int(x / n)`. The current value of `i` is 1 and the condition `x % i == 0` is true.
