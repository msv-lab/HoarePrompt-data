Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the maximum value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, where `k` is `x // n`. After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the condition `i <= k`. The variable `l` will contain the maximum value found during the loop, along with possibly the value of `i` itself, depending on whether it meets the criteria. 

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` will be the last such divisor checked. The list `l` will store the maximum value found during the loop.
