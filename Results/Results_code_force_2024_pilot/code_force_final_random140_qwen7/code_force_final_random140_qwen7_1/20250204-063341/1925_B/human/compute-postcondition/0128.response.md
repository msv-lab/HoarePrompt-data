Output State: **`ans` is 2, `i` is 3, `l` is [2, 3, 1], `x` must be divisible by 3.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 3, `x` must be divisible by 3, so `x // i` will be `x / 3` (integer division). Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we know that `x // 3` will be an integer. Initially, `l` is `[2, 3]`, so after appending `x // 3`, `l` becomes `[2, 3, 1]` assuming `x` is 3 (the simplest case where `x // 3` equals 1). The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged.
