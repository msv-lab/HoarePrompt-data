Output State: **`ans` will be the maximum value found among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `int(x) / n`, `i` will be the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `int(x) / n`, and `k` is `x // n`.**

Explanation: The code `k = x // n` calculates the integer division of `x` by `n` and assigns the result to `k`. The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `k` is `x // n`.
