Postcondition: `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, and `l` is `[ans, i]`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `i` is updated to `i_prev + 2` and `ans` is updated to the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, with `l` being updated to `[ans, i]`. If `i` is greater than `k`, no changes are made to `ans`, `i`, or `l`.
