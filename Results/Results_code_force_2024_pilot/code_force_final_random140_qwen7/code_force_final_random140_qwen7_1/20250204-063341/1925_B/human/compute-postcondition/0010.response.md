Output State: **`ans` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 2, and `i` is less than or equal to `k**.

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1 initially) to the list `l`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The list `l` now contains the values 1 and 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
