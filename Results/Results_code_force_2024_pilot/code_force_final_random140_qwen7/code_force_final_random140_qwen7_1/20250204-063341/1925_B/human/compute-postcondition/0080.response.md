Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, `l` is `[ans, i]`**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` is `[ans]`. After executing `l.append(i)`, the list `l` becomes `[ans, i]`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
