Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is the first integer entered by the user, and `n` is the second integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user, splits them based on whitespace, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `x` and `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
