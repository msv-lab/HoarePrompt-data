You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = x // n
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the maximum value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, where `k` is `x // n`. After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the condition `i <= k`. The variable `l` will contain the maximum value found during the loop, along with possibly the value of `i` itself, depending on whether it meets the criteria. 
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` will be the last such divisor checked. The list `l` will store the maximum value found during the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which gives the minimum possible difficulty per sub-problem if the difficulties were evenly distributed.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which will store the maximum GCD found.

3. **Loop Through Possible Divisors**:
   - The loop iterates through numbers from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` (inclusive).
   - For each number `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - It checks if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and adds it to `l` if true.
     - It also checks if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` and adds it to `l` if true.
     - It updates `ans` to be the maximum value in `l`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all divisors, it prints `ans`.

### Correctness Check

To ensure the program is correct, let's verify the logic:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The program aims to find the maximum GCD of `n` sub-problems whose sum is `x`.
   - The approach is to check all divisors of `x` and see if they can form `n` sub-problems with the required properties.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is prime and `n > 1`, the only possible GCD is 1 because no other divisor can divide `x` evenly into `n` parts.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, the GCD will be 1.
   - If `x` is divisible by `n`, the GCD can be higher, but the program correctly identifies the highest possible GCD by checking all divisors.

3. **Optimality**:
   - The program correctly identifies the highest possible GCD by considering all divisors of `x` and ensuring the sum of the sub-problems equals `x`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties. It considers all possible divisors and ensures the sum constraint is met.
