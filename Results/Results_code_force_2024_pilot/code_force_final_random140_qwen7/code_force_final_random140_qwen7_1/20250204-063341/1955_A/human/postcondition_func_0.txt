The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\)). For each test case, it calculates two values, \(s1 = n \times a\) and \(s2 = b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a\), and prints the minimum of these two values. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
