### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the example test cases to verify the correctness of the program.

1. **Input Processing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculating Costs:**
   - `s1 = n * a`: This represents the total cost if Maxim buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price `a`.
   - `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`: This represents the total cost if Maxim uses the promotion for as many pairs of yogurts as possible and buys the remaining yogurts individually. Here, `n // 2` gives the number of full pairs, and `n % 2` gives the number of remaining individual yogurts.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for each test case.

Now, let's validate this with the example test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `2 5 9`
- Calculations:
  - `s1 = 2 * 5 = 10`
  - `s2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 5 = 9 * 1 + 0 * 5 = 9`
- Output: `min(10, 9) = 9`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `3 5 9`
- Calculations:
  - `s1 = 3 * 5 = 15`
  - `s2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 5 = 9 * 1 + 1 * 5 = 9 + 5 = 14`
- Output: `min(15, 14) = 14`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `3 5 11`
- Calculations:
  - `s1 = 3 * 5 = 15`
  - `s2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 5 = 11 * 1 + 1 * 5 = 11 + 5 = 16`
- Output: `min(15, 16) = 15`

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `4 5 11`
- Calculations:
  - `s1 = 4 * 5 = 20`
  - `s2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 4 % 2 * 5 = 11 * 2 + 0 * 5 = 22`
- Output: `min(20, 22) = 20`

The program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case according to the given logic. The calculations match the expected outputs.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the given promotion rules.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
