Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the prices `a` and `b`. The program iterates over the number of test cases, reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, calculates the total cost using both the regular price and the promotion price, and then prints the minimum of the two calculated costs. This matches the problem description and examples provided.
