### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to validate the original assessment.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates two values:
     - \( s1 = n \times a \): This represents the total cost if Maxim buys all yogurts at the regular price.
     - \( s2 = b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a \): This represents the total cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The function prints the minimum of these two values.

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \( s1 \) and \( s2 \) as described in the function summary.
   - It then prints the minimum of \( s1 \) and \( s2 \).

3. **Validation of Scenarios**:
   - **First Test Case**: \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
     - \( s1 = 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
     - \( s2 = 9 \)
     - Minimum cost: \( \min(10, 9) = 9 \)
   - **Second Test Case**: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
     - \( s1 = 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
     - \( s2 = 9 + 5 = 14 \)
     - Minimum cost: \( \min(15, 14) = 14 \)
   - **Third Test Case**: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
     - \( s1 = 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
     - \( s2 = 11 + 5 = 16 \)
     - Minimum cost: \( \min(15, 16) = 15 \)
   - **Fourth Test Case**: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
     - \( s1 = 4 \times 5 = 20 \)
     - \( s2 = 2 \times 11 + 0 \times 5 = 22 \)
     - Minimum cost: \( \min(20, 22) = 20 \)

The program correctly implements the logic for all described scenarios. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided function summary.
