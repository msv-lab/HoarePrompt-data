You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        s1 = n * a
        s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a
        print(min(s1, s2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\)). For each test case, it calculates two values, \(s1 = n \times a\) and \(s2 = b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a\), and prints the minimum of these two values. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts.
   - There are two pricing options: 
     - Regular price: `a` burles per yogurt.
     - Promotion price: `b` burles for two yogurts.

2. **Calculating Costs:**
   - Without any promotion, the total cost would be `s1 = n * a`.
   - With the promotion, the cost would be `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. This formula accounts for:
     - Buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`b * (n // 2)`).
     - If there's an odd number of yogurts left over, buy the remaining one at the regular price (`n % 2 * a`).

3. **Comparing Costs:**
   - The minimum cost is determined by comparing `s1` and `s2`, and printing the smaller value.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The provided code handles all edge cases correctly:
     - If `n` is even, `s2` will cover all yogurts.
     - If `n` is odd, `s2` will cover `n-1` yogurts at the promotion price and the last one at the regular price.
     - If `b < 2*a`, it's always cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, which is handled by `s1`.

5. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - It prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
