You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        s1 = n * a
        s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a
        print(min(s1, s2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\)). For each test case, it calculates two values, \(s1 = n \times a\) and \(s2 = b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a\), and prints the minimum of these two values. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the given promotion rules. 

- For each test case, the program first calculates the total cost without using any promotion (`s1 = n * a`).
- It then calculates the total cost using the promotion for as many pairs of yogurts as possible (`s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`), which ensures that the remaining yogurts are bought individually if necessary.
- Finally, it prints the minimum of these two costs.

This approach handles all potential cases correctly. For instance:
- In the first test case (2 yogurts, regular price 5, promotion price 9), the minimum cost is 9.
- In the second test case (3 yogurts, regular price 5, promotion price 9), the minimum cost is 14 (buy one pair for 9 and one individual for 5).
- In the third test case (3 yogurts, regular price 5, promotion price 11), the minimum cost is 15 (buy one pair for 11 and one individual for 5).
- In the fourth test case (4 yogurts, regular price 5, promotion price 11), the minimum cost is 20 (buy two pairs for 22, but since we need to minimize, we can buy two pairs for 22 and adjust to 20).

Since the program correctly implements the logic for all described scenarios, it is correct.
