Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.
- It then calculates `s1`, which is the total cost if Maxim buys all yogurts at the regular price (`n * a`).
- It also calculates `s2`, which is the total cost if Maxim takes advantage of the promotion as much as possible. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, meaning he buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
- Finally, it prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for each test case, which gives the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.
- The logic for calculating `s2` ensures that Maxim maximizes the use of the promotion while minimizing the total cost.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and follows the requirements specified.

Correctness: **True**
