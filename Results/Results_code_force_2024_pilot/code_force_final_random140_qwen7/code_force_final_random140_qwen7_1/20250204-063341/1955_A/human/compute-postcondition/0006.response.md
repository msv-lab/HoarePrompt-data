Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `s1` is `n * a`, `s2` is `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. It does not affect the value of `t` or the expressions for `s1` and `s2`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer within the specified range, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the input values, `s1` is now calculated as `n * a`, and `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.
