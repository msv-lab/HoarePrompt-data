Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `s1` is the product of `n` and `a`, `s2` is `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`**.

This means that the value of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new variable `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. The value of `s1` remains the same as the product of `n` and `a`.
