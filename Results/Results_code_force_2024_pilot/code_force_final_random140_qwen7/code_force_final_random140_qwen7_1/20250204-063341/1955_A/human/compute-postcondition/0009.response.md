Given the initial state and the code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.
- `s1` is `n * a`.
- `s2` is updated to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.
- `s1` remains unchanged.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(min(s1, s2))`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate `s1`:**
   \[
   s1 = n \times a
   \]

2. **Calculate `s2`:**
   \[
   s2 = b \times \left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + n \% 2 \times a
   \]
   Here, `\(\frac{n}{2}\)` is the integer division of `n` by 2, and `n \% 2` is the remainder when `n` is divided by 2.

3. **Determine the minimum of `s1` and `s2`:**
   We need to compare `s1` and `s2` to find the smaller value.

Let's consider different cases for `n`:

- If `n` is even:
  \[
  s2 = b \times \left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + 0 \times a = b \times \left(\frac{n}{2}\right)
  \]
  Since `s1 = n * a` and `s2 = b * \(\frac{n}{2}\)`, we need to compare `n * a` and `b * \(\frac{n}{2}\)`.

- If `n` is odd:
  \[
  s2 = b \times \left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right) + 1 \times a = b \times \left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right) + a
  \]
  Again, we need to compare `n * a` and `b * \(\frac{n-1}{2}\) + a`.

In both cases, the exact values depend on the specific inputs for `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, the expression for `min(s1, s2)` will be one of these two forms:

- For even `n`: `min(n * a, b * \(\frac{n}{2}\))`
- For odd `n`: `min(n * a, b * \(\frac{n-1}{2}\) + a)`

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for the minimum. However, the expression for the minimum value will be evaluated based on the above conditions.

Output: **min(n * a, b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a)**
