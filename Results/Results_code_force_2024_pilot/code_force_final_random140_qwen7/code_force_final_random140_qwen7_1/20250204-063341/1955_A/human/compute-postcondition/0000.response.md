Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop condition depends on the input from `input()`, we need to ensure that the input is a valid number within the specified range.

Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that the input from `input()` matches this condition. Therefore, the state should reflect that the input will be a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- The input from `input()` must be an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input from `input()` must be an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
