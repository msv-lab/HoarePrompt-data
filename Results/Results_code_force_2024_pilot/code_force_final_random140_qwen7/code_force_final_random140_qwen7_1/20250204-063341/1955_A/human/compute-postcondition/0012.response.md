Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the new integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `s1` is `n * a`, `s2` is updated to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`**.

Explanation: The code updates `s1` to be the product of `n` and `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s2` are updated based on the input, but `t` remains unchanged as per the initial state. `s2` is updated according to the formula `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.
