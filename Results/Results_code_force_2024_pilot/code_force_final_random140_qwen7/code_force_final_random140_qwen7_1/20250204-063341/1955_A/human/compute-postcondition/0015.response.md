Output State: The loop will continue to execute for each test case provided by the value of `t`. For each test case, `t` test scenarios will be processed. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each of these `t` test cases, the following will hold true:

- `n` is the integer input for the current test case.
- `a` is the integer input for the current test case.
- `b` is the integer input for the current test case.
- `s1` is the product of `n` and `a` for the current test case.
- `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a` for the current test case.
- The final output for each test case is the minimum of `s1` and `s2`.

All other variables outside the loop remain unchanged from their initial state.
