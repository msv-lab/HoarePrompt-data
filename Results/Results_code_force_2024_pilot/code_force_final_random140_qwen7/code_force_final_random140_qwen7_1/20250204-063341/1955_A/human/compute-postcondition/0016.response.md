Output State: **t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the final integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `s1` is `n * a`, `s2` is `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will hold the value of the last integer input provided by the user, while `a` and `b` retain their values from the last set of inputs. The variables `s1` and `s2` will be updated based on the final values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since the loop processes each test case independently, the final values of `s1` and `s2` will reflect the computation performed using the last set of inputs.
