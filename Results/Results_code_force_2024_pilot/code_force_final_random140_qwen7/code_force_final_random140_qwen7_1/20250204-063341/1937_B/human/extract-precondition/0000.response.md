Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The first line of each test case contains a binary string of length n representing the first row of the grid, and the second line contains a binary string of length n representing the second row of the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
