Output State: **`work` is False, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `work` is set to `False`, which does not affect the values of `ans` or `i`. The initial state of `ans` is defined as the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. These conditions remain unchanged after executing the line `work = False`.
