Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is `a[0] + b[1]`, `work` is True**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` increments `ans` by the value of `b[i]`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing the line of code, `i` becomes 2. The value of `ans` is updated to `a[0] + b[1]` because `ans` was initially `a[0]` and now it is incremented by `b[1]`. The variable `work` remains unchanged and is still `True`.
