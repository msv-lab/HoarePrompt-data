Output State: **`i` is 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes `i` to 0. The values of the other variables (`_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
