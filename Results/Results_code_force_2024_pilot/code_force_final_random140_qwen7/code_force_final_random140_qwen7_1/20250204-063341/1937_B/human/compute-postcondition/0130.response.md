Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is `ans + b[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`. The variable `ans` is updated to be `ans + b[i - 1]`, meaning `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the element at index `i - 1` in the list `b`. The initial condition that `i` is less than `len(a)` is still valid, but since `a` is not referenced in the code, it remains unchanged.
