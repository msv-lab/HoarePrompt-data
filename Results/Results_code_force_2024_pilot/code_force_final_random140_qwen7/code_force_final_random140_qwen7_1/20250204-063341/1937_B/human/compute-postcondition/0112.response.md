Postcondition: `i`, `j`, `counter`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work` retain their values as follows: 
- `i` is either `len(a)` or 2,
- `j` is `len(a) - 2`,
- `counter` is 1 if `a[len(a) - 1]` is '0' and `b[len(a) - 2]` is '1'; otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged,
- `t` is incremented by 1,
- `n` is an input integer,
- `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace,
- `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace,
- `ans` is the string `a[i-1]` or `b[i]` appended to the original `ans`,
- `work` is `True` and the length of `a` is greater than 0.
