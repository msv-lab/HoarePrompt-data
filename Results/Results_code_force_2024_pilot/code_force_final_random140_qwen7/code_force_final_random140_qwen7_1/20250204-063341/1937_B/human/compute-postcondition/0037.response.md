Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is either `a[0] + a[1]` or `a[0] + b[1] + a[1]`, `work` is either `True` or remains as `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])`, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user and its length must be at least 3, `b` is the stripped input string from user**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was either 1 or 2, after incrementing, `i` will now be either 2 or 3. The values of `ans`, `work`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
