Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the loop's conditions, and `work` is False, assuming `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`**.

This postcondition indicates that if the character at position `j + 1` in string `a` is equal to the character at position `j` in string `b`, then the variables `j`, `counter`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work` will retain their values as specified in the if part, with `counter` incremented to 2. If the condition is not met, the variables remain unchanged from their initial states as described in the precondition.
