Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)` - 1, `ans` is `ans` plus `a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial state was `i` is less than `len(a)`, after incrementing `i`, the new condition is `i` is less than `len(a)` - 1. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. It is still equal to `ans` plus `a[i]` before the increment.
