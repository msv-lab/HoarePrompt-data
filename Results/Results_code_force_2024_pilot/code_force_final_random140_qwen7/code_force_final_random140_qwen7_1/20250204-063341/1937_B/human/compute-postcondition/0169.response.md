Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the loop's conditions, and `work` remains `False`. If `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'` is true, `counter` becomes 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.**
