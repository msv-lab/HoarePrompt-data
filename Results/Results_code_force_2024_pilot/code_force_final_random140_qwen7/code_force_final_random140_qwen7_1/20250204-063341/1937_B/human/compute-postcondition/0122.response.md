Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is `ans` plus `b[i]`**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `b[i]` to it. Since `i` is less than `len(a)`, the index `i` is valid for both `a` and `b`. The initial state tells us that `ans` was already `ans` plus `a[i]`, and now it is further updated by adding `b[i]`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is the sum of its previous value (which included `a[i]`) and `b[i]`. The condition `i` is less than `len(a)` remains true, and the value of `i` itself is not specified to change, so it stays the same.
