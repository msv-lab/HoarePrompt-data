Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is 1, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, and `work` is `True`. Additionally, `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `len(a)` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`**
