Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`**.

Explanation: The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` simply assigns the function `sys.stdin.readline` to the variable `input`. This does not change the value of `t` or provide any new information about the binary strings that will be read later. Therefore, the only change is that `input` is now a reference to the `sys.stdin.readline` function.
