Output State: **`j` is 2, counter is 1**

The value of `j` remains unchanged at 2. The variable `counter` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 0 (implied by the condition `len(a) > 1` which only matters for the existence of `a` and not the value of `counter` itself). Therefore, `counter` is now 1.
