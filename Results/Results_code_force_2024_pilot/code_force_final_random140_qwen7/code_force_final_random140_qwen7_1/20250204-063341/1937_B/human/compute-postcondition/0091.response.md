Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `len(a)` is greater than 1, `counter` is 1 if `a[len(a) - 1]` is '0' and `b[len(a) - 2]` is '1'. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` reads an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
