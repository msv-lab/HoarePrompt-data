Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `ans` is set to an empty string.
