Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is equal to `len(a) - 2`.
- `len(a)` is greater than 1.
- `counter` is 1 if `a[len(a) - 1]` is '0' and `b[len(a) - 2]` is '1'. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.

We need to determine the value of `counter`.

Given that `j = len(a) - 2`, it implies that the loop has completed all its iterations and the last iteration involved checking the conditions for `counter`.

For `counter` to be 1, both conditions must be true:
- `a[len(a) - 1]` must be '0'.
- `b[len(a) - 2]` must be '1'.

Since no specific values for `a` and `b` are provided other than these conditions, we assume they hold true based on the precondition.

Therefore, `counter` is set to 1 under these conditions.

Output: **1**
