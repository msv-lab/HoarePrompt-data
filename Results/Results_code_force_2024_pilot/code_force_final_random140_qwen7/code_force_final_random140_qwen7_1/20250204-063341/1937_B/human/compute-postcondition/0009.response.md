Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a)`.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `i` and `len(a)`.
3. **Check the current state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `a` is a stripped input string from the user, and `len(a)` is the length of this string.
4. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` (which is 0) must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Since `i` is 0, the loop will execute the first time if `len(a)` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True**
