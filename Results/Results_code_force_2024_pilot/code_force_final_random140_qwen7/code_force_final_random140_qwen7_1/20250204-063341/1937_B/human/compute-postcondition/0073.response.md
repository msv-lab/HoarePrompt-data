Output State: **`j` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `counter` is 2 if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', otherwise `counter` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. Given the initial condition where `counter` is 1 if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', and considering `j` is 1, the new value of `counter` will be 2 under the same conditions. If these conditions are not met, `counter` remains unchanged.
