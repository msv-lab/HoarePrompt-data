Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` increments `ans` by the value of `b[i]`. Since `i` is less than `len(a)` in the initial state, the condition for accessing `b[i]` is valid. The value of `ans` is updated to its original value plus `b[i]`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
