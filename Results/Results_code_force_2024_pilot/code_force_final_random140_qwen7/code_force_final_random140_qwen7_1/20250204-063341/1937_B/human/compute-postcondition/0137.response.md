Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is increased by `a[i] + b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `ans` was being updated. The values of `i` and the condition `i < len(a)` remain unchanged, and the increment operation for `ans` does not occur because the `break` statement interrupts the execution before the line `ans = ans + a[i] + b[i]` can be processed.
