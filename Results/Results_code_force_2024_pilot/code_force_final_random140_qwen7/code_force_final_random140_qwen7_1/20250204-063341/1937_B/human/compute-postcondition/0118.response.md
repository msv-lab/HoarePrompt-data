Postcondition: **`i`, `j`, `counter`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work` retain their values as described in the precondition. If `work` is `True` and `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `i` becomes 2, `ans` is updated to append `a[i-1]` to the original `ans`, and `work` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `i` remains either `len(a)` or 2, `ans` is updated to append `a[i]` or `b[i]` to the original `ans`, and `work` remains `True`. If `work` is `False`, then `i` is 1, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is 1 if `a[len(a) - 1]` is '0' and `b[len(a) - 2]` is '1'. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is equal to `b[0]`, and `work` is `False`.**
