Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the loop's conditions, and `work` is `False`**.

The code `counter = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `counter`. Since the initial value of `counter` was `2`, it is decremented to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
