Postcondition: **`j` is 3, `counter` is either 3 or 4, `i` is `len(a)`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the final concatenated result based on the conditions inside the loop, and `work` is `False` if the loop terminated because `i + 1` was equal to `len(a)`, or it follows the last condition checked before the loop terminated. Additionally, the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is false since `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`**.
