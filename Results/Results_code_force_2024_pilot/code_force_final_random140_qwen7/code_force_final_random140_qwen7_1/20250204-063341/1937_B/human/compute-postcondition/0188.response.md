Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is `len(a)`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[i]`, and `work` is `True`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables listed in the initial state. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was inside. All other variables retain their initial values.
