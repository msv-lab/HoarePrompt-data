Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)` and equals `i + 1`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[i-1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` now equals `i + 1`. The value of `ans` remains the same as its original value plus `a[i-1]` because the addition operation that defines `ans` was done before the increment.
