Output State: **`ans` is increased by `b[i]`, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state mentions that `i` must be less than `len(a)`, but after executing the code, the value of `i` is simply increased by 1. The value of `ans` is still increased by `b[i]` from the previous state, and now `i` is one more than its previous value.
