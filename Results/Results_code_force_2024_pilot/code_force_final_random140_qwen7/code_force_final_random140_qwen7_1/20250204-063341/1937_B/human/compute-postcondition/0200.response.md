Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the concatenation of `ans` and `a[i]`, and `work` is `True` or `False` depending on the condition in the if statement.**

The code `ans += a[i]` updates the value of `ans` by concatenating it with the `i-th` character of the string `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
