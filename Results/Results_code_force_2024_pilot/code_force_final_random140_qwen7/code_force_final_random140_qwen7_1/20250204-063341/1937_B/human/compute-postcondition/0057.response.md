Postcondition: `ans` is the sum of elements from arrays `a` and `b` based on the value of `i`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False, and `i` is incremented. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is updated to include the value of `b[i]` and `i` is incremented, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the if condition is not met, `ans` is updated to include the value of `b[i]` and `i` is incremented.
