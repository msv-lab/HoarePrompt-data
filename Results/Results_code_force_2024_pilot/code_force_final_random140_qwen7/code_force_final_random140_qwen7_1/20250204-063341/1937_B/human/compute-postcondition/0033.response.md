Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `ans` is either `a[0] + a[1]` or `a[0] + b[1] + a[1]`; `work` is either `True` or remains as `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])`; `_` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string from user and its length must be at least 3; `b` is the stripped input string from user**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` increments `ans` by the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is either 1 or 2, `ans` will be updated to either `a[0] + a[1]` or `a[0] + b[1] + a[1]` depending on the initial value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
