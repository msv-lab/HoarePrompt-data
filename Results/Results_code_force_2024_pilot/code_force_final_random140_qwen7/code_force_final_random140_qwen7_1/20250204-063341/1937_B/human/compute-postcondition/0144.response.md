Output State: **`ans` is increased by `b[i]`, `i` is less than `len(a)`; `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was initially less than `len(a)`, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` is still less than `len(a)`. The values of `ans` and `i` are updated, while the condition involving `a` remains unchanged.
