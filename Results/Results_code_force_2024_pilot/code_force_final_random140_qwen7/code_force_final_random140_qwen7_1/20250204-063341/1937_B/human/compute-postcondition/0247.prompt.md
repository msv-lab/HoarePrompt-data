Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is either 2 or 3, `i` is `len(a)`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the final concatenated result based on the conditions inside the loop, and `work` is `False` if the loop terminated because `i + 1` was equal to `len(a)`, or it follows the last condition checked before the loop terminated.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is 3, `counter` is 1, `i` is `len(a)`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the final concatenated result based on the conditions inside the loop, and `work` is `False` if the loop terminated because `i + 1` was equal to `len(a)`, or it follows the last condition checked before the loop terminated. Additionally, the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` remains false since `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 4, `counter` is 2, `i` is `len(a)`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the final concatenated result based on the conditions inside the loop, and `work` is `False` if the loop terminated because `i + 1` was equal to `len(a)`, or it follows the last condition checked before the loop terminated. If `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'` is true, then `counter` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is incremented by 1 if `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`; otherwise, the values of `j`, `counter`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
