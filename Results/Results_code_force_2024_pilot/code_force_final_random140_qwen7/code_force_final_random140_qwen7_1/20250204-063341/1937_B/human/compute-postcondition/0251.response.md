Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through test cases where each test case includes a binary string of length n for two rows of a grid. It returns different outputs based on the binary strings provided in the test cases.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two binary strings of equal length n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). The function does not accept any parameters itself but operates on the input provided within these test cases. The exact nature of the output for each test case is not specified in the given information, but it implies that the function processes the binary strings to produce some result or perform some operation based on their values.
