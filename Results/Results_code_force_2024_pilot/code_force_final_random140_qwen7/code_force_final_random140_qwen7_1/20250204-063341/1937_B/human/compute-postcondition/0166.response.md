Postcondition: `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is either 2 or 3, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the loop's conditions, and `work` remains `False`. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is true, then `counter` is set to either 2 or 3 depending on the original value.
