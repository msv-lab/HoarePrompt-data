Output State: **`t` is an integer input from `sys.stdin.readline`, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to hold the integer value input from `sys.stdin.readline`, and it is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 10^4. The precondition that `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline` remains unchanged.
