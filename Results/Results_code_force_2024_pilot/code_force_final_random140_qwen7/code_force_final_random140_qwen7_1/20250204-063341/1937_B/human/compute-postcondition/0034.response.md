Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `ans` is either `a[0] + a[1]` or `a[0] + b[1] + a[1]`; `work` is `False`; `_` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string from user and its length must be at least 3; `b` is the stripped input string from user.**

Explanation: The line `work = False` sets the variable `work` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
