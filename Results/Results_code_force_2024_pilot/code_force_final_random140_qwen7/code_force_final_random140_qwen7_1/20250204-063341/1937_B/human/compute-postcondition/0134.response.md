Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is increased by `a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` must be less than `len(a)` in the initial state, this condition remains valid after the code execution. The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to its current value.
