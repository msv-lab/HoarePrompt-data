Postcondition: `i` is 0, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is 1 if `a[len(a) - 1]` is '0' and `b[len(a) - 2]` is '1'. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is `True`.
