Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is `ans` plus `a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is less than `len(a)`, the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `a`. The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. The condition `i < len(a)` remains true as the code does not modify `i` or `a`.
