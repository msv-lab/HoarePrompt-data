Postcondition: **`i` is either 1, 2, or 3; `ans` is either `a[0] + a[1]`, `a[0] + b[1] + a[1]`, or `ans + b[i]`; `work` is either `False` or remains as `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])`; `_` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string from user and its length must be at least 3; `b` is the stripped input string from user.**
