Postcondition: `i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[i]` if `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `b[i]` if `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, or `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[i-1]` if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`.
