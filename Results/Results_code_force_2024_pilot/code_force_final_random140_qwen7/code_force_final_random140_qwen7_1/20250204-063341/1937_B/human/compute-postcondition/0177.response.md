Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is 0, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, and `work` remains `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `i = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
