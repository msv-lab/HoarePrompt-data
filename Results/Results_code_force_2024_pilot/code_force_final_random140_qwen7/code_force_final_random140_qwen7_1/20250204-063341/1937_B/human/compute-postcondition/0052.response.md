Postcondition: `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is updated to the previous value of `ans` plus `b[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1, potentially breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
