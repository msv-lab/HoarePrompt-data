Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `ans` is `ans + b[i]`; `work` is either `True` or remains as `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])`; `_` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string from user and its length must be at least 3; `b` is the stripped input string from user.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` increments the value of `ans` by `b[i]`. The value of `i` remains either 1 or 2, and the value of `work` remains unchanged unless `i` changes, which it does not here. All other variables remain as their initial states.
