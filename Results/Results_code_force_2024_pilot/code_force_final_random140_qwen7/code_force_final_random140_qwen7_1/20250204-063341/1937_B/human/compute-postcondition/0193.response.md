Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is either 2 or `len(a)`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with either `b[i]` (if `i + 1 != len(a)`) or the previous value of `ans` (if `i + 1 == len(a)`), and `work` is `True` or `False` depending on the condition in the if statement.**
