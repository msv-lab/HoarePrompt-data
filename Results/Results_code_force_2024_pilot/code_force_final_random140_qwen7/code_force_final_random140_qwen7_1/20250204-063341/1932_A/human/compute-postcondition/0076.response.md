Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `thorn` is 0
   - `s` is a non-empty string
   - `i` is a character other than '@'

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is not '@'.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was a character other than '@'.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be a character other than '@' in the current iteration.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - Since `i` is a character from the string `s`, it will change with each iteration.
   - If `i` is not '@', the loop will continue.

5. **Post-Iteration State:**
   - `thorn` remains 0 unless `i` is '@', but since we are considering the next iteration where `i` is still a character other than '@', `thorn` remains 0.
   - `s` remains the same non-empty string.
   - `i` changes to the next character in the string `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`thorn` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is a character other than '@'**
