Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '@', and '*'. It counts the number of valid paths through each string, where a valid path is defined as a sequence that does not contain two consecutive '*'. If two consecutive '*' are found, the counting stops for that particular string. The function outputs the count of valid paths for each string and does not return any value explicitly.**
