Output State: **`thorn` is 1, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is '*'**.

Explanation: The variable `thorn` was initially set to 0. After executing the line `thorn += 1`, `thorn` is incremented by 1, making its value 1. The values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged, with `s` being a non-empty string and `i` being '*'.
