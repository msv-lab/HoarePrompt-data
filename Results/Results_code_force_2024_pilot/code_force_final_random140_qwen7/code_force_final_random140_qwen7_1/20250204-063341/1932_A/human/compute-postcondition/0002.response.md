Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(input())` takes a user input and converts it into a list of characters. The variable `t` and `len` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and `len` retains its initial value as an input integer. The new variable `s` is created and assigned a list of characters from the user input.
