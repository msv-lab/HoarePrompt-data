Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string of n characters. These characters represent cells in a grid, where '.' indicates an empty cell, '@' indicates a cell with a coin, and '*' indicates a cell with thorns. The function counts the number of coins ('@') in each string and prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function outputs nothing and ends.**
