Postcondition: **`thorn` is either 2, 3, 4, or 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty list of characters (with the first character removed), `ret` is 0, and the character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` remains unchanged unless it is '*', in which case the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `thorn` equals 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
