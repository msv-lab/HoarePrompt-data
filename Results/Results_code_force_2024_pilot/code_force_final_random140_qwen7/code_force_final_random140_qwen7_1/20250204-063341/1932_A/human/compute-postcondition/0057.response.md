Output State: **`thorn` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to '@'**

Explanation: The code `thorn = 0` does not change the value of `s` or `i`. It only updates `thorn` to 0, which was already its value in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
