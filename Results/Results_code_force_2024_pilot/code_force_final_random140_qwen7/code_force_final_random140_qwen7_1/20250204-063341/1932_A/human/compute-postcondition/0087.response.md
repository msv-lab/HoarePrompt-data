Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `thorn` is either 0 or 1.
   - `s` remains the same non-empty string.
   - `i` changes to the next character in the string `s`.
   - If `thorn` equals 2, the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `i` is not '*', `thorn` remains 0.
   - If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using `for i in s`.

3. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over the characters of `s`, the variable `i` will change to the next character in `s`.
   - The variable `thorn` will remain unchanged unless `i` is '*', but since we are starting a new iteration, `i` is not yet set to '*'.
   - The variable `s` remains the same as it was at the beginning of the loop.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `thorn` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (either 0 or 1).
- `s` remains the same.
- `i` changes to the next character in the string `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`thorn` is either 0 or 1, `s` remains the same non-empty string, `i` changes to the next character in the string `s`**.
