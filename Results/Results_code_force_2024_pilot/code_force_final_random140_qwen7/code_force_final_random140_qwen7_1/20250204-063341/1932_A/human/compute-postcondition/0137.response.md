Output State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character (excluding the first character), `ret` is 2, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the next character in the list `s`**

Explanation: The code `ret += 1` increments the value of `ret` by 1. Given that `ret` was initially 1, after executing this line, `ret` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
