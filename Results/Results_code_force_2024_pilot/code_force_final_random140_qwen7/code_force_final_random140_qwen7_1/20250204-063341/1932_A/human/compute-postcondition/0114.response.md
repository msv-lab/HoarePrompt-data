Output State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, and the character `i` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, and `i`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
