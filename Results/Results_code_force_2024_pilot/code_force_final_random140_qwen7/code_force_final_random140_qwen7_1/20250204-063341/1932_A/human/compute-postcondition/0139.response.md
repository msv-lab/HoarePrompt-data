Output State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character (excluding the first character), `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 2, `i` is the next character in the list `s', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is inside. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged. The only thing that happens is that the program exits the loop or conditional block it was in.
