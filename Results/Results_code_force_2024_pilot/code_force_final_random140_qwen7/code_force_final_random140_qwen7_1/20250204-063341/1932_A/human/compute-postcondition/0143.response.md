Postcondition: `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character (excluding the first character), `ret` is 1, `thorn` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether `i` equals '*', `i` is the next character in the list `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
