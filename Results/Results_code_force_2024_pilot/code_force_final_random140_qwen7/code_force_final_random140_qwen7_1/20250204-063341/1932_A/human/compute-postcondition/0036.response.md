Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in s`. This means the loop iterates over each character in the list `s`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`i`**: This is the variable used to iterate over the list `s`. At the start of each iteration, `i` takes the value of the current character in the list `s`.
   - **`s`**: Since `i` is iterating over the list `s`, the list itself does not change within the loop body. However, the state of `s` might change if the loop body modifies it, but since no modifications are mentioned, we assume `s` remains the same.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - **`thorn`**: This variable is not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted based on the loop iteration.
   - **`t`**: This variable is not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted based on the loop iteration.
   - **`len`**: This variable is not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted based on the loop iteration.
   - **`ret`**: This variable is not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted based on the loop iteration.
   - **`@`**: This is a placeholder for an index, which is not directly affected by the loop iteration unless specified otherwise.

Given the information, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `s`.

Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in the list `s`. The list `s` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, `s` stays the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`thorn` is either 3 or 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty list of characters (with the first character removed), `ret` is 0, and the character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` remains unchanged unless it is '*', in which case the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`**.
