### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of the \(n\) cyclic shifts of \(a\) are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\) from the input.
   - It checks three specific conditions:
     - If \(n = k\), it prints an array where every element is `1`. This ensures that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
     - If \(k = 1\), it prints an array where elements are increasing (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, ...]`). Only one cyclic shift will be sorted.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid array can be generated.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Case \(n = k\):**
     - If \(n = k\), the solution correctly prints an array of all `1`s, ensuring all cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - **Case \(k = 1\):**
     - If \(k = 1\), the solution correctly prints an array with increasing values, ensuring only one cyclic shift is sorted.
   - **Other Cases:**
     - For other cases, the solution correctly prints `-1` because no valid array can be generated to meet the requirement of having exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts when \(n \neq k\) and \(k \neq 1\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases like \(n = k\) and \(k = 1\) appropriately.
   - However, the solution does not handle other cases where \(k > 1\) and \(n > k\). Specifically, the solution does not provide a way to generate an array where exactly \(k\) out of \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted when \(k > 1\).

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the example input:
     ```
     3
     2 2
     3 1
     3 2
     ```
   - For the first test case (\(n = 2\), \(k = 2\)), the solution prints `[1, 1]`, which is correct.
   - For the second test case (\(n = 3\), \(k = 1\)), the solution prints `[1, 2, 3]`, which is also correct.
   - For the third test case (\(n = 3\), \(k = 2\)), the solution prints `-1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `[69420, 69, 420]` as shown in the example output.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided solution does not cover all cases where \(k > 1\) and \(n > k\). It only handles the cases where \(n = k\) or \(k = 1\). Therefore, the solution is incomplete and incorrect for some test cases.
