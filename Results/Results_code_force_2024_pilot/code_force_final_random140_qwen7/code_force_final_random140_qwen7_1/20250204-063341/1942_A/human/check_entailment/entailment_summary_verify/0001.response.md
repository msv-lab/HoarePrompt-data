### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of the \(n\) cyclic shifts of \(a\) are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\) from the input.
   - It checks three specific conditions:
     - If \(n = k\), it prints an array where every element is `1`. This ensures that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
     - If \(k = 1\), it prints an array where elements are increasing (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, ...]`). Only one cyclic shift will be sorted.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid array can be generated.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Case \(n = k\):**
     - If \(n = k\), the solution correctly prints an array of all `1`s, ensuring all cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - **Case \(k = 1\):**
     - If \(k = 1\), the solution correctly prints an array with increasing values, ensuring only one cyclic shift is sorted.
   - **Other Cases:**
     - For other cases, the solution correctly prints `-1` because no valid array can be generated to meet the requirement of having exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts when \(n \neq k\) and \(k \neq 1\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases like \(n = k\) and \(k = 1\) appropriately.
   - However, the solution does not cover all possible cases where a valid array might exist. For example, consider the case where \(n = 3\) and \(k = 2\). The solution incorrectly prints `-1` in this scenario, but a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3]` or `[1, 3, 2]`, where two out of the three cyclic shifts are sorted.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided solution does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate valid arrays for certain values of \(n\) and \(k\).
