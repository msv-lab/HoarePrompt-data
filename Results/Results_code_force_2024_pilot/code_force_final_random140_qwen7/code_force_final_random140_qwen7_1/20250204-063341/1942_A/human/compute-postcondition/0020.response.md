Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `n` and `k` are integers. If `n` equals `k`, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, both `n` and `k` retain their original values as integers split from the input string, and both are at least 2.

3. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 (since `range(x)` generates numbers from 0 to x-1).
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know what happens inside it, but we know that the loop will execute again if the condition is met.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The state of `n` and `k` remains unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.
   - The key variable that controls the loop execution is `int(input())`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop can potentially execute again based on the input.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` and `k` are integers, and the loop can execute again if `int(input())` is at least 1**. 

However, since we need to provide specific values for `n` and `k` as per the given conditions, let's assume the initial values of `n` and `k` were derived from an input string and are at least 2. Therefore, the state remains the same as the previous iteration unless modified within the loop body.

State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 2, `k` is an integer that is at least 2, and the loop can execute again if `int(input())` is at least 1**.
