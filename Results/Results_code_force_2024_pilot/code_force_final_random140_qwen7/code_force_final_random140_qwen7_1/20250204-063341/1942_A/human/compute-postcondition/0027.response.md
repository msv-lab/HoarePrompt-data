Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more test cases provided via `int(input())`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` and `k` will retain their values from the last test case processed. Specifically, `n` will be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `k` will be an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. If the final test case has `n` equal to `k`, the output will be `'1 ' * n` (excluding the trailing space). If `n` is not equal to `k`, the output will be the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `k` is 1, the output will be the same sequence. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `k` is not 1, the output will be `-1`.

In summary, after all iterations, `n` and `k` will reflect the values from the last input pair, and the output will depend on whether `n` equals `k` or `k` equals 1, otherwise it will be `-1`.
