Given the initial state where `n` is an input integer and `k` is an input integer with the current value of `n` being equal to the current value of `k`, we need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:

```python
print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
```

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The string `('1 ' * n)` creates a string consisting of `n` occurrences of the substring `"1 "`.
2. For example, if `n` is 3, then `('1 ' * n)` would result in the string `"1 1 1 "`.
3. The `[:-1]` operation removes the last character from the string, which in this case is the trailing space.
4. Therefore, the resulting string will be `"1 1 1"` (if `n` is 3).

Since `n` is equal to `k`, and both are input integers, the exact printed output will depend on the value of `n` (or `k`). However, the format of the output will always be a string of `n` ones separated by spaces, ending just before the last space.

Output: **"1 " repeated n times**
