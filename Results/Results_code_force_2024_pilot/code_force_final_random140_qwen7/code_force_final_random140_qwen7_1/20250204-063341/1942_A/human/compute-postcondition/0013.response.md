Output State: **`n` is an integer input split from the input string, `k` is an integer input split from the input string, the input value must be at least 2**.

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input separated by a space and splits them into `n` and `k`. The initial condition that the input value must be at least 2 remains valid, but now `n` and `k` are specific integers obtained from the input.
