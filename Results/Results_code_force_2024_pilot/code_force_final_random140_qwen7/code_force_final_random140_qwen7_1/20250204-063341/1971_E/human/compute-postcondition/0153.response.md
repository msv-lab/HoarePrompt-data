Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(a))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Calculate the new state of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates, the next value of `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

4. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Therefore, `i` must be 2 and `len(a)` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the state of `ad`**: The list `ad` contains the value `a[1] - a[0]`. This value does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`, and `len(a)` must be greater than 2**
