Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an input integer, `v` is an empty list, `m` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `ql` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `v`, and `m`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `q` becomes an input integer, `v` remains an empty list, and `m` remains 0.
