Output State: `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` up to the second last element of `a`, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer minus the sum of all `a[s-1]` values encountered during the loop, `v` is an empty list, `m` is the cumulative sum of `b[s-1] + (bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]))` for each iteration, `l` is the total number of iterations of the loop, `ql` is the final value after subtracting all `a[s-1]` values from the initial input integer, `s` is the final index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `a` contains the original input integer followed by all integers inputted by the user, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers inputted by the user, `bd` is [0].

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ad` will contain the differences between every pair of consecutive elements in the list `a`. The list `ad` will have one less element than `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `a` plus one. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `q`, `v`, `m`, `l`, `ql`, `s`, `a`, `b`, and `bd`) will retain their final states as described by the given output states after the first three iterations.
