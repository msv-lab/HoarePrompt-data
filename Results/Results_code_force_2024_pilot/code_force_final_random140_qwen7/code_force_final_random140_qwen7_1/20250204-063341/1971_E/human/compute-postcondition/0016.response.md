Output State: **`i` is 2, `len(a)` must be less than `len(b)`, `bd` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `bd` is `b[2] - b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing the code, `i` is incremented to 2. The value appended to `bd` is `b[2] - b[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the condition `len(a) must be less than len(b)` still holds true.
