Output State: **`ad` is [0, 1, 2, a[4] - a[3]], `i` is 4, `len(a)` is greater than 1**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 4, `a[i]` is `a[4]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[3]`. Therefore, `a[4] - a[3]` is appended to `ad`, making the updated `ad` list `[0, 1, 2, a[4] - a[3]]`. The values of `i` and the condition `len(a) > 1` remain unchanged.
