Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t, n, k, q, a, b, and d. t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. n, k, and q are integers such that k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. a is a strictly increasing list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, and a_k = n. b is a strictly increasing list of k integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1. Each query d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ n. The function processes t test cases, each containing n, k, q, a, b, and a series of queries d. For each query d, the function determines the corresponding value based on the lists a and b and returns the results for all queries.**
