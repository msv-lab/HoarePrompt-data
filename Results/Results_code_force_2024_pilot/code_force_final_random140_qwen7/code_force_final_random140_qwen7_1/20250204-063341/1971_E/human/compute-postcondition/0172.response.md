Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is increased by 1.
   - `v` contains the value `[ad[i] / bd[i]]`.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `len(a) - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration.
   - Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. After increasing `i` by 1, `i` becomes `k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must be less than `len(a)`, which means `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1`.

5. **Determine the new value of `v`**:
   - `v` contains the value `[ad[i] / bd[i]]`.
   - After the increase, `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `v` will contain the value `[ad[i + 1] / bd[i + 1]]`.

Given the above steps, let's summarize the state adjustments:

- `i` is increased by 1, so if `i` was `k` before, it becomes `k + 1`.
- `v` will now contain the value `[ad[k + 1] / bd[k + 1]]`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we'll denote it as `k` and express the new state in terms of `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `v` contains the value `[ad[k + 1] / bd[k + 1]]`**
