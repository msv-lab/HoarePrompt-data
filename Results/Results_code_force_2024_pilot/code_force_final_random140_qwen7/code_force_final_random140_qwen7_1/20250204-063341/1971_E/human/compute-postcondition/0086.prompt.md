Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ad` is [0], `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer minus the sum of all `a[s-1]` values encountered during the loop, `v` is an empty list, `m` is the cumulative sum of `b[s-1] + (bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]))` for each iteration, `l` is the total number of iterations of the loop, `ql` is the final value after subtracting all `a[s-1]` values from the initial input integer, `s` is the final index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `a` is updated to include 0 followed by integers inputted by the user, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers inputted by the user, `bd` is [0]
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ad` is [0, `a[i] - a[i - 1]`], `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer minus the sum of all `a[s-1]` values encountered during the loop, `v` is an empty list, `m` is the cumulative sum of `b[s-1] + (bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]))` for each iteration, `l` is the total number of iterations of the loop, `ql` is the final value after subtracting all `a[s-1]` values from the initial input integer, `s` is the final index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `a` must have at least two elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers inputted by the user, `bd` is [0]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ad` is now [0, `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `a[i+1] - a[i]`], `i` is `len(a) + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ad` is now `[0, a[i] - a[i - 1], a[i + 1] - a[i], a[i] - a[i - 1]]`, `i` is `len(a) + 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
