Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an input integer minus the value of `a[s-1]`, `v` is an empty list, `m` is 0, `l` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.**

The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect the variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
