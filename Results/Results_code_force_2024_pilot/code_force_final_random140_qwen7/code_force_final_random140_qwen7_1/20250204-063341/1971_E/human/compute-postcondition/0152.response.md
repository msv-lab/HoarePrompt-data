Output State: **`i` is 1; `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]` and `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[0]`. Therefore, `ad` now contains the value `a[1] - a[0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
