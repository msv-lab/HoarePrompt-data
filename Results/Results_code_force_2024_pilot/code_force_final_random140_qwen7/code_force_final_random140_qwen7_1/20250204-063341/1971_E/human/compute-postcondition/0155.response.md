Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `range(1, len(a))`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value (3) to 4.
   - The new value of `i` should be 4.
   - Since `i` is now 4, it must be checked if `i` is still less than `len(a)` to determine if the loop should continue.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - The variable `i` needs to be updated to 4.
   - The list `ad` does not change because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `ad` within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 4, `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`**
