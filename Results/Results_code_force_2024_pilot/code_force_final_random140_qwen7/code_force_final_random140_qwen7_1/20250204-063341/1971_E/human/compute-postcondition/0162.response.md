Output State: **`i` is 2, `b` is a non-empty list, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`, `bd` is now `[b[1] - b[0], b[i] - b[i - 1]]`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2, `b` is a non-empty list, `ad` is an empty list, and `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`. The code appends `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to `bd`. Since `i` is 2, `b[i]` is `b[2]` and `b[i - 1]` is `b[1]`. Therefore, `bd` becomes `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1]]`.
