Output State: `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `v` contains the list of values obtained by dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(b) - 1`) by the corresponding element in `bd` (from index 1 to `len(b) - 1`).

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `len(b) - 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`, and `a` has `len(b)` elements. The list `v` will contain the results of the division operation performed in each iteration of the loop, which is `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `len(b) - 1`.
