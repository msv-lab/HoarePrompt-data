Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `v` contains the list `[ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of list `a`. The list `v` will contain the results of dividing each element of `ad` starting from `ad[1]` up to `ad[len(a)-1]` by the corresponding element in `bd` starting from `bd[1]` up to `bd[len(a)-1]`. This means `v` will have `len(a) - 1` elements, as the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`, appending the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to `v` in each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `q` is an input integer minus the value of `a[s-1]`, `v` is an empty list, `m` is the value of `b[s-1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `q` is an input integer minus `a[s-1]` - `a[s-1]`, `v` is an empty list, `m` is `b[s-1] + (bd[s] * ql) // ad[s]`, `l` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and if `a[s]` equals `ql`, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `q` is an input integer minus `a[s-1]` - `a[s-1]`, `v` is an empty list, `m` is `b[s-1]` plus `(bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]))`, `l` is 2, `ql` is the input integer minus `a[s-1]`, and `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
