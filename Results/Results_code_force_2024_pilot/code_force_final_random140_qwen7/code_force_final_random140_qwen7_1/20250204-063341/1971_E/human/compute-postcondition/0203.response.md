Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `l` and the value of `q`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `l` and `q`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is calculated as `m` (0 + `b[s - 1]`) plus `bd[s]` times `ql` divided by `ad[s]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.
   - `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`.
   - `l` is 2.
   - `q` is the same as before.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `q` iterations. Since `l` starts at 2 and the loop runs from `l` in the range `q`, the loop will execute until `l` reaches `q`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - `q` remains the same as before.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `q`.

**State: **`m` is `m` (0 + `b[s - 1]`) plus `bd[s]` times `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is 3, `q` is the same as before**
