Postcondition: `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is an integer, and after executing the if-else block, if `a[s] == ql`, we continue the loop; otherwise, the values of `v`, `m`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.
