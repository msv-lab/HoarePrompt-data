Output State: **`i` is 3, `len(a)` must be less than `len(b)`, `bd` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `bd` is `b[2] - b[1]`, and `bd` now has the additional element `b[3] - b[2]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `b[i] - b[i - 1]` becomes `b[3] - b[2]`. Therefore, the last element of `bd` changes from `b[2] - b[1]` to `b[3] - b[2]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
