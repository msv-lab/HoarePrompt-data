Output State: **`i` is 3, `b` is a non-empty list, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the values `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1]]` and will be updated to include `b[3] - b[2]` if `b` has at least 4 elements, `bd` is now `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], b[i] - b[i - 1]]` since `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to `bd`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `b[i] - b[i - 1]` translates to `b[3] - b[2]`. Since `bd` was initially `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1]]`, after appending `b[3] - b[2]`, `bd` becomes `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], b[3] - b[2]]`. The values of `i`, `b`, `ad`, and the condition for updating `bd` remain unchanged.
