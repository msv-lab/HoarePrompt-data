Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `v` contains the list of values obtained by dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(b) - 1`) by the corresponding element in `bd` (from index 1 to `len(b) - 1`).

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `len(b) - 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`, and `a` has `len(b)` elements. The list `v` will contain the results of the division operation performed in each iteration of the loop, which is `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `len(b) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ad[s] - b[s - 1]))`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is reduced by the value at index `s-1` of list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` is `m` (0 + `b[s - 1]`) plus `bd[s]` times `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is 2, `q` is the same as before.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is `m + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` is 3, `q` is the same as before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
