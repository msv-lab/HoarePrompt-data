Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `q` must be a positive integer, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted. The current value of `ql` is equal to the value at index `s` of list `a`. We continue the loop or iteration we were inside.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `l`, `q`, `m`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the condition for inserting `ql` into the list `a` to keep it sorted also remains the same.
