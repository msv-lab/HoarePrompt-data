Output State: **`v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `i` is `len(a)`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is `0`, `l` is `q`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))**.

Explanation: The code reads a new list `b` from user input, which replaces the previous value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
