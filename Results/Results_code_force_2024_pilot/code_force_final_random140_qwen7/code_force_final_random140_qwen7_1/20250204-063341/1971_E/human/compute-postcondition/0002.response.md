Output State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. The precondition that `t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `k`, and `q` are set to the integers obtained from the input, but their specific values are not known without further input.
