Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `l` and it ranges from `0` to `q - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `q` is an input integer minus the value of `a[s-1]`.
   - `v` is an empty list.
   - `m` is the value of `b[s-1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `l < q`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` would have been incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `l` should be `0` (initial value) if it is the first iteration, or `previous_l + 1` for subsequent iterations.

5. **Update the other variables**:
   - `i`, `q`, `v`, and `m` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not affected by the loop itself.

Given that `l` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `l` should be `1` if it is the second iteration, `2` if it is the third iteration, and so on.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an input integer minus the value of `a[s-1]`, `v` is an empty list, `m` is the value of `b[s-1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, `l` is 1**.
