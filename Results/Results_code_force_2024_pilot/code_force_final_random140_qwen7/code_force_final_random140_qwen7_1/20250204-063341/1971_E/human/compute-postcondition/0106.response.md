Output State: **`v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `ql`. The values of `v`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `ql` is specifically an integer input.
