Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split, `ad` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `bd` is a list containing only one element which is 0, `i` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` was initially set to 1 and the list `a` has more than one element, `i` is incremented to 2. Thus, `ad` now contains two elements: the first being 0 (initial value) and the second being `a[2] - a[1]`.
