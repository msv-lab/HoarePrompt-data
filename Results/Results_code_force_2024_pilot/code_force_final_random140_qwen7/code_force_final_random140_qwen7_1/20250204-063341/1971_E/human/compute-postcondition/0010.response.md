Output State: **`ad` is a list containing three elements: 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, and `a[3] - a[2]`; `i` is 3; `len(a)` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the difference `a[3] - a[2]` is appended to `ad`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
