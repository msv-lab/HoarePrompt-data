Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; t is assigned the value of int(input()).**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range [1, 10^4], after executing the code, `t` is now specifically assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user, which still falls within the same range. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
