Output State: **`i` is 1; `b` is a non-empty list; `ad` is an empty list; `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression `b[i] - b[i - 1]` evaluates to `b[1] - b[0]`. Since `b` is a non-empty list, both `b[0]` and `b[1]` exist, and `bd` becomes a list containing this single value. The variables `i` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `ad` remains an empty list.
