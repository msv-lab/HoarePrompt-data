Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `b` is a non-empty list
   - `ad` is an empty list
   - `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`, and it is now `[b[1] - b[0], b[i] - b[i - 1]]`

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(1, len(b))`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - The list `b` remains unchanged.
   - The list `ad` remains empty.
   - The list `bd` will be updated to include `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, which translates to `b[3] - b[2]` if `b` has at least 3 elements.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `b` remains a non-empty list.
   - `ad` remains an empty list.
   - `bd` will be updated to include `b[3] - b[2]` if `b` has at least 4 elements.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `b` is a non-empty list, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the values `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1]]` and will be updated to include `b[3] - b[2]` if `b` has at least 4 elements**.
