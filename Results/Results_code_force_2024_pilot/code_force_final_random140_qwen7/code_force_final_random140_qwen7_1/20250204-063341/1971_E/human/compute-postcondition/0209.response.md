Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is 3, `q` is the same as before.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The precondition of the initial state is maintained, and the values of the variables are kept as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
