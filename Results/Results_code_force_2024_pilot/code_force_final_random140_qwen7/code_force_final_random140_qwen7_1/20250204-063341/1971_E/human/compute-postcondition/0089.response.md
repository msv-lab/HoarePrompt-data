Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is within the range 1 to `len(b) - 1`.
- `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 at each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is within the range 1 to `len(b) - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.

2. **List `bd`:**
   - The list `bd` is updated with a new element `b[i] - b[i - 1]` at each iteration.
   - Since the loop is about to start a new iteration, the new element `b[i] - b[i - 1]` will be added to `bd` in the next iteration.

### Updated State
- After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.
- The new element `b[i] - b[i - 1]` will be added to `bd`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `len(b)` - 1, `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[i] - b[i - 1]`**.

To be more specific:
- `i` will be `i + 1` (so if `i` was 2 before, it will be 3 now).
- `bd` will have an additional element `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.

So, the final state can be represented as:
State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `len(b)` - 1, `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[i] - b[i - 1]`**.

In a more concrete form:
State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `len(b)` - 1, `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[i + 1] - b[i]`**.
