Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `len(a)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3]]`
   - `a` must have at least 4 elements
   - `i` is `3`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `3`, the loop will continue if `i` is less than `len(a)`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to `4` in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must still have at least 4 elements (since `i` is now `4`, it hasn't exceeded the length of `a` yet).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `v` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` must still have at least 4 elements.
   - `i` will be `4`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3]]`, `a` must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 4**
