Output State: **`v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is 0, `a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a)`, `q` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The variable `m` is assigned the value 0. All other variables retain their initial states.
