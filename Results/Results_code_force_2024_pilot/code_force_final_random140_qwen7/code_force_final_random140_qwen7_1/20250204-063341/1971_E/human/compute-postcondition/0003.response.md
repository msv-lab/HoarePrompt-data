Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split**.

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with a leading zero and appends to it integers obtained from the input split. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged as they are obtained from the input split separately. Therefore, `t` remains an integer within the specified range, and `n`, `k`, and `q` are updated to the values obtained from the input split.
