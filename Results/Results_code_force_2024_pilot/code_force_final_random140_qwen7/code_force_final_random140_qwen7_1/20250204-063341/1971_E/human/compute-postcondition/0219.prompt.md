Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; t is assigned the value of int(input()).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
        print(m, end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `q` is an input integer minus the sum of all `a[s-1]` values encountered during the loop, `v` is an empty list, `m` is the cumulative sum of `b[s-1] + (bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]))` for each iteration, `l` is the total number of iterations of the loop, `ql` is the final value after subtracting all `a[s-1]` values from the initial input integer, and `s` is the final index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `i` is `len(a)`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is `0`, `l` is `q`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` for all `s` from `1` to `len(b) - 1`, plus the sum of `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])` for all `s` from `1` to `len(b) - 1`, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `s` is the final index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is `0` (since it gets reduced until it reaches `0`), `l` is `q`, `q` is the same as before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
