Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(b) - 1` (inclusive). This means the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `b` is a non-empty list.
   - `ad` is an empty list.
   - `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `2`.
   - Since `b` is a non-empty list, `len(b)` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.
   - `ad` remains an empty list because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `ad`.
   - `bd` should contain the value `b[2] - b[1]` if the loop continues, but since the loop body is omitted, `bd` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` changes from 1 to 2.
   - `b` remains a non-empty list.
   - `ad` remains an empty list.
   - `bd` remains a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `b` is a non-empty list, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`**.
