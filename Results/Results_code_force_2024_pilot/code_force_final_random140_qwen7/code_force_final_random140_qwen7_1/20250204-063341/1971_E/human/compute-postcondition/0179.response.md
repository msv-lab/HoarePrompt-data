Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `q` must be a positive integer, `m` is 0, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `ql` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `l` is now an integer input from the user. The precondition that `q` must be a positive integer remains unchanged, as the code does not affect `q`. The values of `m` and `i` remain 0 and 1 respectively.
