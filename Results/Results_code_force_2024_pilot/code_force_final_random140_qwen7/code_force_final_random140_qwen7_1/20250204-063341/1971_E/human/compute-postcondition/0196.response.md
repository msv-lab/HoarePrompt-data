The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution simply moves to the next line without changing any variable values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is 2, `q` is the same as before.**
