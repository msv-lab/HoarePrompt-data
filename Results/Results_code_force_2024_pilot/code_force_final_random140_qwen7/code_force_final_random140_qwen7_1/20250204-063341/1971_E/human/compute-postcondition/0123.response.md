The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the `continue` statement itself, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state includes the initial values of the variables.

Output State: **`v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is `q`.**
