Output State: **`m` is `m` (0 + `b[s - 1]`) plus `bd[s]` times `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is 2, `q` is the same as before.**

In more detail, the value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` to its original value of `0 + b[s - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
