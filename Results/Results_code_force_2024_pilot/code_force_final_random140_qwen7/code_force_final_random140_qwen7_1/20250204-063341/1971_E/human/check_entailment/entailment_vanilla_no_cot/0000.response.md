Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It reads the positions `a` and times `b` for the known points.
   - It calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and `b`.
   - It computes the speeds between consecutive points using the formula \( \text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} \).
3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the queried position `d` lies.
   - If the queried position exactly matches a known point, it directly outputs the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the remaining distance within the current segment and adds the time taken to travel this distance at the current speed.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

The logic seems sound and should handle all the constraints and examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
