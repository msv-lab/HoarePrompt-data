### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem. The program iterates only over the numbers from 0 to 12, whereas it should iterate over all numbers from 1 to \(n\) for each test case. Additionally, the original assessment provides a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues.

However, the annotated code and the program itself do not align with the problem description. The annotation states that the function `func_1` computes the sum of the digits for a single number, but the program as written does not use this function in a way that would solve the problem. Instead, it calls `func_1` with numbers from 0 to 12, which is not relevant to the problem.

Given that the provided program does not correctly implement the solution and the annotated version does not match the actual program, we should maintain the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
