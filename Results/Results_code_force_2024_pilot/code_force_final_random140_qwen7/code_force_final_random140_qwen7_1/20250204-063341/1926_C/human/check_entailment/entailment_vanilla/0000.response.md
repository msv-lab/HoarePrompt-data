Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - This function works correctly for any non-negative integer `n`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program initializes `soma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (inclusive).
   - For each number `i` in this range, it calls `func_1(i)` and adds the result to `soma`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `soma`.

### Problem Description:
- The problem requires calculating the sum of the numbers after replacing each integer from 1 to `n` with the sum of its digits.
- The provided program does not match the problem requirements because:
  - It only processes numbers from 0 to 12.
  - It does not handle the input `t` (the number of test cases) or the actual values of `n` specified in the test cases.

### Example Provided:
- The example provided in the problem description shows how to calculate the sum for specific values of `n` (e.g., `n=12`, `n=1`, etc.).
- However, the given program only calculates the sum for the numbers 0 through 12, which is not what the problem requires.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It only processes a fixed set of numbers (0 to 12) and does not handle multiple test cases or the variable `n` as required.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
