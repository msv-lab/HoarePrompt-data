Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The program initializes `soma` and adds the result of `func_1(i)` for `i` in the range 0 to 12. However, the problem requires processing up to `n` for multiple test cases, not just a fixed range of 0 to 12. Additionally, the program should read input and handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement. The current implementation is incomplete and does not address the full requirements of the problem.
