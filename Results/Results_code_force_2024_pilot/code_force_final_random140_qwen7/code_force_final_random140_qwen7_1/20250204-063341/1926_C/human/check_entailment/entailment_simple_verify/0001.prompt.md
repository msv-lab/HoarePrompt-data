You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program: 
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))



- Annotated Code: 
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the positive integer n.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - This function works correctly for any non-negative integer `n`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program initializes `soma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (inclusive).
   - For each number `i` in this range, it calls `func_1(i)` and adds the result to `soma`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `soma`.

### Problem Description:
- The problem requires calculating the sum of the numbers after replacing each integer from 1 to `n` with the sum of its digits.
- The provided program does not match the problem requirements because:
  - It only processes numbers from 0 to 12.
  - It does not handle the input `t` (the number of test cases) or the actual values of `n` specified in the test cases.

### Example Provided:
- The example provided in the problem description shows how to calculate the sum for specific values of `n` (e.g., `n=12`, `n=1`, etc.).
- However, the given program only calculates the sum for the numbers 0 through 12, which is not what the problem requires.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It only processes a fixed set of numbers (0 to 12) and does not handle multiple test cases or the variable `n` as required.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
