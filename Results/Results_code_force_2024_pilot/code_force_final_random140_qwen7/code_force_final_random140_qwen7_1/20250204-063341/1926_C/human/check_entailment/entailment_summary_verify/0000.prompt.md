You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a positive integer n within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and returns the sum of its digits.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program calculates the sum of the digits for numbers from 0 to 12 instead of calculating the sum of the digits for numbers from 1 to \(n\) for each test case. This is evident from the loop `for i in range(13)` which only processes numbers up to 12, and the function `func_1` which computes the sum of digits for a single number.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over the range from 1 to \(n\) for each test case and compute the sum of the digits for each number in that range. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

t = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    current_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        current_sum += func_1(i)
    results.append(current_sum)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected program will correctly handle the problem description for every potential case.
