Output State: **The program returns the sum of the digits of the positive integer n.**

Given that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\), the code converts `n` to a string, iterates over each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up. The result of this summation is returned.
