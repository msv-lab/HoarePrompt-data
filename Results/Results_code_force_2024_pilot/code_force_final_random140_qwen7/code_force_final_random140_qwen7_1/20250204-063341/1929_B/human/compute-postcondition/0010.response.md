Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 999\), `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged from its initial state.
