Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three parameters t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. It returns a value based on the conditions provided for n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts `t`, `n`, and `k` as inputs and returns a value depending on the conditions specified for `n` and `k`.
