Given the initial state where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 999\), `n` is the first integer input, and `k` is the second integer input, the code snippet `print(k // 2 + 1)` will execute.

Here, `k` is the second integer input. The expression `k // 2 + 1` performs integer division of `k` by 2 and then adds 1 to the result. Since `k` is an integer, the result of this operation will also be an integer.

To determine the exact output, we need to know the value of `k`. However, since `k` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe the operation in general terms.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the second integer input)**
