Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 999\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts based on whitespace, and converts each part to an integer. The values of `t` remain unchanged, and `n` and `k` are assigned the respective integers from the input.
