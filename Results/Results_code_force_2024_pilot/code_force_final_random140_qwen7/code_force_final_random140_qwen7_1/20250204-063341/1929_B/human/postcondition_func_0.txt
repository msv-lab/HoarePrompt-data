The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each involving two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, it calculates and prints either \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\) or \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\) based on the condition that \(k\) is even and \(\frac{k}{2}\) is odd. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the calculated results for each test case.
