Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 0. This information about `t` is not directly relevant to the `print(sum(A[::2]))` statement.
   - `n` is an input integer. This is also not directly relevant to the `print(sum(A[::2]))` statement.
   - `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. 

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - `print(sum(A[::2]))`: This line of code will print the sum of every second element in the list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0).

To determine the exact output, we need to know the contents of the list `A`. Since the initial state only mentions that `A` is obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, let's assume the input string is `"1,2,3,4,5"` for clarity (the actual input could be different, but this will help illustrate the process).

- If the input string is `"1,2,3,4,5"`, then `A` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Now, let's apply the slicing `A[::2]` to this list:
- `A[::2]` means every second element starting from index 0. So, it would select the elements at indices 0, 2, and 4.
- Therefore, `A[::2]` would be `[1, 3, 5]`.

Next, we calculate the sum of these elements:
- Sum of `[1, 3, 5]` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

Thus, the output of the `print(sum(A[::2]))` statement will be the sum of every second element in the list `A`.

Output: **9**
