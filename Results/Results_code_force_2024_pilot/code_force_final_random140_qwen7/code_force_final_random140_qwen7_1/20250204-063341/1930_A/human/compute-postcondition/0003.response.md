Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, A is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, splits the string into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list `A` from these integers. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
