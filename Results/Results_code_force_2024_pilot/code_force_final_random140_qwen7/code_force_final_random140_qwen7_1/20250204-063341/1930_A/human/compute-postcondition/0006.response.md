The loop condition is `t`, so the loop can execute again if `t` is non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 4999. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero.

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is non-zero for the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be non-zero, `n` is an input integer, A is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**
