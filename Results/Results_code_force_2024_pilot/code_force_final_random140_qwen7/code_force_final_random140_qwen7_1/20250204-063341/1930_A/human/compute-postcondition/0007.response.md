Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `n` is an input integer, A is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t` and the list `A`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be non-zero, `n` is now an integer obtained from the input, and `A` remains as a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
