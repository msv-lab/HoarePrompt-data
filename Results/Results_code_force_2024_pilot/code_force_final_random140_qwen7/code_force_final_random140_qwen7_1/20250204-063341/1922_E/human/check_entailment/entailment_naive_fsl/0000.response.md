Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate an array with the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified by \(X\). Instead, it generates a sequence of numbers that alternates between the maximum and minimum possible values within the specified range. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. For example, consider \(X = 3\):

- The program would generate a sequence like \([-100000000, 100000000, -100000000, 100000000, \ldots]\).
- This sequence does not necessarily have exactly 3 increasing subsequences, as the increasing subsequences depend on the specific arrangement of the elements.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
