The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and an implied integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). It then performs a series of operations on `X`, tracking the number of steps (`t`) taken until `X` becomes 1. During these operations, it alternates between decrementing `X` by 1 when `X` is odd and halving `X` when `X` is even, recording a sequence of maximum and minimum values (`max` and `min`) in reverse order. Finally, it prints the count of steps (`t`) and the recorded sequence of values.
