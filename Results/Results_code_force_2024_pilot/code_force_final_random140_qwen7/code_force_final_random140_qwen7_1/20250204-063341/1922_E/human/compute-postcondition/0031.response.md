Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` must be greater than 1, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a string combining `max` and the original `ans` with a space in between.**

Explanation: The code `max -= 1` decrements the value of `max` by 1. Since `max` was either 99999998 or 99999999, it now becomes either 99999997 or 99999998 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
