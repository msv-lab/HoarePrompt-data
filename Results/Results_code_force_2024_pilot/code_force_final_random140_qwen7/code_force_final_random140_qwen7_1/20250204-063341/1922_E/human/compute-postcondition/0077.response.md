Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is either 25000000, 0, 49999999, or -1, `ans` is an empty string**.

Explanation: The line `ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans` is trying to concatenate the string `f'{min}'` (which is just the string `'min'`) with a space and then with the current value of `ans`. However, `ans` is not defined before this line, so it defaults to an empty string (`''`). Since `min` is not a variable but a keyword in Python, the actual concatenation would result in `ans` being set to the string `'min '` (a space after `min`). But since `min` is not a variable holding any value, the only thing that changes is that `ans` is now an empty string. The values of `t`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
