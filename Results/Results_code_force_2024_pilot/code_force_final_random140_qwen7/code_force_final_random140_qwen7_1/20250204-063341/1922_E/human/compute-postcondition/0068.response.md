Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is either 50000000 or 0, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 -100000000' or '-100000000 100000000'**

Explanation: The value of `min` is incremented by 1. Since `min` was either -100000000 or -99999999, after adding 1, it becomes -99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
