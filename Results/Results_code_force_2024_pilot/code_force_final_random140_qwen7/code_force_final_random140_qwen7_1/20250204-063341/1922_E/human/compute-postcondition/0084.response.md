Output State: `t` is 33, `i` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is 1, `min` is 1, `ans` is an empty string.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. Given the conditions described, `x` starts as a large number (specifically, it's set to half of the maximum value, which is 50000000) and decreases with each iteration. The loop alternates between decrementing `max` and incrementing `min`, appending the current value of `max` or `min` to `ans` respectively. After 33 iterations, `x` will eventually reach 1, breaking the loop. At this point, `t` will be 33, indicating the number of iterations executed. Both `max` and `min` will be reduced to 1, and `ans` will be an empty string since the loop ends when `x` equals 1.
