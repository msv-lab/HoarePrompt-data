Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '99999999 100000000 ' if `x` is even, or '99999999 -100000000 ' if `x` is odd and not 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans` concatenates the string representation of `max` (which is '99999999') with a space and the current value of `ans`. If `x` was even, `ans` was originally '100000000', so now it becomes '99999999 100000000'. If `x` was odd and not 0, `ans` was originally '-100000000', so now it becomes '99999999 -100000000'. The values of `t`, `i`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.
