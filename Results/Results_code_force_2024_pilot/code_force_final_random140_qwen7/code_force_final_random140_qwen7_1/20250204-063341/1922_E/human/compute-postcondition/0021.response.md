Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '99999999 100000000 ' if `x` is even, or '99999999 -100000000 ' if `x` is odd and not 0.**

Explanation: The value of `max` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 99999999 to 99999998. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `x`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
