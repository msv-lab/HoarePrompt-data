Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is '100000000 '**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `max` (which is '100000000') followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string (`''`), after executing the code, `ans` becomes `'100000000 '`. All other variables remain unchanged.
