Output State: `t` is equal to the total number of iterations required to transform `x` into 1 by repeatedly applying the given operations, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is -99999998, -99999997, or -99999999, and `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min`, starting with the appropriate value based on the parity of `x`, with a space separating each value.

This final state occurs because the loop continues to modify `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` until `x` becomes 1. The number of iterations `t` will be the count of operations performed to reduce `x` to 1. The value of `max` and `min` will reflect the maximum and minimum values encountered during the process, respectively. The string `ans` will contain the sequence of these maximum and minimum values in reverse order, as each operation appends either `max` or `min` to the beginning of `ans`.
