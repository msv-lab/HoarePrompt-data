Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is either 124999999 or 24999998, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 min -100000000 ' or '-100000000 min -100000000'**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{min} ' + ans` concatenates the value of `min` (which is either -100000000 or -99999999) with a space and the current value of `ans`. Since `ans` is either '100000000 ' or '-100000000 ', the new value of `ans` will be either '100000000 min -100000000 ' or '-100000000 min -100000000 '. The values of `t`, `i`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.
