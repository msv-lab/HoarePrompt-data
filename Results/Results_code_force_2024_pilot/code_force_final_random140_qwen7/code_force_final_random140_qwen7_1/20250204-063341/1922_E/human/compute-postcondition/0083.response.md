Output State: `t` is the total number of iterations required for `x` to become 1, `i` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is 1, `min` is 1, and `ans` is an empty string.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute until `x` becomes 1. During each iteration, if `x` is even, `max` decreases by 1 and `x` is halved. If `x` is odd, `min` increases by 1 and `x` is decremented by 1. After `x` reaches 1, the loop terminates. Since `max` starts at 100000000 and decreases by 1 for each even `x`, and `min` starts at -100000000 and increases by 1 for each odd `x`, both `max` and `min` will reach 1 when `x` finally becomes 1. The variable `ans` is built up during each iteration but is ultimately reset to an empty string once `x` reaches 1 because the loop condition no longer holds.
