Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 3, `x` is either 62499999 or 12499999, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999 or remains 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is -99999998 or -99999999, `ans` is 'min ' + `ans'**

Explanation: The code `min += 1` increments the value of `min` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `min` can be either -100000000 or -99999999. After incrementing, `min` will now be -99999999 or -99999998, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
