Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is either 124999999 or 24999998, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 99999999 ' or '-100000000 100000000 '**

Explanation: The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Since `max` was either 99999999 or 100000000, after decrementing by 1, it becomes either 99999998 or 99999999. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
