Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 3, if `x` is even, `x` is updated to either 62499999 or 12499999, `max` is updated to either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is updated to either -100000000 or -99999999, and `ans` is updated to either '100000000 99999999' or '-100000000 100000000'. If `x` is odd, `x` is updated to either 124999998 or 24999997, `max` remains 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is updated to -99999999, and `ans` is updated to either '100000000 min -100000000' or '-100000000 min -100000000'.**

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain as per their conditional updates based on whether `x` is even or odd.
