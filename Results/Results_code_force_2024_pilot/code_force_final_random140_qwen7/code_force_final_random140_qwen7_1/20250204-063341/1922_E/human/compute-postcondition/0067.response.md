Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is either 50000000 or 0, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 -100000000' or '-100000000 100000000'**

Explanation: The code updates the `ans` variable by concatenating the string representation of `min` with a space and the current value of `ans`. Depending on the initial value of `min`, `ans` will be updated accordingly. If `min` is `-100000000`, `ans` becomes `'100000000 -100000000'`; if `min` is `-99999999`, `ans` becomes `'-100000000 100000000'`. The values of `t`, `i`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.
