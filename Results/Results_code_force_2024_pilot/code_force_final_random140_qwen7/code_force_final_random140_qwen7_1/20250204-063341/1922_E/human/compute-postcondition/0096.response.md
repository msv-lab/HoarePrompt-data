Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is 24999999, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is '100000000 '**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans` updates the value of `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `max` (which is '100000000') with a space and the current value of `ans` (which is an empty string). Therefore, `ans` becomes '100000000 '. The values of `t`, `i`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.
