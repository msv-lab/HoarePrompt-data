Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` is now `x // 2`, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a string combining `max` and the original `ans` with a space in between.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest integer. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
