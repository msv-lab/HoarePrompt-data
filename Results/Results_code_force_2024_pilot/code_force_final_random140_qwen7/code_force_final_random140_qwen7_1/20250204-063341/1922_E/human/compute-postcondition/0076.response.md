Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is either 12500000, 0, 24999999, or -1, `ans` is an empty string, `max` is 1**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides the value of `x` by 2 using integer division. Since `x` can be 25000000, 0, 49999999, or -1, after performing the operation, `x` will be 12500000, 0, 24999999, or -1 respectively. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `ans`, `max`) remain unchanged.
