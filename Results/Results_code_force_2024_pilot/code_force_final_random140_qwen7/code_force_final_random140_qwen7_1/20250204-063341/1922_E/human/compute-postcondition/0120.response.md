Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 3, `x` is either 62499999 or 12499999, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999 or remains 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is 'min ' + `ans`**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans` updates the value of `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `min` with a space and the current value of `ans`. Since `min` can be either `-100000000` or `-99999999`, and `ans` can be one of the following: `'100000000 99999999'`, `'99999998 99999999'`, `'100000000 min -100000000'`, or `'99999998 min -100000000'`, the updated `ans` will be:

- If `min` is `-100000000` and `ans` is `'100000000 99999999'`, then `ans` becomes `'min 100000000 99999999'`.
- If `min` is `-100000000` and `ans` is `'99999998 99999999'`, then `ans` becomes `'min 99999998 99999999'`.
- If `min` is `-100000000` and `ans` is `'100000000 min -100000000'`, then `ans` becomes `'min 100000000 min -100000000'`.
- If `min` is `-100000000` and `ans` is `'99999998 min -100000000'`, then `ans` becomes `'min 99999998 min -100000000'`.

Similarly, for the case where `min` is `-99999999` and `ans` is one of the above combinations, the updated `ans` will be:

- If `min` is `-99999999` and `ans` is `'100000000 99999999'`, then `ans` becomes `'min 100000000 99999999'`.
- If `min` is `-99999999` and `ans` is `'99999998 99999999'`, then `ans` becomes `'min 99999998 99999999'`.
- If `min` is `-99999999` and `ans` is `'100000000 min -100000000'`, then `ans` becomes `'min 100000000 min -100000000'`.
- If `min` is `-99999999` and `ans` is `'99999998 min -100000000'`, then `ans` becomes `'min 99999998 min -100000000'`.

Therefore, the output state is as described.
