Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - The variable `i` will take values from 0 to \(t-1\) during the loop execution.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the input value must be within the range of \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - The initial value of `i` will be 0 because the loop starts with `i = 0`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value `t`, ensuring it is within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0**
