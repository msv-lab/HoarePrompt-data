Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 3, `x` is either 62499999 or 12499999, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999 or remains 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 99999999 max' or '-100000000 100000000 max' or '100000000 min -100000000 max' or '-100000000 min -100000000 max'**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans` updates the value of `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `max` with a space and the existing value of `ans`. Since `max` can be one of the specified values (99999998, 99999999, 100000000), and `ans` can also be one of the specified combinations, the updated `ans` will include `max` at the beginning followed by a space and the original `ans` value.
