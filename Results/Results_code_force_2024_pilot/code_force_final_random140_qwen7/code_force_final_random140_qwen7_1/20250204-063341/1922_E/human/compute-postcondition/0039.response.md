Output State: `t` is equal to the total number of iterations required for `x` to become 1, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - `t`, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, and `ans` is a string containing alternating `max` and `min` values starting from `max` and ending with `min`.

This means that after all iterations, `t` will be the number of steps it took for `x` to reduce to 1, `max` will be reduced by `t` from its initial value of 100000000, `min` will be increased by `t` from its initial value of -100000000, and `ans` will contain a sequence of alternating `max` and `min` values, starting with `max` and ending with `min`.
