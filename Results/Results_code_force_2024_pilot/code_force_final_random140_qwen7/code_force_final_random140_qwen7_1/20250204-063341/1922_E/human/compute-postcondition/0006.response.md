Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.
2. **Determine the current state of the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - The loop will only proceed if `x` is not equal to 1.

3. **Check the current state of `x`**:
   - The problem statement mentions that `x` is an input integer. This means `x` could be any integer value, but for the loop to execute at least once, `x` must not be equal to 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `x` is an input integer, we cannot directly change its value. However, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `x` should not be equal to 1.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `x` is not equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string**
