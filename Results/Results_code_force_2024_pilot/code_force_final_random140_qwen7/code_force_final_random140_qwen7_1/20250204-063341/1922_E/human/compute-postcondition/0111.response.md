Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is either 124999999 or 24999998, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 min -100000000' or '-100000000 min -100000000'**

Explanation: The value of `min` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, the minimum value `min` could be either -100000000 or -99999999. After incrementing `min` by 1, the new value of `min` becomes -99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
