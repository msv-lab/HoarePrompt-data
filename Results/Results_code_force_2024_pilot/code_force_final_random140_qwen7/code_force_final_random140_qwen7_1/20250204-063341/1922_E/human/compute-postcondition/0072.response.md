Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 2. If `x` is even (either 25000000 or 0), `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, and `ans` is either '99999999 100000000 ' or '100000000 100000000'. If `x` is odd (either 49999999 or -1), `max` remains either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` becomes -99999999, and `ans` is either '100000000 -100000000' or '-100000000 100000000'.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged based on their conditional states.
