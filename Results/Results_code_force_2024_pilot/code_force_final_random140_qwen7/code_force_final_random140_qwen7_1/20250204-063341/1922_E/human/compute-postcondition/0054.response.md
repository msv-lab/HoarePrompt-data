Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is 50000000, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is '100000000 '**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 using integer division. Given that `x` was initially '100000000', after performing the operation `x = x // 2`, `x` becomes `50000000`. The other variables remain unchanged.
