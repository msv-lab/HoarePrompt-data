Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    max = 100000000
    min = -100000000
    ans = ''
    t = 0
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
            max -= 1
            x = x // 2
        else:
            ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
            min += 1
            x -= 1
        t += 1
    print(t)
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is equal to the total number of iterations required to transform `x` into 1 by repeatedly applying the given operations, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is -99999998, -99999997, or -99999999, and `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min`, starting with the appropriate value based on the parity of `x`, with a space separating each value.

This final state occurs because the loop continues to modify `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` until `x` becomes 1. The number of iterations `t` will be the count of operations performed to reduce `x` to 1. The value of `max` and `min` will reflect the maximum and minimum values encountered during the process, respectively. The string `ans` will contain the sequence of these maximum and minimum values in reverse order, as each operation appends either `max` or `min` to the beginning of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is 33, `i` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is 1, `min` is 1, `ans` is an empty string.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. Given the conditions described, `x` starts as a large number (specifically, it's set to half of the maximum value, which is 50000000) and decreases with each iteration. The loop alternates between decrementing `max` and incrementing `min`, appending the current value of `max` or `min` to `ans` respectively. After 33 iterations, `x` will eventually reach 1, breaking the loop. At this point, `t` will be 33, indicating the number of iterations executed. Both `max` and `min` will be reduced to 1, and `ans` will be an empty string since the loop ends when `x` equals 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is 26, `i` is 3, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is '100000000 99999999 99999998 99999997 99999996 99999995 ... -100000000 -99999999 -99999998 -99999997 -99999996 -99999995'.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute until `x` becomes 1. Given the initial value of `x` as 24999999, it takes 26 iterations for `x` to reduce to 1 through the operations defined in the loop (dividing by 2 when even and decrementing by 1 when odd). During these iterations, the `max` and `min` values are adjusted with each iteration, and the `ans` string accumulates the current values of `max` and `min` in reverse order as the loop progresses.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
