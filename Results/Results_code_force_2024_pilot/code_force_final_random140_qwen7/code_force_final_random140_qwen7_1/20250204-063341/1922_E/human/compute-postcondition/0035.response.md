Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` is `x` - 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999998 or -99999997, `ans` is 'min ans' where `min` is either -99999998 or -99999997 based on the parity of `x` and the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, making it `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
