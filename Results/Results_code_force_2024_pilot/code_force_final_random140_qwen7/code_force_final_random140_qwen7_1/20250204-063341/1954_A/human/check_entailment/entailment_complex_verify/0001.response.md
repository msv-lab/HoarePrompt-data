### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given solution step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `n <= k`: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, making it impossible for Alice to prevent this. Hence, the output is 'NO'.
     2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`: This condition checks if the number of parts that need to be painted differently to ensure that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color is within the limit `k`. Specifically, `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of different colors needed to ensure that no single color can cover all parts when repainted by Bob. If subtracting this from `n` results in a value less than or equal to `k`, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Hence, the output is 'Yes'.

3. **Output**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- The first condition `n <= k` is straightforward and correctly identifies cases where Bob can always repaint all parts.
- The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is more complex but also correct. It ensures that if the number of parts that need to be painted differently (`n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is within the limit `k`, then Alice can achieve her goal.

However, there is a flaw in the second condition. The logic behind `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is incorrect. Here's why:

- `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of different colors needed to ensure that no single color can cover all parts when repainted by Bob. This is not the correct way to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
- Instead, Alice needs to ensure that even after Bob repaints `k` parts, there will still be at least one part with a different color. This can be achieved if the number of different colors used is greater than `k`.

### Correct Approach:
- If `n > k`, Alice can use more than `k` different colors. Even if Bob repaints `k` parts, there will still be at least one part with a different color.
- Therefore, the correct condition should be `m > k`.

### Revised Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or m > k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment incorrectly identified the condition for Alice to win. The correct condition is `m > k`, not `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final:
Final: **False**
