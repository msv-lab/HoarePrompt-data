Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in its logic for determining whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Condition Check**: The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:` is flawed.
   - The condition `n <= k` checks if the total number of parts is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this is true, then Bob can indeed make all parts have the same color, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is also problematic. This condition checks if the number of parts that need to be painted differently from the majority (i.e., `math.ceil(n / m)` parts) is within the limit `k`. If this is true, then Bob can still make all parts have the same color, so the output should again be 'NO'.

2. **Correct Logic**: To ensure that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, Alice needs to paint the ribbon in such a way that the number of parts with different colors is more than `k`. Specifically, if the number of parts `n` is greater than `k`, and the number of distinct colors `m` is more than 1, then Alice can always paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if m > 1 and n > k:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color if the conditions `m > 1` and `n > k` are met.
