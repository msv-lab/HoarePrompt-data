Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, t, 1):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, then no change is made to `t`. Otherwise, `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `itest` is `i + 1`. If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, no changes are made to `t`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t` as well.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
