Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.**
