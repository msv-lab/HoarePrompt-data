Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, then no change is made to `t`. Otherwise, `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
