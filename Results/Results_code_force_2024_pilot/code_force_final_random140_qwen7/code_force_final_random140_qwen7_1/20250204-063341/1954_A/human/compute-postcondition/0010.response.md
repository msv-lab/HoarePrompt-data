Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, the value of `t` is not affected by these assignments, so `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `k`) are assigned the values of the input integers.
