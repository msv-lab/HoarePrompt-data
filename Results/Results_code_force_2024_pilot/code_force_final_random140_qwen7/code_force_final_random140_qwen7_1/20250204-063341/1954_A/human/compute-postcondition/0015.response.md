Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `itest` is `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. The variable `itest` is mentioned but its value is not updated by the given code; it is assumed to be `i + 1` from the initial state, but since `i` is not defined in the current context, `itest` remains as `i + 1`.
