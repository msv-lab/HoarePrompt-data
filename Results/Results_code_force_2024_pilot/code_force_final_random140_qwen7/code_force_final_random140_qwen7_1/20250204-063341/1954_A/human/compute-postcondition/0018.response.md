Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `itest` is `i + 1`. If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, no changes are made to `t`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t` as well.**
