Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since no values of `n`, `m`, or `k` are used in the print statement, and the string `'NO'` is hardcoded, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **'NO'**
