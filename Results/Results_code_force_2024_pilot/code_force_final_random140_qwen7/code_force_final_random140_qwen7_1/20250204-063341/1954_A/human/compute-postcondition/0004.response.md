Output: **NO**

Explanation: The initial state provides conditions for the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The statement simply prints the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the output will always be `'NO'`.
