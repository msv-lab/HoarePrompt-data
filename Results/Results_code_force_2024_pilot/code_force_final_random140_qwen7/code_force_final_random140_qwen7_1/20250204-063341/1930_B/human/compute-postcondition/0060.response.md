Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function determines whether to return a specific value based on the given t and n.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t` and `n`, and returns a value based on the conditions specified for `t` and `n`. However, since the function definition itself does not include any parameters, the description focuses on the implied input structure and expected behavior.
