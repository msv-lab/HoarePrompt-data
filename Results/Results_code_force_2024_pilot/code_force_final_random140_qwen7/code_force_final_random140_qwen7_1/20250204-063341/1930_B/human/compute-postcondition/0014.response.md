Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next odd number less than or equal to `a`, and `p` is a list containing the value of `i` from the previous iteration and now includes `i`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, a + 1, 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next odd number less than or equal to `a`.

5. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next odd number less than or equal to `a`.

6. **Next Odd Number**: To find the next odd number, we need to increment `i` by 2 (since the loop increments by 2).

7. **Updated State**: After the loop increments `i` by 2, `i` will be the next odd number. Therefore, `i` will be the next odd number after the current value of `i`.

8. **List `p`**: The list `p` already contains the value of `i` from the previous iteration and now includes the new value of `i`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is the next odd number after the current value of `i`.
- `p` remains the same, containing the values from the previous iterations.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is the next odd number after the previous value of `i`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i` from the previous iteration and now includes the new value of `i`**.
