Output State: **`i` is 5; `a` must be a positive integer greater than 5; `p` is a list containing 5.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 5) to the list `p`. Since `i` is 5, `p` becomes a list containing the single element 5. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.
