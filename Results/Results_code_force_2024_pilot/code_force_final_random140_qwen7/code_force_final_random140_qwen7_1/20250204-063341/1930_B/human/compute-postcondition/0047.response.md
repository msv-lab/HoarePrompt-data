Output State: **`i` is 6; `a` must be greater than 3; `p` is a list containing 6**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 6) to the list `p`. Since `i` is 6, `p` becomes a list containing the element 6. The value of `a` and the condition that `a` must be greater than 3 remain unchanged.
