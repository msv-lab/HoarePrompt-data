Output State: **`p` is a list containing the value of `i` added to the existing list.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since the initial value of `p` is not specified, we assume it to be a list. After executing the code, `p` will contain all its previous elements plus the new element `i`.
