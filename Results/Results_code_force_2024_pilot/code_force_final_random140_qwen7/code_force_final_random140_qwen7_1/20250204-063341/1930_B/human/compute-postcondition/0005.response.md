Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `p` is a list containing the value of `i` added to the existing list.
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(2, a + 1, 2)`.

### Understanding the Loop
- The loop iterates over even numbers starting from 2 up to `a` (inclusive).
- The variable `i` takes on values in steps of 2.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the current value of `i` is the last value it took before the current iteration.
   - Let's denote the last value of `i` as `i_last`.

2. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - The next value of `i` will be `i_last + 2`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `i_last + 2` is still within the range `[2, a]`.
   - Therefore, the condition for the next iteration is `2 <= i_last + 2 <= a`.

4. **Update the List `p`:**
   - In each iteration, the value of `i` is added to the list `p`.
   - After the current iteration, `p` contains the value of `i_last`.

### Adjusting the States
- The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`.
- We need to update the state of these variables for the next iteration.

### Updated State
- The value of `i` will be `i_last + 2`.
- The list `p` will contain the value of `i_last + 2` after the next iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`p` is a list containing the value of `i_last + 2` added to the existing list, `i` is `i_last + 2`**.

To provide a concrete example, let's assume `i_last` was 6 (from the previous iteration) and `a` is 10.

- `p` would contain the value 6.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be 8.
- `p` will then contain the value 8 after the next iteration.

So, the final state would be:

State: **`p` is a list containing the value 8 added to the existing list, `i` is 8**.
