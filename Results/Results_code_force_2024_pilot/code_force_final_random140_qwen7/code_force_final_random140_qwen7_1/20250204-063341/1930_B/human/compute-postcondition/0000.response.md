Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - The expression inside the `range()` function is `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`.
   - Therefore, the value of `int(input())` determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state before the loop starts is given: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - Additionally, the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the valid range.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` should be at least 1 (since `i` starts from 0) and should be a positive integer.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that the input value is a positive integer and meets the condition for the loop to start.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and the input value must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**.
