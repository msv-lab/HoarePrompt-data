Output State: **`i` is 4; `a` must be greater than 3; `p` is a list containing 4**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `p`. Since `i` is 4, `p` becomes a list containing the element 4. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it must still be greater than 3.
