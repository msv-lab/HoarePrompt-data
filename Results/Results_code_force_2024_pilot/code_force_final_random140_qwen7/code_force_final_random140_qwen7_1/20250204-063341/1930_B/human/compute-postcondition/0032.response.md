Output State: **`i` is 3; `a` must be at least 2; `p` is a list containing the value 3**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `p`. Since `i` is 3, `p` becomes a list containing the value 3. The other variables (`i` and `a`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
