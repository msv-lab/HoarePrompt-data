Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, and `x2` is equal to `r[4]`. The difference `(x2 - x1)` is odd, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y1` is adjusted to either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on whether `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`.
