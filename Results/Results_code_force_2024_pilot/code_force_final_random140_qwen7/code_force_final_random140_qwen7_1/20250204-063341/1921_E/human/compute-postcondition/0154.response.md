Postcondition: `i` is 3, `test_cases` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `answers` is a list with either one element 'Draw' or containing 'Alice', depending on the following conditions:
- If `clues[3] < clues[5]`, then `answers` is determined by the condition `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`.
- If `clues[3] >= clues[5]`, then `answers` is determined by the condition `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`.
