Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2]`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, and `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`; otherwise, `a` is equal to `m - y1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between `x2` and `x1` and assigns it to `b`. The value of `b` is specifically `x2 - x1`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `a` depends on the comparison between `y1` and `y2`, but since the exact values of `y1` and `y2` are not specified, `a` is expressed as either `y1 - 1` or `m - y1` based on the condition.
