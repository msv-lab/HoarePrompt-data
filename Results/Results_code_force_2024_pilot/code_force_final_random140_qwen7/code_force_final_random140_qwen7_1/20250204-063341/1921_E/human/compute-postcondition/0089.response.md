Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is increased by `a`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1` and \((x2 - x1) \% 2 == 0\).
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
- `a` is determined by the following conditions:
  - If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a = y1 - 1`.
  - Otherwise, `a = m - y1`.
- `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`.
- `x2` is decreased by `a`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('draw')` will execute and print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
