Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2]`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, and `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`; otherwise, `a` is equal to `m - y1`, `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
