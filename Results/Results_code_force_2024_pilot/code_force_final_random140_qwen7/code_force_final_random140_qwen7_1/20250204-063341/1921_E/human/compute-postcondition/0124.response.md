Output State: **`i` is 3, `test_cases` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `clues`. The variables `i` and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial states.
