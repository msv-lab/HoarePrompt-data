Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is the next element in the `answers` list.
- `answers` must have at least two more elements, meaning there are at least three elements in the `answers` list.

Given this information, `j` is the third element in the `answers` list because it is described as "the next element" after the first two elements.

Output: **the third element in the answers list**
