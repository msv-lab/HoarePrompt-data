Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2]`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y2` is less than `y1`, `a` is equal to `m - y1`.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `m - y1`. Given the initial conditions, `m` and `y1` retain their original values, and `a` is calculated based on these values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
