Output State: **`i` is 3, `test_cases` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `answers` is a list with one element 'Draw'**.

The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. Since `i`, `test_cases`, and `clues` were unaffected by this line of code, their states remain the same. The list `answers` now contains one additional element, 'Draw'.
