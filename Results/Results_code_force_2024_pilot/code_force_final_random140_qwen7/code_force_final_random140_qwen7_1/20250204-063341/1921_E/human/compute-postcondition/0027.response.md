Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4]`.
- The difference `(x2 - x1)` is odd.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `y1` is equal to `y2`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
