Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2]`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.**

This output state reflects that the variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` have been assigned the values from the list `r` at indices 0 through 5, respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the assignment operation.
