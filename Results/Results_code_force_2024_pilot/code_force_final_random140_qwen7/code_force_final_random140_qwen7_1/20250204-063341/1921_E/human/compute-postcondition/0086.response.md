Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`; otherwise, `a` is equal to `m - y1`, `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is decreased by `a`.**

Explanation: The code `x2 -= a` subtracts the value of `a` from `x2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
