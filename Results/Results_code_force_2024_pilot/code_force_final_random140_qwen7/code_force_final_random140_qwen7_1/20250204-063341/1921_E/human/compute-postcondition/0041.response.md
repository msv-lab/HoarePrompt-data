`x1` is incremented by `a`. The value of `x1` was originally `r[2] + 1`, so now it becomes `r[2] + 1 + a`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `x2`, `b`, and `y2 - y1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is odd, `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`.**
