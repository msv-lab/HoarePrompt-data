Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, `y1` is now equal to `m`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `a` is equal to `m - y1` if `y2` is less than `y1`; otherwise, `a` is equal to `y1 - 1`, `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y2` is increased by `a`.**

Explanation: The code `y2 += a` increases the value of `y2` by `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
