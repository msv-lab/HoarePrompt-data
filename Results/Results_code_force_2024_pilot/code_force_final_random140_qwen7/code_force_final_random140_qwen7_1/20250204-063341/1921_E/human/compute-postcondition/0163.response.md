Output State: **`i` is 10000 (or the exact value of `test_cases`), `test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 10000 elements (or the exact number of elements based on `test_cases`), and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer for each iteration.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the variable `i` will be equal to `test_cases` (since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `test_cases - 1`), `test_cases` remains unchanged as it was an input parameter, `answers` will contain exactly `test_cases` number of elements, each determined by the logic inside the loop based on the input `clues` for each iteration.
