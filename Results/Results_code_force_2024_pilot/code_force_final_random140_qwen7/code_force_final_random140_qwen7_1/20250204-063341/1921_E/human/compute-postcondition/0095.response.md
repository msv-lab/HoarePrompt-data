Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, `y1` is 1, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `a` is equal to `m - y1` because `y2` is less than `y1`, `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y2` is decreased by `a`**.

Explanation: The code `y2 -= a` decreases the value of `y2` by `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
