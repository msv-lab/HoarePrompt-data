Output State: **`i` is 3, `test_cases` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `answers` is a list with one element 'Draw'**.

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Since `answers` was not defined before, it is initialized as a new list containing only the string `'Draw'`. The values of `i`, `test_cases`, and `clues` remain unchanged from their initial states.
