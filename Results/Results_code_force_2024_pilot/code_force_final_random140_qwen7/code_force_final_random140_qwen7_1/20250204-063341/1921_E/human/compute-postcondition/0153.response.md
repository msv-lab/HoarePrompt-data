Postcondition: `i` is 3, `test_cases` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `answers` is a list with either one element 'Draw' or containing 'Alice', depending on whether the condition `clues[3] < clues[5]` is true or false, and the value of `answers` is determined based on the specified conditions in both the if and else parts.
