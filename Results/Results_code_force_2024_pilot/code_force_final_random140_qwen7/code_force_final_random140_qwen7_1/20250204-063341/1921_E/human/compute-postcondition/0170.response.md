Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, printing each element in the `answers` list exactly once.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, every single element in the `answers` list has been printed exactly once to the console. The variable `j` would have iterated through all elements of the `answers` list, starting from the first element and ending with the last element. Since the loop runs for the length of the `answers` list, which is equal to the value of `test_cases`, `j` would have printed all 10000 elements (or the exact number based on `test_cases`) of the `answers` list.
