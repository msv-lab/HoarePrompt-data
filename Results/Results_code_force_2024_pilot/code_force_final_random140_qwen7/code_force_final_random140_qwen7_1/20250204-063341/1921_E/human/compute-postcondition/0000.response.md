Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9.**

The code `r = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `r`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and is not affected by the input operation. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 still holds. The values of `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are now stored in the list `r` as integers.
