Output State: **`i` is 3, `test_cases` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `answers` is a list with one element 'Alice'**.

Explanation: The line `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Since `i`, `test_cases`, and `clues` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. The list `answers` now contains one additional element, which is `'Alice'`.
