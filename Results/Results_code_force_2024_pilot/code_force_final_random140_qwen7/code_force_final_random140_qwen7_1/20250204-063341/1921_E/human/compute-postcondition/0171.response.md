Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of six positive integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. The function returns a value based on the conditions given for these integers.**

- `h` and `w` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq w \leq 10^9\).
- `x_a` and `y_a` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x_a \leq h\) and \(1 \leq y_a \leq w\).
- `x_b` and `y_b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x_b \leq h\) and \(1 \leq y_b \leq w\), and it is guaranteed that either \(x_a \neq x_b\) or \(y_a \neq y_b\).

The function processes these integers and returns a value based on the given conditions.
