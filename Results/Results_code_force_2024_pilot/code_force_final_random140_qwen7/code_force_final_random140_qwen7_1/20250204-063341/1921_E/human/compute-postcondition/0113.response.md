Functionality: **The function processes input coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) to determine if player Alice or Bob wins based on certain conditions. It reads six integers from input representing the coordinates and dimensions of a grid. Depending on the relative positions of the coordinates and their differences, it prints either "Alice", "Bob", or "draw". The function does not return any value.**
