Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`. `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference `(x2 - x1)` is odd, and `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`**.

In this output state, the value of `x1` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial relationships and values from the initial state.
