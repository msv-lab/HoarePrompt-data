Postcondition: `i` is 3, `test_cases` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `answers` is a list with one element either 'Draw' or 'Bob' depending on whether `clues[3] > clues[5]` is true or false.
