Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2]`.
- `y1` is equal to `r[3]`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4]`.
- `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference `(x2 - x1)` is odd.
- `y1` is equal to `y2`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
