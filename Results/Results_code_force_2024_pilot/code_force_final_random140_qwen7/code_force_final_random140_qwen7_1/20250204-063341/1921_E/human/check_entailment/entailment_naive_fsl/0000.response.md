Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner is flawed and does not consider all possible moves and scenarios optimally.

One issue is in the handling of the `func_1` function. The logic for determining the winner based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob's chips is not fully implemented. Here are a few specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Move Logic**: The program attempts to move Alice's chip in certain scenarios but does not always handle the optimal moves correctly. For example, the logic for moving Alice's chip to `(x1 + a, y1 - a)` or `(x1 + a, y1 + a)` is not always optimal.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For instance, it does not correctly determine the winner when Alice and Bob are in positions where they can force a win or draw.

3. **Inconsistent Logic**: The logic for determining the winner is inconsistent and does not cover all possible scenarios. For example, the program does not always correctly handle the case where Alice can force a win by moving to a position that Bob cannot counter effectively.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
3 3 1 1 3 3
```

- Alice starts at (1, 1).
- Bob starts at (3, 3).

In this scenario, Alice can move to (2, 2), and Bob can only move to (2, 2) or (2, 1) or (2, 3). Since Alice can force Bob into a position where he loses, the correct output should be "Alice". However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly and outputs "Draw".

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
