Reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The provided code correctly handles the logic for determining the winner based on the given rules. It checks various conditions to see if Alice or Bob can force a win or if the game results in a draw.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `x2 <= x1`, the game immediately ends in a draw.
   - When `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0` (i.e., the difference is odd), Alice can potentially force a win by moving her chip down and adjusting the position to match Bob's chip.
   - When `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0` (i.e., the difference is even), Bob can potentially force a win by moving his chip up and adjusting the position to match Alice's chip.

3. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - The code correctly checks if Alice or Bob can force a win by ensuring the relative positions and movements adhere to the game rules.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the difference between the x-coordinates is sound.

4. **Output**:
   - The code prints the correct outcomes ("Alice", "Bob", or "Draw") based on the given test cases.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules.

Correctness: **True**
